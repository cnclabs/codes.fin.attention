retek s solution historically  large and mid sized retailers have relied upon custom built systems  often developed internally  to manage business transactions with trading partners and customers 
these legacy systems are typically built on s mainframe technology  are not internet enabled  and do not permit collaboration among a retailer s partners  suppliers and other members of the supply chain 
more recently  retailers have begun to purchase packaged solutions designed specifically for the retail industry 
many of these products lack the scalability retailers require to manage the large amounts of data their business generates 
some retailers have also adopted enterprise resource planning systems 
these complex systems can be expensive to implement and maintain  typically lack the scalability required by retailers  and do not have specific core retail functionality 
today  retailers face the additional challenge of operating in a very competitive multi channel environment 
as retailers expand their sales outlets to include the internet  catalog  kiosk and other distribution networks  the complexity of managing inventory and meeting customer demands places tremendous pressure on their business processes and it infrastructure 
to meet consumer expectations  a retailer needs to deliver the retailing experience on the customer s terms  which means having the right product  at the right time and in the right place across the multi channel touch points 
retailers need strong forecasting  planning  allocation  replenishment and merchandising functions to profitably achieve this goal 
a comprehensive  integrated software infrastructure that spans from supplier to consumer and gives the retailer visibility  flexibility and control to meet demand  is required for successful retailers to compete effectively 
we believe a market opportunity exists to provide retailers with a software solution that is designed specifically for the retail industry 
this solution should be easy to use  leverage a retailer s existing investments in information technology and be sufficiently flexible to meet the specific needs of several retail sectors  such as fashion  hard lines  mass merchandise or food and drug

these programs are targeted at key information technology executives and business users  as well as chief information officers and other senior executives 
revenue generated from our direct sales channel accounted for approximately   and of our total revenue in  and  respectively 
to date  we have not experienced difficulties in obtaining raw materials for the manufacture of our products 
we had no material backlog of orders as of december  revenues derived from and expenses associated with our business operations are not generally subject to seasonal fluctuations 
financial information concerning us for each of the three fiscal years ended december   and  including the amount of total revenue contributed by classes of similar products or services that accounted for or more of our consolidated revenue in any one of those periods and information with respect to our operations by geographic area  is set forth in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in item of this annual report on form k beginning on page research and development our research and development group has been a critical component of our overall success 
as of december   our research and development group was comprised of individuals in atlanta  ga  cincinnati  oh  rochester  mn  minneapolis  mn  houston  tx and cambridge  uk 
in addition  we have developed close alliances with a number of consulting companies to provide additional staffing if required 
these relationships allow us to increase our development capacity as quickly as necessary to address new market and product demand 
our research and development group is organized on a centralized basis 
our research and development group is responsible for product development  product management processes  implementation of development strategy and release path  delivery and support of our software applications 
the research and development group also has resources organized around specific product offerings 
the research and development group is also responsible for overall quality assurance and testing processes  documentation  application architecture and methodology 
the research and development group operates with a well defined development methodology 
this methodology enables the delivery of high quality products in a timely and predictable manner 
it involves the traditional checkpoints of development processes such as business requirements  functional and technical specifications  unit  string and integration test plans and regression analysis 
in addition  we use a highly interactive review process to engage future users of the product in the product release cycle through iterative prototypes to ensure the application design goal is met 
speed to market is critical to our success 
we believe that we have effectively used build  buy  and partner strategies to expand our solution offerings 
the key in using each of these strategies is the consistency in the underlying technologies and an overall application architecture that allows modular design and development 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in the fiscal years   and  respectively 
we believe that significant investments in research and development will be required in the future to remain competitive 
competition the markets for our software solutions are intensely competitive  constantly evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
we encounter competition in our products and services from a number of different sources  including in house technical staffs  traditional enterprise resource planning vendors and other vendors of retail specific solutions 
of these vendors  our principal competitors include i technologies  jda software  manhattan associates  manugistics and sap 
we compete with a substantial number of other companies focused on providing point solution software applications for specific segments of the retail application market 
in addition  there are new market entrants that may offer competitive products in the future 
we believe that our ability to compete depends on many factors both within and beyond our control  including the ease of use  performance  features  price and reliability of our solutions as compared to those of our competitors  the timing and market acceptance of new solutions and enhancements to existing solutions developed by us and our competitors  the quality of our customer service  and the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts 
we believe that our product solution suite is better than those of our competitors in its performance  features and reliability 
in addition  we have in the past introduced new solutions and enhancements to our existing solutions in a timelier manner 
our prices are generally higher than our competitors reflecting  we believe  the added value of our software solutions 
because the market for our software solutions is intensely competitive and rapidly evolving  we cannot be assured that we will maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors  especially those with greater name recognition and greater financial  marketing and other resources 
we expect competition may increase as a result of software industry consolidation 
for example  a number of enterprise software companies have acquired point solution providers to expand their product offerings 
our competitors may also package their products in ways that may discourage users from purchasing our products 
current and potential competitors may establish alliances among themselves or with third parties or adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share 
in addition  new competitors could emerge and rapidly capture market share 
proprietary rights and licensing our success and ability to compete are in part dependent upon our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology 
we rely on a combination of trademark  trade secret  and copyright law and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology 
we seek to protect our source code for our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws 
we license our software under signed license agreements  which impose restrictions on the licensee s ability to utilize the software 
finally  we seek to avoid disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code 
we rely on technology that we license from third parties  including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our line of products to perform key functions 
for example  we license the e gate enterprise application integration software from seebeyond corporation  business intelligence software from microstrategy  inc and the accumate component from lucent technologies 
these licenses are non exclusive  worldwide and royalty based 
the royalties we paid seebeyond  microstrategy and lucent under these licenses were  in each case  less than of our total revenue in each of the  and fiscal years 
we have also entered into a technology license agreement with hnc  giving us a license to specified hnc predictive technology 
this license is non exclusive  non transferable  worldwide  perpetual and royalty free 
we also license and will continue to license certain products integral to our products and services from other third parties  including accenture  ibm  oracle corp 
and sun microsystems  inc if we are unable to continue any of theses licenses  we will face delays in releases of our software until equivalent technology can be identified  licensed or developed  and integrated into our current products 
these delays  if they occur  could seriously harm our business 
there has been a substantial amount of litigation in the software and internet industries regarding intellectual property rights 
it is possible that in the future third parties may claim that we or our current or potential future software solutions infringe on their intellectual property 
we expect that software product developers and providers of electronic commerce products will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlap 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all  which could seriously harm our business 
environmental matters we are in substantial compliance with federal  state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment 
we do not expect that continued compliance with these provisions would have any material effect upon our capital expenditures and earnings 
employees at december   we had employees based in north america  europe  asia  australia and other countries 
none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement  and we believe that our relations with our employees are good

item legal proceedings federal litigation in the us district court for the southern district of new york between june and june   three class action complaints alleging violations of sections and of the securities act of and sections b and a of the securities exchange act of were filed in the southern district of new york against us  certain of our current and former officers and directors  and certain underwriters of our initial public offering ipo 
on august   these actions were consolidated for pre trial purposes before a single judge along with similar actions involving the initial public offerings of numerous other issuers 
on february   the parties signed and filed a stipulation dismissing the consolidated action without prejudice against us and the individual officers and directors  which the court approved and entered as an order on march  on april   the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in which they elected to proceed with their claims against us and the individual officers and directors only under sections b and a of the securities exchange act of the amended complaint alleges that the prospectus filed in connection with the ipo was false or misleading in that it failed to disclose i that the underwriters allegedly were paid excessive commissions by certain of the underwriters customers in return for receiving shares in the ipo and ii that certain of the underwriters customers allegedly agreed to purchase additional shares of our common stock in the aftermarket in return for an allocation of shares in the ipo 
the complaint further alleges that the underwriters offered to provide positive market analyst coverage for the company after the ipo  which had the effect of manipulating the market for our stock 
plaintiffs contend that  as a result of the omissions from the prospectus and alleged market manipulation through the use of analysts  the price of our common stock was artificially inflated between november  and december   and that the defendants are liable for unspecified damages to those persons who purchased our common stock during that period 
on july   the company and the individual defendants  along with the rest of the issuers and related officer and director defendants  filed a joint motion to dismiss based on common issues 
opposition and reply papers were filed 
the court rendered its decision on february   which granted dismissal in part of a claim against one of the individual defendants and denied dismissal in all other respects 
the class action suits may now proceed to the discovery phase 
we intend to defend against these claims vigorously 
securities class action litigation can result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources  which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
federal litigation in the us district court for the district of minnesota between october  and december   several purported shareholder class action suits were filed in federal district court in minnesota 
the court has not yet certified any class 
the complaints allege  among other things  violations of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of against us and certain of our current and former officers and directors 
specifically  the complaints allege that  among other things  between october  and july  the class period  defendants made false and misleading statements and or concealed material adverse facts from the market in press releases  presentations and sec disclosures 
the complaints claim that our company and the individual defendants misled the market with respect to  among other things our alliance with ibm  our ability to develop certain software  and our expectations regarding certain customer sales 
plaintiffs further allege that defendants manipulated financial statements and failed to disclose problems with existing and potential customer deals  which led to the company s stock price being artificially inflated during the class period 
the plaintiffs seek compensatory damages and other unspecified relief 
the federal court in minnesota appointed a lead plaintiff and lead plaintiff s counsel on february   and we anticipate that the lead plaintiff will file a consolidated complaint 
after such consolidated complaint is filed  defendants will answer or respond to these allegations 
we dispute plaintiffs allegations in the federal class actions in minnesota and believe that the allegations are subject to a variety of meritorious defenses 
we intend to establish a vigorous defense 
while there can be no assurance  and while the outcome of federal class action litigation cannot be predicted with certainty  our management currently believes that the ultimate outcome of the federal class action litigation in minnesota is unlikely to have a material adverse affect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
despite our belief that the federal class action complaints in minnesota are without merit  it is possible that the federal litigation in minnesota could be resolved adversely 
were the federal court in minnesota to issue a ruling or rulings unfavorable to us  such ruling or rulings could have a material adverse impact on the results of operations for the period in which the ruling occurs  or in a period thereafter 
state derivative litigation in hennepin county  minnesota in addition to the above federal litigation  in december two shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed in state court in hennepin county  minnesota  against certain of our current and former officers and directors  naming us as a nominal defendant 
plaintiffs in both derivative cases have agreed to coordinate their respective actions  and the process of coordination is currently underway 
the derivative suits claim that certain of our officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties to us and our stockholders by i selling shares of our common stock while in possession of material adverse non public information regarding our business and prospects  and ii disseminating inaccurate information regarding our business and prospects to the market and or failing to correct such inaccurate information 
the derivative complaints seek compensatory and other damages  restitution  disgorgement  and other legal and equitable relief 
as stated above  the complaints are brought derivatively on our behalf  and consequently do not seek relief from us

overview we completed our initial public offering on november  prior to the completion of our initial public offering  we were a wholly owned subsidiary of hnc software inc  a business to business software company that developed and marketed predictive software solutions 
on october   hnc announced it had completed its separation of retek from hnc through a distribution prorata to hnc s stockholders of hnc s entire holding of million shares of our common stock 
after the close of the nasdaq national market on september   hnc stockholders who were stockholders of record as of september  were distributed shares of our common stock for each share of hnc stock held as of the record date 
we generate revenue from the sale of software licenses  maintenance and support contracts  and professional consulting and contract development services 
until the fourth quarter of  we generally licensed products to customers on a perpetual basis and recognized revenue upon delivery of the products 
starting in the fourth quarter of  we revised the terms of our software licensing agreements for the majority of our software products sold 
under the revised terms  we provide technical advisory services after the delivery of our products to help customers exploit the full value and functionality of our products 
revenue from the sale of software licenses under these agreements is recognized over the period the technical advisory services are performed if all other criteria for recognition of revenue are met 
these periods of technical advisory services generally range from to months  as determined by each customer s objectives 
deferred revenue consists principally of the unrecognized portion of amounts received under license and maintenance service agreements 
deferred license revenue is recognized ratably over the technical advisory period if applicable  or on a percentage of completion basis  or when all criteria for recognition of revenue are met based on the contract terms 
deferred maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the service agreement 
customers who license our software generally purchase maintenance contracts  typically covering renewable annual periods 
in addition  customers may purchase consulting services  which are customarily billed at a fixed daily rate plus out of pocket expenses 
contract development services  including new product development services  are typically performed for a fixed fee 
we also offer training services that are billed on a per student or per class session basis 
significant trends and developments in our business economic conditions in the retail industry 
recently  we have faced new challenges as the result of progressively weakening worldwide economic conditions 
we believe that these global economic conditions have resulted in substantial reductions in information technology spending by our customers and potential customers  and have delayed the closing of some software license transactions 
the retail industry will continue to be negatively impacted if current adverse economic conditions and fear of war or terrorist attacks persist for an extended time period 
weakened global economic conditions have in the past  and may in the future  lengthen our selling cycles and negatively impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
new products and markets 
our customers have indicated to us the importance of good information technology solutions at the retail store level because store operations are the largest component of operating expenses incurred by retailers 
in  we acquired substantially all of the technology of chelsea market systems  llc chelsea  which included a point of sale software solution 
with this acquisition  we acquired a point of sale solution that  when combined with our existing product suite  allows us to better address our customers technology requirements in the store 
also  at the end of the first quarter  we introduced our retek solution  which is designed to make our products work together more effectively  and therefore increase their value to customers and potential customers 
we are continuing to focus on the tier retail market  but in  we also increased our sales and marketing efforts in the tier retail market 
we have recently experienced increased sales activity in the tier market that we would expect to continue to contribute to revenue in future periods 
we believe that our new store offerings  such as the point of sale offering  have contributed to the increase in sales activity in the tier market 
mix of domestic and international business 
revenue attributable to customers outside of north america accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 
we believe that this increase in international sales is a result of investments we have made in our sales and marketing presence in europe and asia  as well as a growing acceptance of packaged software solutions by retailers outside of north america 
in  we created a new subsidiary in japan  retek japan kk  to bolster retek s presence in the region 
although we cannot be certain that this trend toward a larger percentage of our sales being derived from international customers will continue  we believe that our investments in international sales and marketing strengthen our competitive position in these markets 
growth in our customer base 
our customer base has grown from over retailers at the end of to over retailers at the end of we believe that the growth of our customer base is primarily attributable to our increased market penetration and the breadth of our solution suite 
our investments in research and development and acquisitions and alliances have helped us bring these new software solutions to the market 
most recently  our acquisition of substantially all of the technology of chelsea is an example of a new product offering that has expanded our market opportunity  with the offering of a point of sale solution based upon an easy to use java architecture 
although we also intend to expand the number of solutions sold to existing customers  we expect our product expansion and sales and marketing efforts to result in continued growth in our customer base 
cost containment measures 
in response to global economic conditions in and the resulting impact upon our business  we put into place cost containment measures during the second half of to align our cost structure with anticipated revenue and to optimize cash flow 
we reduced our workforce  reduced the cost of outside contractors  reduced travel expenses and reduced the amount of leased space utilized see note restructuring and other in our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
acquisitions and strategic relationships webtrak limited on october   we completed the purchase of all the outstanding capital stock of webtrak limited 
webtrak owns the webtrack critical path and portfolio private label products that we currently distribute 
in connection with the purchase of webtrak  we issued to former webtrak shareholders notes  which were due on november   in the principal amount of million and a convertible note  which was due on november   in the principal amount of million 
the convertible note was  at the option of the holder  convertible at the time of payment into the number of shares of our common stock equal to the principal amount of the note divided by our initial public offering price of 
on november   we issued  shares of our common stock to the holder of the convertible note in full satisfaction of our obligations 
the remaining notes were paid in full on their due date 
hightouch technologies  inc on may   we completed our acquisition of hightouch technologies  inc  a provider of real time transaction management and customer service solutions that support multi channel customer interactions 
hightouch owns certain direct consumer management technologies that we have incorporated into retek customer order management  our enterprise level customer interaction system 
in connection with the purchase of hightouch  we paid million in cash  including direct acquisition costs  and issued  shares of our common stock to the former sole shareholder of hightouch 
multiasia  inc on june   we signed a shareholders agreement  a resellers agreement  a consulting services agreement and a subscription agreement with multiasia  inc mai  for  shares or of the shares of mai 
mai is a business to business and business to consumer web based e commerce company in the people s republic of china 
in exchange for the common shares  mai received the right to use certain of our software solutions and the right to sell our software solutions to the e business community in the republic of china 
the estimated value of the shares received of million was initially accounted for under the cost method and was included as a component of other assets 
the corresponding million value of the software solutions was recorded as a component of deferred revenue 
as a result of evaluating the value of our investment in mai  we determined that no significant future cash flows are probable 
accordingly  we removed the cost method investment and deferred revenue from our balance sheet during the third quarter of the transaction with mai had no impact on our results of operations or cash flows in  or ibm on september   we entered into a strategic relationship with international business machines corporation 
pursuant to this relationship  retek and ibm agreed to jointly market  sell  and service a comprehensive retail e business solution consisting of retek applications and ibm software and hardware technologies 
in connection with entering into this relationship  we and ibm entered into a common stock purchase agreement pursuant to which we issued  shares of our common stock to ibm in exchange for ibm entering into the relationship and ibm providing to us  at no cost  ibm hardware and software for use by us during the initial term of the relationship 
this arrangement has been accounted for as a capital lease of the hardware and software 
accordingly  the aggregate fair value of our common shares issued of million has been included in property and equipment and was amortized using the straight line method over the twenty seven month term of this portion of the arrangement 
accumulated amortization for these assets was  and million  respectively as of december   and the stock purchase agreement also requires us to issue shares of our common stock to ibm upon reaching certain revenue targets related to our software applications sold under the joint marketing and selling arrangements through under the stock purchase agreement  we will be obligated to pay ibm million related to in shares of our common stock if the annual revenue target  as stated in the stock purchase agreement  is met 
the stock purchase agreement provides for increases or decreases of the amounts to be paid to ibm in the event this revenue target is exceeded or is partially met 
the revenue targets for the years ended december  and were not met  therefore  no amounts were paid to ibm under this agreement with respect to sales in and henderson ventures  inc in april  we signed a stock purchase agreement  a warrant agreement and a software development and distribution agreement with henderson ventures  inc henderson 
in connection with these agreements  we issued a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock  which were reserved for issuance  in exchange for an ownership interest of approximately of the outstanding common stock of henderson and a distribution agreement to resell the developed software 
under the software development and distribution agreement  we are required to pay royalties to henderson for any software sold by us that we developed in conjunction with henderson 
the fair value of the warrant of million at that time was calculated using the black scholes valuation model and million was considered to be the value of the henderson common stock 
the warrant issued to henderson is fully vested with a term of five years and is exercisable at per share 
the fair value of the warrant of million was calculated using the black scholes valuation model using the following assumptions dividend yield of  risk free interest rate of  contractual life of five years and a volatility of 
because our relationship with henderson has not generated software sales for us to date  the increasing uncertainty about retailers future capital investments and other factors  we determined that an evaluation of the recoverability of the intangible asset related to henderson was appropriate 
as a result  we determined that no significant future cash flows are probable from our relationship with henderson and the net book value of the intangible asset related to the software development and distribution agreement of million was impaired and was written off during the third quarter of in addition  we concluded that our cost method investment in henderson of million was impaired and was written off in and is reflected as a component of general and administrative expense 
the write off of million was a non cash expense and is reflected in the statement of operations as impairment of intangible asset 
accenture on may   we established a strategic relationship with accenture llp accenture pursuant to which accenture became a development partner for our predictive applications 
in connection with entering into this relationship  we issued  shares of our common stock valued at million to proquire llc proquire  an affiliate of accenture  in exchange for the license from proquire to us of certain intellectual property to enable us to enhance our suite of retail specific software 
our common stock that was issued to accenture was valued at the average closing price of our common stock for the two days before  the day of  and the two days following the announcement of the accenture arrangement  or per share 
the value of our common shares issued for the specific intellectual property of accenture is included as a component of intangible assets and is being amortized using the straight line method over the five year life of the agreement 
the agreement with accenture also requires us to issue to accenture warrants to purchase our common stock upon our achievement of certain revenue milestones in fiscal years    and the maximum number of warrants to be issued in each fiscal year is limited to of the number of shares of our common stock then outstanding 
for any amounts earned by accenture in excess of of our common stock then outstanding  we may elect to pay in cash  rather than issue additional warrants 
the revenue targets for the year ended december   were not met  therefore  no warrants were issued to accenture under this agreement with respect to sales in on february   we entered into several new long term agreements with accenture 
accenture will provide us with a portion of our required development resources to make custom modifications of our software and to develop software that is funded by customers 
additionally  accenture hired the employees in our training  translation and documentation departments and will provide resources to us in these areas as an outsourcing partner 
in order to obtain competitive rates  we have agreed to utilize a certain minimum number of annual development days of accenture resources 
we entered into these agreements to manage the variability in the demand for services and to enhance our ability to provide solutions to customers at competitive rates

this purchased software is being amortized using the straight line method over months 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  based on historical experience  and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop  as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the american institute of certified public accountants  and in accordance with the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
we recognize software license revenue upon meeting each of the following criteria execution of a license agreement or contract  delivery of software  the license fee is fixed or determinable  collectibility of the proceeds is assessed as being probable  and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe exists to allocate revenue to undelivered elements of the arrangement 
vsoe is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately  or if not yet sold separately  is established by authorized management 
starting in the fourth quarter of  we revised the terms of the software licensing agreements for the majority of the software products sold 
under these terms  we provide technical advisory services after the delivery of our products to help our customers exploit the full value and functionality of our products 
revenue from the sale of software licenses under these agreements is recognized over the period that the technical advisory services are performed because vsoe does not exist for our technical advisory services 
these periods of technical advisory services generally range from to months  as determined by each customer s objectives 
for sales made through distributors  resellers and original equipment manufacturers  we recognize revenue at the time these partners report to us that they have sold the software to the end user and all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
service revenue includes maintenance revenue  which is deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance period  and revenue from consulting and training services  which is recognized as services are performed 
consulting services are customarily billed at a fixed daily rate plus out of pocket expenses 
our revenue from contract development services is generally recognized as the services are performed using the percentage of completion method based on costs incurred to date compared to total estimated costs at completion 
amounts received under contracts in advance of performance are recorded as deferred revenue and are generally recognized within one year from receipt 
contract losses are recorded as a charge to income in the period such losses are first identified 
unbilled accounts receivable are stated at estimated realizable value 
deferred revenue consists primarily of deferred license and maintenance revenue 
deferred tax assets as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgement is required in determining whether any valuation allowance should be recorded against our net deferred tax asset 
during the three months ended september   we determined that it was appropriate to record a full valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets 
the establishment of a full deferred tax valuation allowance was determined to be appropriate in light of revenue decreases in the third quarter of  our operating losses for the three and nine months ended september   our expectation of a significant loss for the full year and the added uncertainty of the market in which we operate 
as of december   we have recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of million 
despite the full valuation allowance  the income tax benefits related to these deferred tax assets will remain available to offset future taxable income 
allowance for doubtful accounts our software license and installation agreements and commercial development contracts are primarily with large customers in the retail industry 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
as of december   we have an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and other long lived assets may not be recoverable we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
the aggregate value of our net property and equipment and net intangible assets was million as of december  in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective and as a result  we ceased to amortize approximately million of goodwill 
we had recorded approximately million of amortization on these amounts during and would have recorded approximately million of amortization during in lieu of amortization  we performed an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and will review goodwill for impairment on annual basis thereafter 
upon completion of our review we determined that no goodwill impairment charge needed to be recorded in  however  there can be no assurances that subsequent reviews will not result in material impairment charges 
accrued restructuring costs in the fourth quarter of  we began implementation of a restructuring plan intended to bring our operating expenses in line with expected revenues due to concerns with a weakening global economy and decreasing capital expenditures by retailers 
actions taken included a reduction of our workforce and a reduction in the amount of leased space 
the restructuring plan includes workforce reductions of employees across most business functions and geographic regions and all employees were notified in of benefits to be received 
we recorded a charge for severance and related benefits of million of which we have paid million 
as of december   of these employees have been separated 
the remainder will be separated through the third quarter of we also recorded a net loss on lease abandonment of million in the fourth quarter of this lease abandonment loss consists of the payments to be made for the remaining lease term of the abandoned space that aggregates million  net of estimated sublease income of million 
the lease terms on the leased space to be abandoned ranges from five to eleven years 
management has made its best estimates of expected sublease income over the remaining term of the abandoned leases 
the estimated sublease income amount is highly judgmental and includes assumptions regarding the periods of sublease and the price per square foot to paid by the sublessors 
our plan calls for the affected space to be abandoned by us at various dates through the third quarter of as required by the applicable accounting standards  we will review these estimates each quarter and make adjustments  as necessary  to reflect management s best estimates

total revenue increased to million in and to million in from million in license and maintenance revenue 
license and maintenance revenue increased to million in and to million in from million in the increase in in both dollar and percentage basis was less than in due to a slow down in the us and world economy and the fact that our potential customers are more deliberately evaluating solutions  which resulted in extended sales cycles 
the increase in license revenue was primarily due to the addition of new customers and an increase in the average dollar sale per customer 
as noted above in the section entitled overview  we revised the terms of our software license agreements starting in the fourth quarter of so that revenue is generally recognized over a number of quarters rather than upon delivery 
due to the revised terms of the software license agreements  year over year revenue growth increased at a slower rate in maintenance revenue increased million and million in and  respectively  due to a growing base of customers that have installed our software solutions

these non cash charges consist of amortization of stock based compensation and amortization of purchased software 
cost of license and maintenance revenue presents separately amortization of purchased software 
we believe that the presentation of these charges separately on the face of the statement of operations facilitates the understanding of the individual statement of operations line items 
deferred stock based compensation represents the difference between the exercise price and the fair value of our common stock for accounting purposes on the date that certain stock options were granted 
this amount is included as a component of stockholders equity and is being amortized on an accelerated basis by charges to operations over the vesting period of the options  consistent with the method described in financial accounting standards board interpretation no

operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses  which are expensed as incurred  consist primarily of salaries and related costs of our engineering organization  fees paid to third party consultants and an allocation of our facilities and depreciation expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million and decreased to million in from million in the increase in was due to a million increase in personnel and related costs and million in third party consultant costs primarily due to the costs associated with completing various components and enhancing the capabilities of retek  as well as an increase in facilities costs due to our move to our new corporate facilities 
these increases were offset by a decrease in amortization of stock based compensation 
the decrease in total research and development for is primarily due to a million decrease in amortization of stock based compensation and a million decrease in third party consulting costs  which was offset by a million increase in occupancy allocation 
we expect the absolute dollar of expenditures in research and development to decrease due to our restructuring plan that was initiated in the fourth quarter  primarily due to the decrease in the number of employees and also due to a reduction in rates negotiated with certain third party consultants 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs of our sales and marketing organization  sales commissions  costs of our marketing programs  including public relations  advertising  trade shows  collateral sales materials  our customer user reference group program  rent and facilities costs associated with our regional and international sales offices and an allocation of our facilities and depreciation expenses 
sales and marketing expense decreased to million in and increased to million in from million in the decrease in was due to a million decrease in personnel and related expenses and million decrease in marketing programs

the increase in sales and marketing costs in were due to the expansion of our sales and marketing functions necessary to support the introduction of several new product offerings

impairment of intangible asset 
the impairment of intangible assets relates to the intangible asset from henderson 
because our relationship with henderson has not generated software sales for us to date and because of the increasing uncertainty about retailers future capital investments and other factors  we determined that an evaluation of the recoverability of the intangible asset related to henderson was appropriate 
as a result  we determined that no significant future cash flows are probable from our relationship with henderson and the net book value of the intangible asset related to the software development and distribution agreement of million was impaired and was written off during the third quarter of acquired in process research and development 
in connection with our acquisition of hightouch technologies  inc in may  acquired in process research and development of million was charged to results of operation on the acquisition date 
the classification of the technology as complete or under development was made in accordance with the guidelines of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 statement of financial accounting standards no 
and financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
prior to our acquisition  hightouch primarily sold customized software and services to a variety of customers in the retail industry 
at the time of acquisition  hightouch had technology under development relating to the creation of the company s first fully integrated standardized off the shelf crm product 
this in process research and development project achieved technological feasibility in products classified as under development subsequently achieved technological feasibility 
we used an independent appraisal firm to assist in the valuation of the fair market value of the purchased assets of hightouch 
fair market value is defined as the estimated amount at which an asset might be expected to be exchanged for between a willing buyer and willing seller assuming the buyer continues to use the assets in its current operations 
we provided assumptions by product line of revenue  cost of goods sold and operating expense to the appraiser to assist in the valuation 
these projections were made based on an assessment of customer needs and the expected pricing and cost structure 
the in process research and development projects were valued through the use of a discounted cash flow analysis  taking into account projected future cash flows associated with these projects once they achieve technological feasibility  their stage of completion as of the acquisition date  and the expected return requirements ie discount rate for present valuing of the projected cash flows 
stage of completion was estimated by considering time  cost  and complexity of tasks completed prior to the acquisition as a percentage of total time  cost and effort required for the total project up to achieving technological feasibility 
with respect to the discount rates used in the valuation approach  the incomplete technology represents a mix of near and mid term prospects for the business and imparts a level of uncertainty to its prospects 
a reasonable expectation of return on the incomplete technology would be higher than that of completed technology due to these inherent risks 
as a result  the earnings associated with incomplete technology were discounted at a rate of for hightouch based upon the following methodology the capital asset pricing model was used to determine the cost of equity 
it combines a risk free rate of return with an equity risk premium multiplied by a factor  referred to as beta  which is based on the performance of common stock prices of similar publicly traded companies 
employing these data  the discount rate attributable to the business was  which was used for valuing completed technology 
since incomplete technology would require a higher return than completed technology  the valuation report prepared by our appraiser used a rate of to present value cash flows in excess of a return on other assets of the business attributable to in process research and development projects 
acquisition related amortization of intangibles 
in connection with our purchase of hightouch in  the application of the purchase method of accounting for the acquisition resulted in an excess of cost over net assets acquired of million  of which million was allocated to intangibles and million was allocated to in process research and development 
in conjunction with the purchase  we recorded various intangible assets  which are being amortized over estimated useful lives ranging from three to five years 
in connection with the purchase of webtrak in  the application of the purchase method of accounting for the acquisition resulted in an excess of cost over net assets acquired of million  of which million was allocated to intangibles and million was allocated to in process research and development 
in conjunction with the purchase  we recorded various intangible assets  which are being amortized over estimated useful lives ranging from three to five years 
restructuring and other in the fourth quarter of  we began implementation of a restructuring plan intended to bring our operating expenses in line with expected revenues due to concerns with a weakening global economy and decreasing capital expenditures by retailers 
actions taken included a reduction of our workforce and a reduction in the amount of leased space 
the restructuring plan includes workforce reductions of employees across most business functions and geographic regions and all employees were notified in of benefits to be received 
we recorded a charge for severance and related benefits of million of which we have paid million 
as of december   of these employees have been separated 
the remainder will be separated through the third quarter of we also recorded a net loss on lease abandonment of million in the fourth quarter of this lease abandonment loss consists of the payments to be made for the remaining lease term of the abandoned space that aggregates million  net of estimated sublease income of million 
the lease terms on the leased space to be abandoned ranges from five to eleven years 
management has made its best estimates of expected sublease income over the abandoned leases remaining term 
the estimated sub lease income amount is highly judgmental and includes assumptions regarding the periods of sublease and the price per square foot to paid by the sublessors 
our plan calls for the affected space to be abandoned by us at various dates through the third quarter of as required by the applicable accounting standards  we will review these estimates each quarter and make adjustments  as necessary  to reflect management s best estimates 
the following table sets forth a summary of the restructuring charges  payment made against those charges and the remaining liabilities as of december  balance as of restructuring dec 
 charges cash usage lease obligations and terminations severance and related benefits total related to the lease abandonment charge  we recorded million of accelerated depreciation on abandoned fixed assets in the year ended december   which is recorded as general and administrative expense 
as a result of these charges we estimate savings of million in depreciation expense in interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net increased to million in from million in and million in the increase in other income in and was due to an increase in interest income  which was partially offset by interest expense related to notes payable 
income tax provision benefit 
the income tax provision was million in compared to an income tax benefit of million and million in and  respectively 
during the third quarter of  we determined that it was appropriate to record a full valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets 
the establishment of a full deferred tax valuation allowance was determined to be appropriate in light of the magnitude of our revenue decrease  our operating losses  our expectation of significant loss for the full year and the added uncertainty of the market in which we operate 
this full valuation allowance resulted in an increase to the income tax provision of million for despite the full valuation allowance  the income tax benefits related to these deferred tax assets will remain available to offset future taxable income 
we expect to record a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until we can sustain an appropriate level of profitability and until such time  we would not expect to recognize any significant tax benefits in our future results of operations 
prior to  the tax amounts were based on management s estimates of the effective tax rates to be incurred by us during those respective full years 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our cash  cash equivalents and investment balance was million 
net cash used by operating activities was million in and net cash provided by operating activities was million and million in and  respectively 
uses of cash in were due to an operating loss adjusted to exclude non cash charges and increases in accounts receivable  and decreases in accrued liabilities and deferred revenue 
sources of cash in  which offset our net loss and an increase in accounts receivable  were depreciation and amortization  increases to the provision for doubtful accounts  amortization of stock based compensation and increases in deferred revenue 
sources of cash in  which offset our net loss and increases in certain assets  were depreciation and amortization  increases to the provision for doubtful accounts  amortization of stock based compensation and acquired in process research and development  increases in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and deferred revenue 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  uses of cash were due to the acquisition of property and equipment  purchases of investments available for sale  and cash paid for substantially all of the technology of chelsea 
in  uses of cash were due to the acquisition of property and equipment and purchases of investments available for sale  which was partially offset by the sale of investments available for sale 
the increase in purchases of investments was due to our investing cash in higher yielding investments 
we purchased investments designed to protect our capital investment 
we purchase primarily short term investments that have a low risk of capital loss  such as us government securities  major corporation commercial paper  money market securities and tax exempt municipal securities 
in  uses of cash were due to the acquisition of property and equipment  purchases of investments available for sale and cash paid for the hightouch acquisition  which was partially offset by cash purchased in the acquisition 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in and million in net cash used by financing activities was million in net cash provided by financing activities in and were due to the issuance of common stock for employee stock option exercises and stock plan purchases 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
operating cash flows would be negatively impacted if we were unable to sign new customer contracts or if a significant number of customers were unable to pay for our solutions and services 
consumer spending  consumer confidence and other economic measures in the us economy impact our customer base in the retail industry and negative trends in these measures may impact the amount and type of capital expenditures made by them 
management intends to invest our cash in excess of current operating requirements in short term  interest bearing  investment grade securities 
a portion of our cash could also be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or otherwise to obtain the right to use complementary technologies or data 
we regularly evaluate  in the ordinary course of business  potential acquisitions of such businesses  products  technologies or data 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations  including purchase commitments at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods dollars in thousands 
after contractual obligations operating leases notes payable total contractual cash obligations after other commercial commitments standby letters of credit total contractual cash obligations as of december   there were no balances drawn against the line of credit or standby letters of credit 
we have commitments with our strategic alliance partners  ibm and accenture  whereby upon achieving certain revenue targets we may be obligated to issue shares and to make payments as outlined in footnotes and to the consolidated financial statements 
factors that may impact future results of operations and market price of our common stock an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
investors evaluating us and our business should carefully consider the factors described below and all other information contained in this annual report on form k before purchasing our common stock 
any of the following factors could materially harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
additional factors and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial could also harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
investors could lose all or part of their investment as a result of these factors 
as defined in the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  except for the historical information contained herein  some of the matters discussed in this annual report on form k contain forward looking statements regarding future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
the following factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those described by such statements 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future 
if our quarterly operating results fail to meet expectations  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
in addition  significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may harm our business operations by making it difficult to implement our budget and business plan 
factors  many of which are outside of our control  which could cause our operating results to fluctuate include the size and timing of customer orders  which can be affected by customer budgeting and purchasing cycles  the demand for and market acceptance of our software solutions  competitors announcements or introductions of new software solutions  services or technological innovations  our ability to develop  introduce and market new products on a timely basis  customer deferral of material orders in anticipation of new releases or new product introductions  our success in expanding our sales and marketing programs  technological changes or problems in computer systems  general economic conditions which may affect our customers capital investment levels  and our ability to reduce expense levels if our revenues decline and our ability to implement our restructuring plan 
we currently derive a significant portion of our license revenue in each quarter from a small number of relatively large orders  and we generally recognize revenue from our licenses over the related technical advisory services period 
if we are unable to recognize revenue from one or more substantial license sales for a particular fiscal quarter  our operating results for that quarter would be seriously harmed and our visibility for revenue deferred into future quarters would be reduced 
in addition  the license of our products typically involves a substantial commitment of resources by our customers or their consultants over an extended period of time 
the time required to complete an implementation may vary from customer to customer and may be protracted due to unforeseen circumstances 
because our revenues from implementation  maintenance and training services are largely correlated with our license revenue  a decline in license revenue would also cause a decline in our services revenue in the same quarter and in subsequent quarters 
because our sales cycle is long  we may have difficulty predicting when we will recognize revenue 
if our quarterly revenue or operating results fall below expectations  the price of our common stock could fall substantially and we could become subject to additional securities class action litigation 
litigation  if instituted  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  our reporting period operating results would also be impacted if our customers did not purchase technical advisory support with our software solutions 
with technical advisory support  revenues are recognized ratably over the advisory period  if all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
without the advisory services  revenues would be recognized when we execute the license agreement or contract  deliver the software  determine that collections of the proceeds is probable  and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate revenue to undelivered elements of the arrangement 
using these criteria  rather than our current revenue recognition policy with advisory services  could materially impact period over period results in our consolidated financial statements 
we have incurred  and will continue to incur  compensation expense in connection with our grants of options under our equity incentive plan  our hightouch technologies  inc stock option plan and our directors stock option plan 
this expense will be amortized over the vesting period of these granted options  which is generally four years  resulting in lower quarterly income 
our quarterly expense levels are relatively fixed and are based  in part  on expectations as to future revenue 
as a result  if revenue levels fall below our expectations  net income will decrease because only a small portion of our expenses varies with our revenue 
in the fourth quarter  we recorded restructuring charges and enacted certain cost reduction measures in response to the downturn in our financial results 
if our restructuring plans and our cost reduction measures fail to achieve the desired results or result in unanticipated negative consequences  we may suffer material harm to our business 
in response to the recent downturn in our financial performance  we implemented restructuring plans and cost reduction measures to reduce our cost structure  which included workforce and facilities reductions 
our cost reduction measures may yield unanticipated consequences  such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce  reduced employee morale and decreased productivity  and may result in incidental employment related litigation 
the workforce reductions impacted employees directly responsible for sales and research and development  which may affect our ability to close revenue transactions with our customers and potential customers and may affect our ability to finish development efforts on a timely basis 
further  sales force reductions will require an increase in sales resource productivity in order for us to achieve revenue projections 
the failure to retain and effectively manage our remaining employees could increase our costs  hurt our development efforts and impact the quality of our customer service and products 
failure to achieve the desired results of our strategic initiatives or sufficiently reduce our workforce would harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if our current products are not continued to be accepted or we do not respond adequately to our industry s rapid pace of change  sales of our products may decline 
our business depends on the successful customer acceptance of our products and we expect that we will continue to depend on revenue from existing  new and enhanced versions of our products 
in addition  our business would be harmed if our target customers do not adopt and or expand their use of our products 
in addition  potential customers are more deliberately evaluating solutions  which resulted in extended sales cycles in if we are unable to develop new software solutions or enhancements to our existing products on a timely and cost effective basis  or if new products or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance  our sales may decline 
the life cycles of our products are difficult to predict because the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change and changing customer needs 
the introduction of products employing new technologies could render our existing products or services obsolete and unmarketable 
in developing new products and services  we may fail to respond to technological changes in a timely or cost effective manner  encounter products  capabilities or technologies developed by others that render our products and services obsolete or noncompetitive or that shorten the life cycles of our existing products and services  experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of these new products and services  or fail to achieve market acceptance of our products and services 
if we fail to establish  maintain and expand our relationships with third parties who implement our products  our ability to meet our customers needs could be harmed 
we rely  and expect to continue to rely  on a number of third parties to implement our software solutions at customer sites 
if we are unable to establish and maintain effective  long term relationships with these implementation providers  or if these providers do not meet the needs or expectations of our customers  our revenue will be reduced and our customer relationships will be harmed 
our current implementation partners are not contractually required to continue to help implement our software solutions 
our software products perform or directly affect mission critical functions across many different functional and geographic areas of the enterprise 
implementation of our software solutions can be a lengthy process 
we may be unable to establish or maintain relationships with third parties having sufficient qualified personnel resources to provide the necessary implementation services to support our needs 
if third party services are unavailable  we will be required to provide these services internally  which would significantly limit our ability to meet customers implementation needs and would increase our operating expenses and could reduce gross margins 
a number of our competitors have significantly more established relationships with these third parties and  as a result  these third parties may be more likely to recommend competitors products and services rather than our own 
in addition  we cannot control the level and quality of service provided by our current and future implementation partners 
significant issues implementing our solutions could result in client dissatisfaction and could therefore cause delays or prevent us from collecting fees from our customers and could damage our ability to attract new customers 
we have been named a defendant in securities class action litigation and derivative actions and we may in the future be named in additional litigation  which may result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
as described in part i item legal proceedings  a number of shareholder class action suits have been filed naming the company and or certain of our current and former officers and directors as co defendants 
two additional related derivative action suits have been filed on our behalf naming certain of our officers and directors 
we believe these claims are subject to a variety of meritorious defenses  which we intend to vigorously pursue 
however  it is possible that the litigation could be resolved adversely  could result in substantial costs and could divert management s attention and resources  which could seriously harm our business 
more generally  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following declines in the market price of its securities 
this risk is greater for technology companies  which have experienced greater than average stock price declines in recent years and  as a result  have been subject to  on average  a greater number of securities class action claims than companies in other industries 
while we maintain director and officer insurance  the amount of insurance coverage may not be sufficient for any such claim and the continued availability of such insurance cannot be assured 
we may in the future be the target of this kind of litigation and such litigation could also result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel  our ability to grow our business could be harmed 
we believe that our future success will depend significantly upon our ability to attract  integrate  motivate and retain skilled sales  research and development  marketing and management personnel 
competition for skilled personnel is intense and the software industry is characterized by a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting of skilled personnel 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting  retaining and motivating the personnel required to grow and operate profitably 
failure to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel would adversely affect our business 
the recent trading levels of our stock have decreased the value of our stock options granted to employees under our stock option plans 
as a result of these factors  our remaining personnel may seek alternate employment  such as with larger  more established companies or companies that they perceive as having less volatile stock prices 
continuity of personnel can be a very important factor in sales and implementation of our software and completion of our product development efforts 
attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
competitive pressures could reduce our market share or require us to reduce our prices  which would reduce our revenue and or operating margins 
the market for our software solutions is highly competitive and subject to rapidly changing technology 
competition could seriously impede our ability to sell products and services on terms favorable to us 
competitive pressures could reduce our market share or require us to reduce prices  which would reduce our revenues and or operating margins 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  development or other resources  and greater name recognition than us 
in addition  these companies may adopt aggressive pricing policies that could compel us to reduce the prices of our products and services in response 
our competitors may also be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
our current and potential competitors may develop and market new technologies that render our existing or future products obsolete  unmarketable or less competitive  make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with other solution providers  which would increase the ability of their products to address the needs of our customers  and establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future strategic partners  which would limit our ability to sell products through these channels 
as a result  we may not be able to maintain a competitive position against current or future competitors 
a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from the retail industry 
we have in the past derived substantially all of our revenues from the license of our software products and the delivery of related service to retail customers 
our future growth and profitability is dependent upon increased sales to retailers 
recent world wide economic conditions and competitive pressures in the retail industry could negatively impact demand for our products and services 
such competitive pressures and softness of economic conditions could cause retail customers and potential customers to delay  cancel or reduce their information technology budgets and their spending on our software products and services 
if we fail to obtain access to the intellectual property of third parties  our business and operating results could be harmed 
we must now  and may in the future have to  license or otherwise obtain access to the intellectual property of third parties  including hnc software  microstrategy  seebeyond  sun  ibm  accenture and oracle 
our business would be seriously harmed if the providers from whom we license such software cease to deliver and support reliable products or enhance their current products 
in addition  the third party software may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or prices or at all 
our inability to maintain or obtain this software could result in shipment delays or reduced sales of our products 
furthermore  we might be forced to limit the features available in our current or future product offerings 
either alternative could seriously harm business and operating results 
if our intellectual property is not adequately protected  our competitors may gain access to our technology and we may lose customers 
we depend on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology 
to protect proprietary technology  we rely primarily on a combination of contractual provisions  confidentiality procedures  trade secrets  and copyright and trademark laws 
we seek to protect our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and expensive  and while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists  software piracy may be a problem 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
we intend to vigorously protect intellectual property rights through litigation and other means 
however  such litigation can be costly to prosecute and we cannot be certain that we will be able to enforce our rights or prevent other parties from developing similar technology  duplicating our products or designing around our intellectual property 
if  in the future  third parties claim that our products infringe on their intellectual property  we may incur significant costs 
there has been a substantial amount of litigation in the software industry and the internet industry regarding intellectual property rights 
it is possible that in the future third parties may claim that our current or potential future products infringe their intellectual property 
we expect that software product developers and providers of electronic commerce solutions will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grow and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlap 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all  which could seriously harm our business and expose us to claims by our customers 
our business is subject to economic  political and other risks associated with international sales 
since we sell products worldwide  our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
to the extent that our sales are denominated in foreign currencies  the revenue we receive could be subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
if the effective price of the products we sell to our customers were to increase due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  demand for our technology could fall  which would  in turn  reduce our revenue 
we have not historically attempted to mitigate the effect that currency fluctuations may have on our revenue through use of hedging instruments  and we do not currently intend to do so in the future 
we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue 
accordingly  our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  greater risk of uncollectable accounts and longer accounts receivable payment cycles  changes in a specific country s or region s political  legal or economic conditions  particularly in emerging markets  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws or other localization legal requirements  cost of and difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and foreign language skill limitations  international variations in technology standards  differing levels of protection of intellectual property  and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
continued terrorist attacks or war could lead to further economic instability which could harm our business 
terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred in new york  pennsylvania and washington  dc  on september   and current and future war risks may adversely affect our business  results of operation  financial condition or future growth 
the united states has made strong overtures of going to war with iraq 
terrorist attacks and potential war in the middle east may lead to additional armed hostilities or to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbance in the united states or elsewhere  which may further contribute to economic instability and could adversely affect economic conditions  particularly in the retail industry 
errors and defects in our products could result in significant costs to us and could impair our ability to sell our products 
our products are complex and  accordingly  may contain undetected errors or failures when we first introduce them or as we release new versions 
this may result in loss of  or delay in  market acceptance of our products and could cause us to incur significant costs to correct errors or failures or to pay damages suffered by customers as a result of such errors or failures 
in the past  we have discovered software errors in new releases and new products after their introduction 
we have incurred costs during the period required to correct these errors  although to date such costs  including costs incurred on specific contracts  have not been material 
we may in the future discover errors in new releases or new products after the commencement of commercial shipments 
recent accounting pronouncements on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  in its entirety 
this statement addresses accounting and financial reporting for goodwill and intangible assets 
under the new statement  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but are subject to impairment testing on at least an annual basis 
other than goodwill  we have no intangible assets with indefinite lives 
adoption of this statement resulted in no goodwill impairment losses and had no impact on our financial position as of january  in addition  the remaining useful lives of amortizable intangible assets were reviewed and deemed appropriate 
the following information reflects our results of operations as they would have appeared had we not recorded goodwill amortization expense and its related tax effects during and dollars in thousands  except per share amounts 
net loss  as reported add goodwill amortization expense  net of tax pro forma net loss loss per share basic and diluted as reported basic and diluted pro forma in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for exit or disposal activities 
sfas addresses significant issues regarding the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for under eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the scope of sfas also includes costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease and termination benefits that employees who are involuntarily terminated receive under the terms of a one time benefit arrangement that is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the provisions of eitf no 
shall continue to apply for an exit activity initiated under an exit plan that met the criteria of eitf no 
prior to the adoption of sfas adopting the provisions of sfas will change  on a prospective basis  the timing of when restructuring charges are recorded from a commitment date approach to when the liability is incurred 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures required in financial statements concerning obligations under certain guarantees 
it also clarifies the requirements related to the recognition of liabilities by a guarantor at the inception of certain guarantees 
we adopted the disclosure requirements of this interpretation on december  the recognition provisions of the interpretation are applicable only to guarantees issued or modified after december  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
this statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation  as outlined in sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement also amends the financial statement disclosure requirements relating to stock based compensation 
we currently have no plans to adopt the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation 
item a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 
interest rate risk the fair value of our cash  cash equivalents and investments available for sale at december  was million 
the objectives of our investment policy are safety and preservation of invested funds and liquidity of investments that is sufficient to meet cash flow requirements 
our policy is to place our cash  cash equivalents and investments available for sale with high credit quality financial institutions  commercial companies and government agencies in order to limit the amount of credit exposure 
it is also our policy to maintain certain concentration limits and to invest only in certain allowable securities as determined by our management 
our investment policy also provides that our investment portfolio must not have an average portfolio maturity of beyond one year 
investments are prohibited in certain industries and speculative activities 
investments must be denominated in us dollars 
an increase in market interest rates would not materially affect our financial results as our million in notes payable as of december  are at a fixed interest rate 
expected maturity date total fair value us in thousands liabilities long term debt average interest rate foreign currency exchange rate risk we develop products in the united states and sell in north america  asia and europe 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by various factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
our foreign currency risks are mitigated principally by contracting primarily in us dollars and maintaining only nominal foreign currency cash balances 
working funds necessary to facilitate the short term operations of our subsidiaries are kept in local currencies in which they do business  with excess funds transferred to our offices in the united states 
approximately   and of our total sales were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in  and  respectively 
equity price risk we own several investments in the common stock of certain companies that we have entered into for strategic business purposes 
as of december  we had substantially written off all of the value associated with our equity investments
