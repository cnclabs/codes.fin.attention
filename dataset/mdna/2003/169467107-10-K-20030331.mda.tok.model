in particular  in the recent year  the company had less service contract revenues  which carry higher margins  than in the prior year 
service contract revenues in hong kong were down significantly because of the downturn in the economy there 
the company anticipates that service contract revenues will not return to previous levels 
in addition  competitive factors such as the timing and composition of major tenders  as well as the ongoing competitive pricing pressures due to chinese government tendering regulations in the sale of capital medical equipment in the year yielded lower margins on such sales 
finally  gross margins on loan project sales are generally lower than on t he company s other sales because the company is not required to provide warranty service on many of the products sold through the loan programs

in  the company treated these two as one segment and thus  comparable information is not available and it would be impracticable to compare the two years on the basis of the segmentation in effect in if the company had not separated the two segments  the prior healthcare products segment  which was a combination of the capital medical equipment segment and the healthcare products distribution segment  would have reported revenue of  in as compared to  in gross profit would have been  in as compared to  in as a percentage of revenues the old segment would have reported in as compared to in expenses would have increased to  in as compared to  in healthcare services segment for  the revenues from this segment were  an increase of over revenues of  income from operations in was  as compared to  in during the recent period  beijing united continued to expand the services offered  which contributed to increased patient visits as well as increased inpatient stays over the prior year

minority interest the company s agreement with its joint venture partner for beijing united calls for the partner to receive of the profits of the hospital 
in  this minority interest in the net local income of beijing united amounted to  as compared to  for this income is directly related to the local entity profitability of the hospital 
the company also recorded a  start up loss on its investment in a joint venture in hong kong

other income and expenses other expense other than interest in was  compared to other income other than interest of  for the prior period other income was derived substantially from the sublease of space in the facility housing beijing united that ended on december  the part of the building that was subleased has now been renovated as part of the hospital expansion 
although the company did not anticipate any sublease revenues in  it does anticipate that now that the space is renovated and in service for beijing united  the company will recognize additional revenues through the expanded operations of beijing united  which may offset part or all of the loss of income from the sublease 
taxes the company recorded a  benefit from taxes in as compared to a benefit for taxes of  in this tax computation is in accordance with current accounting standards but assumes a certain level of future profitability 
the company believes this properly recognizes the benefits the company has achieved as a result of its tax restructuring and short term anticipation of future income tax loss carryforward utilization 
as a result of this restructuring the company expects to make use of a portion of its us federal net operating losses and accordingly  recorded a  deferred tax valuation adjustment in addition to last years  recorded on previously fully reserved tax losses 
the company expects these net operating losses to be recognizable in to fiscal year compared to the company s revenues for were  up from revenues of  these amounts include bulk medical equipment sales of  in and  in  due to sales attributable to shipments made under the company s loan financing transactions 
the company believes that this type of financing is important to its customers and the company and will continue to try to offer such financings in the future 
these financings can be very complex and their impact and timing on the company s results are difficult to predict see timing of revenues 
the company recorded net income in of  or a decrease from net income of  healthcare products the following comparison on healthcare products includes the products now contained in two segments  the capital medical equipment segment and the healthcare products distribution segment 
in  the company treated these two as one segment and thus  comparable information is not available and it would be impracticable to compare the two years on the basis of the segmentation in effect in the healthcare products segment  consisting of medical equipment  medical consumables and personal healthcare products  had revenue growth of to  in from revenues of  the revenues included  in sales of medical equipment and  in sales of medical consumables and personal healthcare products 
in  the sales of medical equipment constituted of the total for healthcare product sales  while the sales of medical consumables and personal healthcare products constituted of the total

other income other than interest increased slightly in to  from  in this other income is primarily from the net sublease income 
this sublease ended december  and this part of the building is now being renovated as part of the hospital expansion 
the company does not anticipate any significant revenue in this category in taxes the company has undertaken a global restructuring in which it has reorganized its structure and is modifying inter company relationships to better accommodate its predominantly chinese operations 
this restructuring was motivated  in part  by the company s desire to incorporate various functions previously operated as a division or branch of the us parent and  in part  due to its intent to expand its presence in the direct health care market by opening an additional hospital 
this restructuring provides the flexibility to structure operations in the people s republic of china to comply with the various legal and regulatory restrictions and encourages cash flow among the foreign subsidiaries to new investments without triggering us federal income tax 
this flexibility further permits the company to aggressively pursue chinese and other tax incentives  rebates  and holidays without triggering us federal income tax 
in addition  the new legal structure creates a desirable environment should the company wish to attract third party investment in a new chinese hospital or the chinese hospitals as a whole 
as such  this reorganization aligns the us tax result with the company s overall business plan and facilitates the free flow of cash among the company s foreign subsidiaries 
as a result of this restructuring the company expects to make use of a portion of its us federal net operating losses and accordingly  recorded a  deferred tax valuation adjustment on previously fully reserved tax losses 
the company expects these net operating losses to be recognizable in or nbsp  liquidity and capital resources as of december   total accounts receivable increased by  as compared to december  this was primarily due to the large loan project transaction shipping at the end of while no large loan transaction shipped during the last half of the year ended december  substantially all of the  increase as of december  in accounts payable and accrued expenses was related to vendor payments for the loan project shipped at the end payments related to this shipment are expected to be paid during as of december   inventories were  increasing  from the december  balance of  this increase was due to expansion of the healthcare products distribution network and pending capital medical equipment loan shipments awaiting final shipping instructions 
as of december  the company capitalized  of improvements and equipment  primarily for the expansion of beijing united into the two remaining floors previously sub leased 
the company is currently renovating and outfitting its hospital facility in shanghai  which is being primarily financed through vendor financing and local bank borrowings 
the company has signed an agreement with a major supplier whereby the supplier has agreed to provide long term one and one half years on transactions to date payment terms on the company s purchases of medical equipment from the supplier 
the arrangement carries an interest component of five percent 
due to this vendor financing the company has recorded long term accounts payable of  as of december  as of december   letters of credit issued by the company s principal bank  allfirst  amounted to approximately  and  were outstanding under the line of credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at over three month london interbank offered rate libor 
beijing united has completed short term financing arrangements in china with hongkong shanghai banking corp 
hsbc for up to  in revolving loans or standby credit 
terms of the agreement are customary  with the interest rate being over the month singapore interbank money market offer rate sibor 
beijing united has agreed to utilize hsbc for a certain portion of its credit card settlement business 
as of december  this line of credit was full utilized 
the following table sets forth the company s contractual cash obligations as of december  nbsp  nbsp  total thereafter line of credit vendor financing operating leases total contractual cash obligations for information about these contractual cash obligations  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
the company continues to consider various other financing alternatives to satisfy its future expansion  capital improvements and equipment requirements 
timing of revenues the timing of the company s revenues is affected by several significant factors 
many end users of the capital equipment products sold by the company depend to a certain extent upon the allocation of funds in the budgeting processes of the chinese government and the availability of credit from the chinese banking system 
these processes and the availability of credit are based on policy determinations by the chinese government and are not necessarily subject to fixed time schedules 
in addition  the sales of certain products often require protracted sales efforts  long lead times and other time consuming steps 
further  in light of the dependence by purchasers of capital equipment on the availability of credit  the timing of sales may depend upon the timing of the company s or its purchasers abilities to arrange for credit sources  including ex im bank or other loan financing 
as a result  the company s operating results have varied and are expected to continue to vary from period to period and year to year 
in addition  a relatively limited number of orders and shipments may constitute a meaningful percentage of the company s revenue in any one period 
as a result  a relatively small reduction in the number of orders can have a material impact on the company s revenues in any year 
further  because the company recognizes revenues and expenses as products are shipped  the timing of shipments could affect the company s operating results for a particular period 
at the same time  a g rowing percentage of the company s revenues are attributable to hospital services and local currency sales through the hpd  both of which have more even revenue streams 
nbsp  foreign currency exchange and impact of inflation the results of operations of the company for the periods discussed have not been significantly affected by inflation or foreign currency fluctuation 
since the company receives over of its revenues in local chinese currency  the company has some foreign currency risk 
changes in the valuation of the chinese renminbi or hong kong dollar may have an impact on the company s results of operations in the future 
the company s subsidiaries  chindex tianjin  chindex shanghai and beijing united  sell products and services in renminbi 
the company has also purchased and will continue to purchase some products in western currencies other than us dollars and has sold and will continue to sell such products in china for us dollars 
to the extent that the value of the us dollar declines against such a currency  the company could experience a negative impact on profitability 
the company anticipates hedging transactions wherever possible to minimize such negative impacts 
currently there are no such hedges 
nbsp  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks in a variety of ways 
the principal market risk is related to the nature of the chinese economy and political system 
since the company generates all of its revenues from china  any risk having to do with the environment in china for a foreign business operating there can have a significant impact on the company 
the chindex growth plan includes continuing expansion of the capital medical equipment business  rapid expansion of the hpd product portfolio  with an emphasis on increasing the number and variety of products that are sold directly to retail pharmacies  and the development of a network of private family hospitals  based on the beijing united model  to serve china s growing middle class 
management continues to develop this growth plan  the implementation of which will be contingent on a number of factors  including requisite financing 
although the company remains optimistic about the marketplace  there are continuing uncertainties as to the direction of china s on going political and economic reforms  the possibility for future devaluation of the chinese or hong kong currencies  and china s relationship with the united states 
these uncertainties may influence the budgeting and purchasing process in china 
any of the foregoing circumstances may impede trade with china  thus impairing the ability of the company s customers to purchase the company s products 
in the company s view  china s entry into the world trade organization in has made the dangers from these uncertainties less significant 
other possibly adverse circumstances include a decrease in the funds available for chinese end users as a result of a general economic slowdown  and increased competition from other american and european companies 
internal political risk the company s interests may be adversely affected by the political environment in china 
china is a socialist state which since has been  and is expected to continue to be  controlled by the communist party of china 
changes in the top political leadership of the chinese government and or the communist party  may have a significant impact on policy and the political and economic environment in china 
moreover  economic reforms and growth have been more successful in certain sections of the country than others  and the continuation or increase of such disparities could affect political or social stability 
government control over economy the government of china has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every section of the chinese economy through regulation and state ownership 
china s continued commitment to reform and the development of a vital private sector in that country have  to some extent  limited the practical effects of the control currently exercised by the government over individual business enterprises 
however  the economy continues to be subject to significant government controls which  if directed towards business activities of the company  could have a significant adverse impact on the company 
for example  if the government were to limit the number of foreign personnel who could work in the country  or were to substantially increase taxes on foreign businesses or were to impose any number of other possible types of limitations on the company s operations  the impact would be significant 
legal system china s legal system is a civil law system  which is based on written statutes and in which decided legal cases have little precedential value 
moreover  china s legal system is still in the early stage of development and there are not sufficient numbers of trained judges or other legal professionals to manage disputes that may arise 
as a result  the administration of laws and regulations by government agencies in china may be subject to considerable discretion 
foreign trade corporations in the sale of its capital equipment to china  the company must make most of its sales through foreign trade corporations ftcs 
although purchasing decisions are made by the end user  which is obligated to pay the applicable purchase prices  the company enters into a formal purchase contract with only the ftc 
by virtue of its direct contractual relationship with the ftc  rather than the end user  the company is to some extent dependent upon the continuing existence of and contractual compliance by the ftc until the particular transaction has been completed
