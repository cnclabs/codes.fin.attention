item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview ace comm derives revenues primarily from the sale of its products  including hardware and software  and related services 
ace comm enters into formal arrangements that provide for single or multiple deliverables of hardware  software and services 
these arrangements are formalized by either a simple purchase order or by more complex contracts such as development  reseller or master agreements 
these arrangements are generally us dollar denominated and typically have an aggregate value of several thousand to several million dollars and vary in length from days to several years  as in the case of master agreements 
agreements spanning several years are normally implemented in smaller statements of work or orders that are typically deliverable within three to twelve months 
when an agreement provides for significant modification or customization of software  or when ace comm s system integration and product development are essential to the functionality of the software  revenues related to the software licenses and services are aggregated and the combined revenues are recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method is based on the estimated stage of completion of individual contracts determined on a cost or level of efforts basis 
any hardware or post contract customer support provided for under the terms of the agreement is unbundled 
hardware revenue is recognized upon delivery  which usually occurs upon transfer of title  and post contract customer support is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
most of ace comm s professional services are delivered in conjunction with ace comm s solutions and are sometimes essential to the functionality of other elements of the arrangement 
however  ace comm does sell unbundled services  and  in these instances  ace comm generally recognizes revenue as the services are performed 
more frequently  ace comm is entering into multiple element arrangements that do not involve significant modification or customization of the related software 
in these instances  ace comm allocates revenue to each element of the arrangement based on objective evidence of the element s fair value based on internal price listings developed by ace comm 
revenue for software licenses is recognized upon delivery  which usually occurs upon transfer of title  when a signed agreement exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
revenue for a given period typically reflects products delivered or services performed during the period with respect to relatively large financial commitments from a small number of customers 
during  ace comm had major customers  which ace comm defines as generating  or more in revenues  that together represented approximately of total revenues 
siemens ag  ace comm s largest customer in fiscal year  represented approximately of total revenues  and northrop grumman contributed approximately of total revenues 
during  ace comm had major customers representing of total revenues 
siemens ag represented approximately of total revenues and northrop grumman contributed of total revenues earned during during  ace comm had major customers representing of total revenues 
the average revenues earned per major customer were million in  million in and million in during the past three fiscal years  ace comm has experienced significant net losses from operations  primarily due to reduced demand from its north american telecommunications customers 
management expects this lower demand to continue in the foreseeable future 
to offset the effects of the current lower north american demand  ace comm continues to target sales efforts toward what it believes to be a growing market for its convergent mediation solutions outside of north america 
to date ace comm has experienced an increase in revenue from outside of north america  in particular china  but the increase has not been sufficient to offset the decline in revenues from the north american market 
ace comm has been and continues to be focused on streamlining the organization to meet its objectives  conserve cash and control expenses 
during the past three fiscal years the number of full time employees has been reduced by approximately 
this reduction was designed to reduce costs without materially impacting ace comm s ability to maintain its historical levels of customer involvement and technological innovation  especially in areas of focus such as china 
additionally  ace comm has significantly reduced other operating expenses such as rent  travel  consulting and professional fees 
the results of these cost reduction measures has been a significant decline in the amount of the losses sustained in each of the last three fiscal years 
recently  ace comm entered into an agreement and plan of merger with i mobile  inc under which ace comm has agreed to acquire i the acquisition is to be effected through the issuance of a to be determined number of shares of ace comm s common stock in exchange for each share of common stock of i mobile outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of the transaction 
the exchange ratio will be based on a formula valuing ace comm s common stock at market value at the time of mailing of the proxy statement  less a discount  and valuing i mobile at an amount equal to its cash  net of specified liabilities and commitments at the mailing date 
the consummation of the transaction is subject to the approval of the shareholders of i mobile and ace comm  as well as customary closing conditions 
we expect the merger with i mobile  if consummated  to provide ace comm with significant cash resources to devote to internal development or acquisition of new technologies of complementary businesses 
we plan to continue pursuing new business opportunities in the form of acquisitions or alliances with other companies  although there can be no assurances as to the timing or effectiveness of any such arrangements 
these arrangements could include technology and marketing alliances driven by product development requirements and sales opportunities  as well as business combinations that would strengthen ace comm s product offerings and market potential 
critical accounting policies in december  the sec requested that all registrants include a discussion of its critical accounting policies 
ace comm s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to ace comm s consolidated financial statements 
however  certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations or require the application of significant judgment by our management 
the following is a brief discussion of these critical accounting policies revenue recognition ace comm derives revenues primarily from products  where a combination of hardware  proprietary licensed software  and services are offered to customers 
these products are typically formalized in a multiple element arrangement involving application of existing software capabilities or modification of the underlying software and implementation services 
ace comm s software licenses to end users generally provide for an initial license fee to use the product in perpetuity 
under certain contracts  ace comm licenses its software to resellers for subsequent application of existing software and resale 
our customers  including resellers  do not possess the right to return or exchange products 
more frequently  ace comm is entering into multiple element arrangements that do not involve significant modification or customization of the related software 
in these instances  ace comm recognizes revenue in accordance with aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  and allocates revenue to each element of the arrangement based on objective evidence of the element s fair value based on internal price listings developed by ace comm 
revenue for software licenses in these instances is recognized upon delivery ie  transfer of title  when a signed agreement exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
the amount allocated to ace comm s maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the respective maintenance period 
in situations when ace comm s products involve significant modification or customization of software  or when ace comm s systems integration and product development are essential to the functionality of the software  revenues relating to the software licenses and services are aggregated and the combined revenues are recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
the hardware revenue on these contracts is recognized upon transfer of title  which generally occurs at the same time the licensed software is delivered 
revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method is based on the estimated stage of completion of individual contracts determined on a cost or level of efforts basis 
our revenue recognition policy takes into consideration the creditworthiness of the customer in determining the probability of collection as a criterion for revenue recognition 
the determination of creditworthiness requires the exercise of judgment  which affects our revenue recognition 
if a customer is deemed to be not creditworthy  all revenue under arrangements with that customer is recognized only upon receipt of cash 
the creditworthiness of such customers is re assessed on a regular basis and revenue is deferred until cash is received 
allowance for bad debts the allowance for doubtful accounts is established through a charge to general and administrative expenses 
this allowance is for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
it is an estimate and is regularly evaluated by us for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer  age of the receivable balance  individually and in aggregate  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different allowance balances 
our customer base is highly concentrated in the telecommunications and internet service provider industries 
several of the leading companies in these industries have filed for bankruptcy 
if collection is not probable at the time the transaction is consummated  we do not recognize revenue until cash collection 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
results of operations the following sets forth selected consolidated data as a percentage of revenue for each of the following years ended june years ended june  revenue costs and expenses cost of revenue selling  general and administrative research and development income loss from operations net interest income expense income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss revenues total revenues in were million compared to million in and million in total revenues decreased million or in and million or in  in each case as compared to the prior year 
revenue growth depends  in part  on the overall demand for ace comm s products 
because ace comm s sales are primarily to telecommunication and internet service providers and enterprises  its ability to generate revenue also depends on specific conditions affecting those providers and their willingness to make significant expenditures to improve their data collection and processing 
the decrease in revenues over the past three years reflects the continuing weak general economic conditions and  more specifically  weak economic conditions in the domestic telecommunication and internet service provider markets and reduced willingness to make significant capital investments in improving their networks and data 
customers in this market often rely on the capital markets to meet their ongoing cash flow requirements and support their growth 
during  companies in this market continued to encounter reduced demand for their products and difficulty in accessing capital markets  resulting in the continuing reduction of their demand for ace comm s products 
in addition  several of ace comm s north american customers filed for bankruptcy during consequently  revenues from sales to telecommunication and internet service providers  representing approximately of total revenues  decreased to million in  as compared to the prior year 
revenues from sales to enterprises  representing approximately of total revenues  decreased to million in  as compared to the prior year 
the decline in sales to enterprises is primarily the result of the completion of large orders received in that were not replaced with new orders in our enterprise sales efforts have also been affected by the same weak economic conditions 
ace comm has experienced increased competition from telecommunication equipment manufacturers who are seeking to diversify sales from the telecommunications and internet service provider markets to the overall enterprise market 
during  service providers in the telecommunication and internet market continued to experience reduced demand for their products and difficulty in accessing capital markets and  as a result  ace comm experienced decreased demand for convergent mediation products 
revenues from sales to telecommunication and internet service providers representing approximately of total revenues decreased to million  as compared to the prior year 
also  revenues from sales to enterprises representing approximately of total revenues decreased to million in  as compared to the prior year 
cost of revenues ace comm s cost of revenue consists primarily of direct labor costs  direct material costs  and allocable indirect costs and to a lesser extent  amortized capitalized software development costs  and inventory obsolescence costs 
the expenses for services provided by certain alliance partners in connection with the installation and integration of ace comm s products may also be included 
cost of revenues were million in  million in and million in  representing   and of total revenues in each year  respectively 
cost of revenues decreased million or in  as compared to the prior year  reflecting a decrease in labor and labor related costs  as ace comm further decreased staffing levels in response to the continuing decline in demand for ace comm s products within the telecommunications sector 
cost of revenues decreased in reflecting a reduction in labor and labor related costs in response to unfavorable economic conditions and decline in demand 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist of costs to support ace comm s sales and administrative functions 
sales expenses consist primarily of salary  commission  travel  trade show  bid and proposal  and other related selling and marketing expenses required to sell our products to target markets 
general and administrative expenses consist of provision for doubtful accounts and unallocated costs related to information systems infrastructure  facilities  finance and accounting  legal  human resources and corporate management 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  million in  and million in  representing  and of total revenues in each year  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million or in and decreased million or in  as compared to each prior corresponding period 
the decrease in and is primarily the result of a continuing effort to reduce expenses  which includes company and employee initiated reductions in personnel  and reductions in rent  travel  consulting and professional fees 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of personnel costs and the associated infrastructure costs required to support the design and development of ace comm s products 
research and development expenses were million in compared to million in and million in research and development expenses decreased million or in and million or in  as compared to each prior corresponding period 
research and development expenses represented of revenues in  of revenues in  and of revenues in the decrease in research and development in and  over the prior corresponding periods  reflects a decrease in resources applied to research and development 
ace comm was selective in approving new projects and in some instances discontinued projects that were not related to the development of convergent mediation tm solutions 
in some instances ace comm charges its customers for development which it includes in cost of revenues 
based upon the uncertain north american market  ace comm decided to explore opportunities to license or acquire new technology from third parties as a strategy for expanding it s product offerings 
ace comm did not capitalize software development costs in  or in because ace comm s product development methodology generally establishes technological feasibility near the end of the development process 
provision for doubtful accounts ace comm recognized a net provision for doubtful accounts of million in  compared to a net provision for doubtful accounts of million in and of million in  representing a decrease of million in and of million in in each case as compared to the corresponding period of the prior year 
during  very few of ace comm s customers experienced negative financial impact to the extent which would require ace comm to provide extensively for their respective accounts which occurred in and  thereby resulting in significantly decreased bad debts for beginning in and continuing through  some of ace comm s telecommunication and internet service provider customers elected to reorganize under chapter of the bankruptcy code  were unable to obtain adequate financing  or were affected by unfavorable economic conditions in their respective markets 
the impact of these economic conditions on our customers  and in particular the bankruptcy filing by winstar  adversely affected ace comm s ability to collect outstanding accounts receivables  resulting in increased bad debts in and the provision for doubtful accounts associated with customers that filed for bankruptcy was million in and million for ace comm believes that these difficulties will not continue to be encountered with its current customers 
however  existing or future customers ability to pay ace comm may be adversely impacted by unfavorable economic conditions or by other factors 
liquidity and capital resources asset and cash flow analysis at june  ace comm s primary source of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of million  and also a million working capital line of credit

accounts receivables increased million  or to million at june  five customers represented of ace comm s gross trade receivables balance as of june   with one international customer representing of ace comm s gross trade receivables balance as of june  the increase in accounts receivable is primarily the result of an increase in international customers who traditionally have taken longer to pay and to an increase in instances where payments are scheduled over an extended period of time  in no case greater than one year 
ace comm s operating activities used million in cash during  used million in cash during  and generated cash of million in the changes between years in cash flows from operating activities are principally due to changes in net income loss after adjustments for non cash charges such as depreciation and changes in working capital amounts 
changes in accounts receivable balances are typically the most significant component of working capital and fluctuate as a result of the timing and volume of ace comm s revenues and other factors 
net cash used for investing activities was million  million  and million in   and  respectively  representing capital purchases of computer equipment 
ace comm s financing activities generated cash of million in  used cash of million in  and generated cash of million in ace comm had positive cash flows from financing activities in as a result of additional borrowings and net cash generated from a strategic partner acquiring  shares of ace comm s common stock
