item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the section selected financial data and the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
the information contained below may be subject to risk factors 
we urge you to review carefully the section factors affecting operating results in this report for a more complete discussion of the risks associated with an investment in our securities 
see special note on forward looking statements and risk factors above under item critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our revenue recognition  discontinued operations  deferred taxes  impairment of long lived assets  litigation and inventory 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition 
we expect to derive revenue primarily from sales of our hardware based security systems and appliances  and to a lesser extent  from software products and services 
we sell primarily to resellers  including value added resellers vars 
we recognized no net revenue during the fiscal year ended january  although we had limited sales during the period 
generally  we will recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
we do not expect resellers to hold significant inventories of our products  if at all 
as a result  we expect returns to be minimal 
we will record discounts provided to resellers for achieving purchasing targets as a reduction of revenue on the date of sale 
securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements requires us to estimate returns and warranty expenses prior to recognizing revenue 
since we have little history selling our products  at this time we are not able to estimate returns and warranty expense 
revenue from sales of our products prior to the time we are able to estimate returns and warranty expense will be deferred 
at january   we had approximately  of deferred revenue related to such transactions 
discontinued operations 
we recognized a net loss of approximately million in upon the disposition of our discontinued operations 
during fiscal  we increased our reserve for lease termination costs by approximately  and recorded an additional expense in that amount for discontinued operations  due to the continuing weakness in the commercial real estate market in austin  texas  where the unused facility is located 
the reserve for lease termination costs represents all future lease costs  which are currently in dispute with the landlord and subject of a lawsuit 
as of january   we had accrued approximately million for costs estimated to be incurred in future periods  consisting primarily of approximately million relating to lease termination costs  and approximately  relating to estimated legal fees and other expenses associated with pending legal matters 
any differences between these estimates and the actual amounts incurred in future periods will change the estimated net loss from discontinued operations accordingly 

table of contents deferred taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in our statement of operations 
significant judgment involving multiple variables is required in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
in assessing the potential realization of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon achieving future taxable income during the period in which our deferred tax assets are recoverable 
due to the uncertainty surrounding our ability to generate taxable income in the future  we have determined that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize any of the benefits of our deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carry forwards  before they expire 
therefore  we have provided a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets in each year of our existence  and our net deferred tax asset as of january  is zero 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets and review these assets for recoverability when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results  significant changes in the manner or use of the assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable based on the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment by estimating the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of these assets 
we record assets to be disposed of at the lower of the carrying amount or fair market value less anticipated costs of sales 
litigation 
we evaluate contingent liabilities  including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies and record accruals when the outcome of these matters is deemed probable and the liability is reasonably estimable 
we make these assessments based upon the facts and circumstances  and in some instances based in part upon the advice of outside legal counsel 
we include in these accruals an estimate to cover legal fees and expenses to defend ourselves 
because of the uncertainties related to certain pending litigation and claims  we are not able to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome  if any 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
at january   we had approximately  accrued for legal fees and other expenses  which is included in the estimated loss from discontinued operations 
inventory 
we adjust our inventory values so that the carrying value does not exceed net realizable value 
we estimate net realizable value based upon forecasted demand 
however  forecasted demand is subject to revisions and actual demand may differ 
this difference may have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents change in fiscal year on january   our board of directors changed our fiscal year from december to january  beginning with the fiscal year ending january  covered by this report 
the required separate audited financial statements covering the transition period from january  to january  are included in this annual report on form k 
we have not presented financial statements for the fiscal years ended january  and  but have instead presented financial statements for the fiscal years ended december  and  in compliance with rule a of the securities exchange act of because the adoption of our new fiscal year resulted in only a one month change in our annual and quarterly financial reporting periods  and considering that there would be little change in the reported information due to the early stage of our continuing business  we believe that the financial information for our fiscal year ended january  is sufficiently comparable to the corresponding financial information for our fiscal years and  as originally reported 
we do not consider our business to be seasonal and there are no other factors that materially interfere with the comparability of the fiscal years reported 
accordingly  we did not deem it practical  nor could we justify the additional cost  to prepare and present financial statements for the years ended january  and and for the calendar quarters corresponding to the new fiscal year for the year ended january  overview since the beginning of  our strategy has been to develop hardware and software offerings that enhance and manage various applications for high speed information systems 
in february  we announced our entry into the network security industry with our unityone line of products  the result of the development effort we initiated in this product line is designed to deliver high speed network defense solutions to corporate enterprises  governmental agencies  service providers and academic institutions 
in september  we announced the availability of our unityone product line 
in february  we announced three additional offerings in the unityone product line 
going forward  we anticipate that we will primarily focus our efforts on developing and marketing intrusion prevention products and services in the network security industry 
prior to  we primarily offered consumers internet access through devices commonly known as internet appliances  which we also marketed and sold to our customers 
we discontinued this business in conjunction with the initiation of our network security business 
the financial statements included elsewhere in this report present this business as discontinued operations for all historical periods 
our unityone line of intrusion prevention appliances and systems  which have high speed  security optimized  processors that can operate at gigabit speeds  are hardware based products designed to protect enterprise information systems from external and internal hostile  malicious or cyber terrorist attacks 
our products are designed to continually analyze internet and intranet traffic and block attacks commonly referred to as viruses  worms  trojans and denial of service attacks  before damage occurs and without compromising network performance 
we believe that our competitive advantage is the ability of our products to stop attacks in a network at gigabit per second speeds  without slowing network performance 
our hardware based platform is designed for network based attack prevention and is capable of supporting thousands of filters that can inspect each packet across a network segment without compromising network operating performance 
we believe that our approach offers customers an effective network based security solution with attractive economics  high performance  scalability and reliability 
our ips products are currently complementary to firewalls  but significantly improve protection against malicious attacks 
even with firewalls  organizations are still plagued by dangerous attacks such as code red  nimda and sapphire  which continue to penetrate through firewalls 
accordingly  ips products are increasingly seen as a critical tier of any multi tier security strategy 
firewalls offer security mechanisms for limited layers of network communications 
our unityone ips products protect information technology infrastructures from 
table of contents attacks that firewalls miss  and prevent intrusions within network communication that firewalls cannot prevent 
firewalls are also typically positioned at the network perimeter 
unityone ips products have the ability to be located either at the core of the network or at the perimeter  enabling protection from external and internal attacks and abuses 
results of continuing operations for the years ended january  and december  revenues we recognized no net revenue during the fiscal year ended january   although we had limited sales during the period 
we are still in the early stages of our business plan 
we expect to derive revenue primarily from sales of our hardware based security systems and appliances  and to a lesser extent from software products and services

sales and marketing expenses totaled approximately million for the year ended january  and approximately  for the year ended december  the increase in sales and marketing expenses during fiscal year was the result of the initiation of marketing efforts of our network security systems in late we expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to rise in our fiscal year as we further develop and expand our sales efforts 
for the month ended january   sales and marketing expenses totaled approximately  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were approximately million and million for the years ended january  and december   respectively 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses during fiscal year was primarily the result of a decrease in employment costs 
general and administrative expenses were approximately  for the month ended january  writedown of assets held for sale 
we recorded a writedown of assets held for sale of approximately  during the year ended january  and  during the year ended december  the writedown in fiscal represents additional charges incurred upon the final disposition of certain computer equipment and other fixed assets that we no longer use due to the change in our business 
the charge in fiscal is related to these assets when they were initially identified as assets held for sale 
there were no writedowns for the month ended january  stock based compensation expense 
for the years ended january  and december   we recorded stock based compensation of approximately  and approximately  respectively 
stock based compensation for the month ended january  was approximately  we recorded deferred stock compensation in connection with both the granting of stock options that had exercise prices 
table of contents deemed to be below fair market value on the date of grant and the granting of shares of restricted stock 
deferred stock compensation represents the deemed fair market value of our common stock for financial reporting purposes on the date of grant of shares of restricted stock and the difference between the fair market value of our common stock for financial reporting purposes on the date of grant of stock options and the exercise price of those options 
deferred stock compensation is included as a reduction of stockholders equity and is amortized over the vesting period of the applicable restricted stock or stock options  generally three years for restricted stock and four years for options  using the straight line vesting method 
this stock based compensation expense relates to restricted stock and stock options granted to individuals in all operating expense categories and has been included with other expenses in those categories 
the decrease in expense is due to the termination of options held by employees whose employment with us has terminated 
as of january   approximately  of deferred stock compensation remained unamortized 
this amount will be amortized through the quarter ending april  other interest income 
interest income  net of interest expense  totaled approximately  for the year ended january   as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest income in fiscal year is due to a general decrease in the average cash balances in interest bearing accounts we held at banking and financial institutions throughout the year  as well as a general reduction in the average yield earned on invested funds

as of january   we had accrued approximately million for costs estimated to be incurred in future periods  consisting primarily of approximately million relating to lease termination costs  and approximately  relating to estimated legal fees and other expenses associated with pending legal matters 
any differences between these estimates and the actual amounts incurred in future periods will change the estimated net loss from discontinued operations accordingly

general and administrative expenses were approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  including stock based compensation totaling approximately  and million  respectively 
the increase in these expenses  other than stock based compensation  from approximately million to approximately million  was primarily a result of an increase in corporate facility costs  an increase in insurance premiums and an increase in depreciation expense on fixed assets 
stock based compensation decreased significantly for due to the termination or resignation of administrative  finance and information systems personnel  and the termination of their options  during that year and the granting of certain vested options during that had exercise prices below the deemed fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant

discontinued operations 
from our inception through  we experienced operating losses as a result of selling our internet appliance at a significant loss  trying to build and support our internet service offering for our internet appliance customers  trying to expand our customer base and ultimately winding this business down 
in november  we began shifting our business model to focus on providing an offering for information systems and away from our consumer internet appliance offering 
in connection with this shift in focus  we restructured our operations

table of contents development expenses and sales and marketing expenses  capital expenditures and working capital needs until we achieve positive cash flows from operations 
we estimate that we have adequate cash to meet our needs for the next months 
we cannot give any assurance that any additional financing will be available  that we can ever achieve positive operating cash flows or that we will have sufficient cash from any source to meet our needs 
it is possible that we will exhaust all available funds before we reach the positive cash flow phase of our business model

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate and foreign currency exposure 
we limit our interest rate risks by placing our marketable securities investments with high quality issuers  principally the united states government  and corporate debt securities with terms of less than one year 
we do not expect any material losses from our marketable securities investments and believe that our interest rate exposure is modest 
we do not currently have  or hedge against  foreign currency exposure 

table of contents we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our loan facilities  which accrue interest at a floating rate 
if our effective interest rate under those facilities were to increase by basis points  our annual financing expense would increase by approximately  based on the average balances utilized under our loan facilities during the period ended january  we did not experience a material impact from interest rate risk during fiscal currently  we do not have any significant investments in financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes  or to manage our interest rate exposure
