these financial instruments are designated as hedges and accounted for on the accrual basis with gains and losses being recognized based on the type of contract and exposure being hedged 
realized gains or losses on crude oil and natural gas financial instruments designated as hedges of anticipated transactions are treated as deferred credits or charges and are included in other current liabilities or other current assets  as applicable  on the balance sheet

pennzoil also enters into short term forward exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain monetary liabilities and commitments denominated in foreign currencies 
the purpose of entering into these hedges is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the results of operations 
these contracts have maturity dates that do not exceed twelve months 
the unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are deferred and recognized in the results of operations in the period in which the hedged transaction is consummated

such fair value exceeded the long term debt carrying value by million 
pennzoil s long term debt obligations have fixed interest rates 
because pennzoil has no current plans to redeem these obligations before their stated maturity or call date  pennzoil is not exposed to cash flow or fair value risk from market interest rate changes 
the fair value of commercial paper and short term variable rate credit agreements is considered to be the same as the carrying amount 
reference is made to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
a hypothetical percent adverse change in market interest rates relative to the aforementioned securities would not have had a material effect on pennzoil s results of operations for the fiscal year ending december  interest charges  net during  pennzoil s interest charges  net of interest capitalized  decreased million from levels

the exchangeable debentures were issued in two series 
the exchangeable senior debentures the debentures  million principal amount outstanding  and the exchangeable senior debentures the debentures  million principal amount outstanding  are exchangeable into shares of chevron common stock at exchange rates of shares and shares  respectively  per  principal amount of debentures the equivalent of per share and per share  respectively 
the closing transactions price for chevron common stock reported on the new york stock exchange on december  was per share 
through december   million of the debentures and million of the debentures had been tendered for exchange 
the debentures and the debentures can be called at pennzoil s option beginning in january and october  respectively 
on december   pennzoil filed a registration statement on form s with the sec proposing to issue up to million principal amount of new exchangeable debentures new debentures in exchange the exchange offer for a portion of its debentures and its debentures 
the new debentures would have terms substantially similar to the existing debentures except for the maturity date  call date  coupon and the number of chevron shares into which the new debentures are exchangeable 
pursuant to the exchange offer as currently proposed  the new debentures would mature in  with an option to call the debentures by pennzoil beginning in  the coupon for the new debentures would be determined through a modified dutch auction process 
existing holders of exchangeable debentures accepted in the exchange would be given new debentures with par amounts equal to percent of the market value of the debentures submitted 
cash would be paid for any equivalent fractional new debentures 
the number of chevron shares which the new debentures are expected to be exchangeable into is percent of the number of shares that the submitted debentures were exchangeable into 
pennzoil currently intends to periodically sell the chevron shares that would no longer be required to be deposited with exchange agents as a result of the exchange offer 
pennzoil has also announced that it currently intends to call the remaining exchangeable debentures that are not accepted in the exchange offer 
if the exchange offer is completed as currently proposed  pennzoil expects to record an extraordinary after tax loss in of approximately million as a result of these transactions  this extraordinary loss is expected to be partially offset by an after tax gain of approximately million resulting from gains on the shares of chevron stock assumed to be delivered in exchange for existing exchangeable debentures under current exchange rights and gains on shares of chevron stock assumed to be sold 
shareholders equity would be increased by approximately million of after tax unrealized holding gain on chevron common stock beneficially owned by pennzoil  reflecting the adjustment to market value from net realizable value prior to the exchange offer of the remaining shares of chevron common stock held by pennzoil  reduced by liquidated holding gains on the shares of chevron stock assumed to be delivered in exchange for existing exchangeable debentures under current exchange rights and the shares of chevron stock assumed to be sold 
the net change to shareholders equity is estimated to be a reduction of approximately million 
the impact of the proposed exchange offer on long term debt would be a net decrease of approximately million due to an approximately million reduction in the amount of exchangeable debt and an approximately million reduction in variable rate credit arrangements as a result of the use of the proceeds of the proposed sale of chevron shares

environmental matters 
pennzoil continues to make capital and operating expenditures relating to the environment  including expenditures associated with its compliance with federal  state and local environmental regulations

in connection with pollution abatement efforts related to current operations  pennzoil made capital expenditures of approximately million in and million in capital expenditures for environmental control facilities are currently expected to be approximately million in pennzoil s recurring operating expenditures relating to environmental compliance activities are not material 
pennzoil is subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation activities associated with past operations  such as cercla  the resource conservation and recovery act and similar state statutes 
in response to liabilities associated with these activities  accruals have been established when reasonable estimates are possible 
such accruals primarily include estimated costs associated with remediation 
pennzoil has not used discounting in determining its accrued liabilities for environmental remediation  and no claims for possible recovery from third party insurers or other parties related to environmental costs have been recognized in pennzoil s consolidated financial statements 
pennzoil adjusts the accruals when new remediation responsibilities are discovered and probable costs become estimable  or when current remediation estimates must be adjusted to reflect new information 
pennzoil s assessment of the potential impact of these environmental laws is subject to uncertainty due to the difficult process of estimating remediation costs that are subject to ongoing and evolving change 
initial estimates of remediation costs reflect a broad based analysis of site conditions and potential environmental and human health impacts derived from preliminary site investigations including soil and water analysis  migration pathways and potential risk 
later changes in these initial estimates may be based on additional site investigations  completion of feasibility studies comparing and selecting from among various remediation methods and technologies and risk assessments determining the degree of current and future risk to the environment and human health  based on current scientific and regulatory criteria and the actual implementation of the remediation plan 
this process occurs over relatively long periods of time  is influenced by regulatory and community approval processes and is subject to the ongoing development of remediation technologies 
pennzoil s assessment analysis takes into account the condition of each site at the time of estimation  the degree of uncertainty surrounding the estimates for each phase of remediation and other site specific factors

in addition  certain of pennzoil s subsidiaries are involved in other environmental remediation activities  including the removal  inspection and replacement  as necessary  of underground storage tanks 
as of december  and  pennzoil s consolidated balance sheet included accrued liabilities for environmental remediation of million and million  respectively 
of these reserves  million and million are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet as current liabilities as of december  and  respectively  and million and million are reflected as other liabilities as of december  and  respectively 
pennzoil does not currently believe there is a reasonable possibility of incurring additional material costs in excess of the current accruals recognized for such environmental remediation activities 
with respect to the sites in which pennzoil subsidiaries are prps  pennzoil s conclusion is based in large part on i the availability of defenses to liability  including the availability of the petroleum exclusion under cercla and similar state laws  and or ii pennzoil s current belief that its share of wastes at a particular site is or will be viewed by the epa or other prps as being de minimis 
as a result  pennzoil s monetary exposure is not expected to be material
