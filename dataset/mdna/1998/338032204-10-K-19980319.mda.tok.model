see cautionary factors regarding forward looking statements 
during the third quarter of  fisher recorded a pretax million restructuring charge relating primarily to improving operations of its north american distribution system through consolidation and expansion of certain facilities 
this plan is substantially complete and the related accruals remaining of million will be substantially expended by the end of environmental matters some of fisher s operations involve and have involved the handling  manufacture or use of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous substances within the meaning of applicable environmental laws 
consequently  some risk of environmental and other damage is inherent in particular operations and products of fisher  as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses  and there can be no assurance that material damage will not occur or be discovered to have occurred or be determined to be material in the future 
the company is currently involved in various stages of investigation and remediation relative to environmental protection matters 
the company s fair lawn and somerville  new jersey facilities are the subject of administrative consent orders  issued pursuant to new jersey s environmental clean up and responsibility act ecra now called the industrial site recovery act isra  in connection with prior transfers of a controlling interest in the company  which require that certain remediation and other activities be undertaken at these sites 
the fair lawn facility is also part of a site listed on the superfund national priority list under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla 
fisher has also been notified that it is among the potentially responsible parties under cercla or similar state laws for the costs of investigating and or remediating contamination caused by hazardous materials at certain other sites 
the company s non superfund liabilities for environmental matters are principally related to compliance with ecra isra administrative consent orders and other environmental regulatory requirements such as the clean air act  the clean water act and other generally applicable requirements 
the potential costs related to environmental matters and the possible impact on future operations are difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup  the complexity and interpretation of applicable laws and regulations  the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods and the extent of the company s responsibility 
however  such costs could be material 
accruals for environmental liabilities are recorded  based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations  when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated 
estimates are established based upon reports prepared by environmental specialists  management s knowledge to date and its experience with the foregoing environmental matters  and include potential costs for investigation  remediation  operation and maintenance of cleanup sites and related capital expenditures 
accrued liabilities for environmental matters were million and million at december  and  respectively 
although these amounts do not include third party recoveries  certain sites may be subject to indemnification 
the company has accounted for environmental liabilities in accordance with accounting standards statement of position  environmental remediation liabilities  which addresses accounting and reporting for environmental remediation liabilities 
management believes this accrual is adequate for the environmental liabilities expected to be incurred and  as a result  believes that the ultimate liability incurred with respect to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial statements or results of operations 
however  future events  such as changes in existing laws and regulations  changes in agency direction or enforcement policies  or changes in the conduct of fisher s operations  may give rise to additional compliance costs which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial statements 
financial instruments the company s financial instruments consist primarily of cash in banks  investments in marketable securities  accounts receivable and debt 
in addition  the company has forward currency contracts that hedge certain firm commitments 
see notes and of notes to financial statements for additional information 
dividends the company paid a quarterly cash dividend of 
per share for the first three quarterly periods of fiscal and each of the quarterly periods of on january   in connection with the transaction  the company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement which restricts the company s ability to pay cash dividends 
accordingly  the company does not anticipate paying cash dividends on its common stock at any time in the future 
financial condition at december   current assets decreased million from december   with reductions in cash and cash equivalents of million  accounts receivable of million  inventories of million and other current assets of million 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents is primarily due to repayments on the company s bank credit facility 
the decrease in accounts receivable and inventories is primarily due to the company s overall efforts to reduce working capital which had increased during the integration of cms into fisher in current liabilities decreased by million primarily due to a decrease of million in accounts payable related to the company s overall effort to reduce working capital discussed above 
long term assets decreased by million  primarily due to asset write offs related to the restructuring plan which were partially offset by capital expenditures 
long term debt decreased by million  primarily due to repayments of the credit facility 
stockholders equity decreased by million primarily due to the company s net loss and the change in the currency translation adjustment 
cautionary factors regarding forward looking statements certain statements in this form k  in future filings by the company with the securities and exchange commission the commission  in the company s press releases  and in oral statements made by or with the approval of an authorized executive officer of the company constitute forward looking statements as that term is defined under the private securities litigation reform act of the act and releases issued by the commission 
these statements concern the beliefs or current expectations of the company or its management with respect to the company s operating and growth strategies  financing  regulatory matters  industry trends  competition  risks associated with foreign operations  reliance on suppliers  environmental matters and legal proceedings and other factors affecting the company s financial condition or results of operations 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that are beyond the company s control  and could cause the actual results  performance or achievements of the company to differ materially from those contemplated  projected  estimated or budgeted in or expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
these factors include general economic and business conditions  industry trends  overseas expansion  the loss of major customers or suppliers  the timing of orders received from customers  cost and availability of raw materials  changes in business strategy or development plans  availability and quality of management  and availability  terms and deployment of capital 
special attention should be paid to the forward looking statements including  but not limited to  statements relating to i the company s ability to execute its post merger business strategy  ii the company s ability to obtain sufficient resources to finance its working capital and capital expenditure needs and provide for its known obligations  iii industry sales growth and the ability of the company to make acquisitions  and iv the impact of environmental regulation on the company s operations 
the following factors should also be considered carefully in evaluating such forward looking statements substantial leverage  ability to service indebtedness as a result of the transaction  the company is highly leveraged  with indebtedness that is very substantial in relation to its shareholders equity 
after giving pro forma effect to the transaction as of december   the company s aggregate outstanding indebtedness would have been million and the company s shareholders equity would have been a deficit of million 
the company s high degree of leverage could have important consequences to stockholders  including but not limited to the following i the company s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired in the future  ii a substantial portion of the company s cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness  thereby reducing the funds available to the company for its operations and other purposes  including investments in research and development and capital spending  iii the company may be substantially more leveraged than certain of its competitors  which may place the company at a competitive disadvantage  iv the company may be hindered in its ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions  and v the company s substantial degree of leverage could make it more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or its business or changing market conditions and regulations 
the company s ability to repay or to refinance its obligations with respect to its indebtedness will depend on its future financial and operating performance  which  in turn  will be subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial  business  legislative  regulatory and other factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
these factors could include operating difficulties  increased operating costs  product pricing pressures  the response of competitors  regulatory developments  and delays in implementing strategic projects 
the company s ability to meet its debt service and other obligations may depend in significant part on the extent to which the company can implement successfully its business strategy 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to implement its strategy fully or that the anticipated results of its strategy will be realized 
if the company s cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund its debt service obligations  the company may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell assets  or seek to obtain additional equity capital  or to refinance or restructure its debt 
there can be no assurance that the company s cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient for payment of principal of  and premium  if any  and interest on  its indebtedness in the future  or that any such alternative measures would be successful or would permit the company to meet its scheduled debt service obligations 
in addition  because the company s obligations under the new credit facility will bear interest at floating rates  an increase in interest rates could adversely affect  among other things  the company s ability to meet its debt service obligations 
the company has entered into certain interest protection arrangements following the transaction with respect to a portion of its indebtedness under the new credit facility that has placed a cap on the interest rates payable thereon 
restrictive covenants the new credit facility and the notes contains a number of covenants that will significantly restrict the operations of the company and its ability to make certain types of aquisitions 
in addition  the company is required to comply with specified financial ratios and tests  including maximum leverage ratios and minimum ebitda to cash interest expense ratios  and certain of these ratios and tests are more restrictive in future years 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to comply with such covenants or restrictions in the future 
the company s ability to comply with such covenants and other restrictions may be affected by events beyond its control  including prevailing economic  financial and industry conditions 
the breach of any such covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the new credit facility that would permit the lenders thereunder to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable  together with accrued and unpaid interest  and terminate their commitments to make further extensions of credit thereunder 
difficulty in executing business strategy the business strategy that has been developed by the company is based on the company s current and historical operations and the operations of other companies in the scientific services industries 
the company s current business strategy is based  in part  on the company s ability to capitalize on benefits expected to result from various acquisitions and investments made by the company over the last few fiscal years  including the acquisitions of cms and fse  investments to expand the company s international operations and continued investment in ftg 
although partially completed  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully complete the integration of cms into its operations  or that such integration  when complete  will generate expected efficiencies and cost savings 
in addition  the company s consolidated international operations and ftg each incurred net losses in fiscal and are currently operating at a loss 
if the company is unable to improve the sales and profitability of its international business and of ftg  the company s financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
after the transaction  the company s management may decide to alter or discontinue certain parts of the business strategy described herein and may adopt alternative or additional strategies 
in addition  there can be no assurance that such a strategy  if implemented  will be successful or will improve operating results 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the successful implementation of such a strategy will result in improved operating results 
further  other conditions may exist  such as increased competition  or an economic downturn  which may offset any improved operating results that are attributable to such a strategy 
dependence on information systems  systems conversion  year issue the company s business is dependent in part on its information systems 
these systems play an integral role in tracking product offerings including pricing and availability  processing and shipping customer orders  warehouse operations  purchasing  inventory management  financial reporting  and other operational functions 
the company is currently in the process of implementing a project whereby many of its present computer systems  including its order entry  purchasing and financial systems will be replaced 
this conversion is expected to occur over the next two years 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience unanticipated delays  complications and expenses in implementing  integrating and operating such systems 
failure to successfully complete the conversion of the company s current computer system on a timely basis or failures with respect to the company s systems generally could result in operational and financial disruptions and could also lead to cost overruns 
the company is dealing with year issues 
year issues exist when dates in computer systems are recorded using two digits rather than four and are then used for arithmetic operations  comparisons or sorting 
a two digit date recording may recognize a date using as rather than  which could cause the company s computer systems to perform inaccurate computations 
the company s year issues related not only to its own systems but also to those of its customers and suppliers 
it is anticipated that the company s program to enhance its systems capabilities described above  and other year activities of the company with respect to systems not being replaced  will resolve the year issue with respect to the company s internal systems 
although management believes its program to address year issues is adequate  there is no guarantee that the program is in fact adequate or that the systems replacements and modifications will be completed on time 
even if the company s year conversion is completed  the failure of the company s suppliers and customers to address the year issue could result in disruption or significantly impact the company 
see note to financial statements 
dependence on corporate research and development spending the company s customers include corporations active in scientific or technological research  healthcare  industrial  safety and other markets  both in the us and internationally 
the research and development budgets and activities of these companies have a significant effect on the demand for products manufactured and or distributed by the company 
such policies are based on a variety of factors  including the need to develop new products  competition and availability of resources 
although scientific and technology related research and development spending in the us historically has not been subject to cyclical swings  no assurance can be made that this trend will continue 
in addition  as the company continues to expand its international operations  the research and development spending levels in other global markets will become increasingly important 
a decrease in research and development spending by the company s customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
healthcare reform  cost containment the company s sales to the us clinical laboratory market have historically been significant 
the trend towards managed care  together with efforts to reform the healthcare delivery system in the us  has resulted in increased pressure on healthcare providers and other participants in the healthcare industry to reduce costs
