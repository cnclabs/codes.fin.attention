item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations year ended june  compared to year ended june  the company had a net loss in the year ended june  of  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended june  the loss is primarily due to expensed costs of ongoing battery product development and continued market development  losses related to electrode production as the company optimizes its product performance  ongoing protection of the company s technologies and patents  expenses of additional technical  manufacturing and engineering support for gm ovonic llc gm ovonic  the company s manufacturing joint venture with general motors corporation general motors  in furtherance of initial nickel metal hydride nimh battery production and ongoing technical assistance to other customers  and development of multi state electrical memory 
the net loss  excluding revenues from license and other agreements  which are non recurring  was reduced to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june  product sales consisting of positive and negative battery electrodes  battery packs and machine building  decreased to  in the year ended june  from  in the year ended june  sales of negative and positive electrodes decreased  primarily due to lower negative electrode prices and lower shipments to its primary customer 
battery pack sales decreased to  from  as gm ovonic  formerly the company s principal battery pack customer  began its own production of battery packs 
revenues from machine building were  in the year ended june  down from  in the year ended june  principally due to completion of the machine building projects for gm ovonic 
royalties increased from  in the year ended june  to  in the year ended june  due to the issuance in japan of a basic nimh battery patent in august  to the company s ovonic battery company inc subsidiary ovonic battery  causing nimh battery sales in japan to be royalty bearing  and due to higher sales of nimh batteries worldwide 
despite the higher volume of nimh batteries being sold  the royalties the company receives were adversely affected by lower sales prices and unfavorable exchange rates with the japanese yen 
the company experienced lower levels of royalties from ecd s phase change rewritable optical memory technology in as the company s licensees prepared to introduce new types of ecd s phase change rewritable media products

other income of  in the year ended june  compares to other income of  in the year ended june  the reduction was due principally to decreased interest income in and the recording of the company s share of losses of united solar systems corp 
united solar joint venture of  for related to the company s  investment in united solar in may the company does business in many different parts of the world and its royalty revenues are affected by changes in foreign currencies and their exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
however  the vast majority of the company s business agreements are denominated in us dollars and  as such  the company has minimized its exposure to currency rate fluctuations 
year ended june  compared to year ended june  the company had a net loss in the year ended june  of  compared to net income of  for the year ended june  the change in profitability was primarily due to the gain on the sale of  of ovonic battery stock in the prior year  the approximate  reduction in one time license fees in the year ended june  and the investment by the company of its own funds in the current year to develop a new family of ovonic nimh batteries 
the net loss in the year ended june  resulted primarily from investment of company funds for development of electric and hybrid vehicle batteries  decreased revenues for such development work  costs related to start up and expansion of negative electrode production equipment and initiation of positive electrode production and equipment  expenses of additional technical  manufacturing and engineering support for the gm ovonic manufacturing joint venture in furtherance of initial nimh battery production and ongoing technical assistance to other customers  development of multi state electrical memory  and costs related to defending the company s patents 
when revenue from license fees  which are non recurring and sporadic  and the gain on the sale of ovonic battery stock in  are excluded  the decrease in profitability from to is approximately  product sales increased slightly to  in the year ended june  from  in the year ended june  due to a  increase in from sales of negative and positive electrodes  offset by a  decrease in machine building revenues as a result of completion of production machinery for gm ovonic and united solar 
royalties increased to  in the year ended june  from  in the year ended june   primarily due to increases in royalties from battery technology  partially offset by decreases in royalties from phase change rewritable memory products  as prices of these products decreased pending introduction of newer generation phase change rewritable products 
royalties from licensees based in japan were also negatively impacted by the weakness in the japanese yen 
see note b notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenues from product development agreements decreased from  in the year ended june  to  in the year ended june  due to reductions in revenues recognized in government sponsored programs in photovoltaic and battery technologies 
this decrease was a result of the us government spending reduction program 
see note b notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenues from license agreements decreased to  in the year ended june  from  in the year ended june  due to the reduction in of battery license agreements 
see note b notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenues from license agreements are non recurring  and are based upon developing new business relationships 
the increase in other revenues was due to increased billings in for services performed by the company s central analytical laboratory  production technology and machine building division  as well as miscellaneous work performed for ovonic battery licensees 
the increase in the cost of product sales to  in the year ended june  from  in the year ended june  was principally due to  in inventory adjustments for ovonic battery  primarily related to obsolescence and changed customer specifications  higher costs related to start up and expansion of negative electrode production equipment and initiation of positive electrode production in the decrease in cost of revenues from product development agreements in the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  was principally due to decreases in activities during under the agreements with usabc  national renewable energy laboratory and department of energy 
the increase in product development expenses to  in the year ended june  from  in the year ended june  was the result of the aforementioned reduced funding under the agreements with usabc and related increased ovonic battery product development and research expenses 
patent defense costs were  in the year ended june  and  in the year ended june  in  patent defense costs were incurred for litigation with mbi with respect to certain of ovonic battery s united states patents covering its proprietary technology for nimh batteries 
in  patent defense costs primarily related to the defense and prosecution of litigation involving saft america  inc and certain related companies or entities and mbi 
the change from other income net of  in the year ended june  compared to  of other income net in the year ended june  was due principally to the  gain on the sale of ovonic battery common stock in liquidity and capital resources as of june   the company had unrestricted consolidated cash and cash equivalents and investments  consisting of commercial paper maturing in four to six months  of  an increase of  from june  in addition  the company had accounts receivable at june  of  compared to  at june  as of june   the company had consolidated working capital of  compared with a consolidated working capital of  as of june  the company is pursuing its strategies to commercialize its products through strategic alliances by forming joint ventures or license agreements with third parties who can provide financial resources and marketing expertise for the company s technologies and products 
the company is also developing its own capabilities for volume manufacturing of battery electrodes 
during the year ended june    of cash was used in operations 
the difference between the net loss of  and the net cash used in operations was due to depreciation expense and a reduction in accounts receivables 
in addition  during this period  of machinery and equipment was purchased or constructed for the company s operations 
during the next months  the company is considering the purchase of up to  of machinery and equipment 
the machinery and equipment would be utilized principally for ovonic battery s manufacturing operation 
the company has two major electrode customers for its battery electrode products  gp batteries international limited gp batteries and gm ovonic 
the company and gp batteries are currently negotiating electrode product specifications and pricing 
these negotiations could result in gp batteries manufacturing its own electrode products or purchasing such products from a manufacturer other than ovonic battery 
sales of electrode products to gm ovonic are expected to increase as gm ovonic ramps up its production of battery packs at an expanded manufacturing facility 
nonetheless  sales of electrode products in the near term and in fiscal year are expected to decrease 
the company has taken steps to reduce its costs in a manner consistent with the expected lower volumes of electrode product sales 
the company expects significant revenues and cash flows related to product development agreements  many of which already exist  that are entered into by the company with us government agencies and with industry partners to develop the company s products and production technology 
contracts with industry partners include a multi task  multi million dollar program with general motors to develop batteries for electric and hybrid electric vehicle applications which is presently projected to conclude in june  this program  which is funded on a monthly basis  builds upon the company s earlier investments to develop a family of batteries and is intended to provide next and future generation nimh batteries that will be manufactured by gm ovonic 
three contracts awarded to the company by nist  in the fall of  under three advanced technology programs atp will also provide significant cash flows 
one contract was awarded to ovonic battery to develop the next generation of high energy density nimh batteries using low cost magnesium based hydrogen storage materials 
the other two nist contracts were awarded to ecd to support development of a new  low cost manufacturing system for dvd digital versatile disks based on ecd s proprietary phase change technology and for further development of the optical memory phase change products 
generally  the agreed upon fees for these product development agreements reimburse the company for its direct costs associated with these projects  together with a portion of indirect costs patents  operating  general and administrative expenses and depreciation 
in april  the company entered into a one year financing agreement with standard federal bank for a line of credit of up to  this financing bears an interest rate of prime plus  is secured by a first interest in the company s accounts receivable and inventory  and contains certain financial covenants relating to the company s tangible net worth  working capital and total debt to tangible net worth 
the company has not borrowed under this financing agreement 
in april  the company also entered into a  credit arrangement with finova capital corporation  which has two components 
one component  which has been fully utilized  provided  to refinance existing leased equipment  resulting in  net cash to the company  has a three year term at the expiration of which the company will be required to purchase the equipment for  the second component provides for up to  of financing through december  for the company s sale and leaseback of equipment it acquired subsequent to june  at the expiration of the related five year lease  the company will be required to purchase the leased equipment for of the original cost 
at june  the company has entered into sale and leaseback arrangements of  in connection with the second component 
in may   the company completed a limited public offering of  units  each consisting of one share of ecd common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of ecd common stock for net proceeds of approximately the company is actively pursuing its strategy to form strategic alliances to further commercialize its products 
while the company is in negotiations with a number of companies which could provide additional revenue under license and other agreements for the company in the coming year  it is unable to predict the amount  if any  of such revenue 
in august  the company was issued a basic patent in japan specifying the fundamentals that make nimh batteries commercially feasible and causing nimh battery sales in japan to be royalty bearing 
the issuance of this patent has resulted in higher royalty revenue and is expected to result in the payment of higher running royalties in the future based upon current production rates and selling prices of batteries produced in japan by licensees 
other than the foregoing  the company is not aware of other events or circumstances that would allow it to forecast royalty revenues significantly higher or lower for the next months 
the company is also actively negotiating new machine building contracts that could provide revenues in the coming year and beyond 
machine building is cyclical but an important part of the company s business 
as of june   the company had no backlog of machine building contracts 
based upon the above information  the amount of cash to be received under existing product development agreements in the year ending june  is anticipated to be approximately  compared to  received from product development agreements in the year ended june  the amount of cash for royalties to be received in the year ending june  is expected to be  based on historical trends  approximately  compared to  received in the year ended june  since license fees are sporadic and difficult to predict  the company is unable to predict the amount of cash to be received from license fees in the year ending june  management believes that funds generated from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to support and finance planned growth  capital expenditures and company sponsored product development programs over the coming year 
it is the company s intent to use its cash and investments to fund its operations 
additional sources of cash are  however  required to sustain the company for the long term and to build the business in the future 
while it is the company s intent to fund its operations from cash and cash equivalent balances on hand and from activities such as product sales  licensing  royalties and product development agreements  the amount and timing of revenues from such activities are uncertain such that the company may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing 
year issue historically  many computer programs have been written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  which could result in the program failing to properly recognize a year that begins with instead of this  in turn  could result in major system failures or miscalculations and is generally referred to as the year issue 
the company has formulated a year plan to address the company s year issues 
the company s own internal systems are a primary area of focus 
the company installed a new computer system in july to run its financial  business reporting and data processing software applications 
the providers of the application software used in the new computer system have represented the software to be year compliant 
the company is currently evaluating its other software applications  including  but not limited to  its computerized laboratory manufacturing equipment and imbedded chips to identify any year issues that may significantly disrupt the company s operations in a material manner 
the company s year plan is to 
inventory hardware  software and equipment 
test and or confirm hardware  software and equipment considered year compliant 
identify year issues 
determine necessary measures to address issues 
implement remedies 
test and confirm 
the above steps will overlap to a significant degree and the company is currently in various stages of each of these steps 
the company presently plans to have identified all issues related to critical operations by the end of calendar and have implemented remedies no later than june the company believes that most non compliant software can be upgraded from equipment manufacturers and software providers 
it is currently estimated that the cost of year compliance will be less than  primarily for the purchase of upgraded software and new or upgraded computers 
this preliminary estimate is based on presently available information and will be updated as the company continues to implement its year plan 
if the company s new computer system fails with respect to the year issue or if any applications or embedded chips critical to the company s manufacturing process are overlooked  there could be a material adverse impact on the business operations or financial performance of the company 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have material adverse effect on the business operations or financial performance of the company 
in particular  if third party providers  due to the year issue  fail to provide the company with components  materials or energy which are necessary to timely complete contractual requirements or to manufacture its products  then any such failure could have a material adverse effect on the business operations and financial performance of the company 
the company has not yet established a contingency plan  but intends to formulate one to address unavoided or unavoidable risks and expects to have the contingency plan formulated by july
