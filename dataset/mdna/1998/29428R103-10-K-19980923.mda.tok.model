in recent years jackpot has faced increased competition in its gaming machine route operations  and as certain of its licenses  leases and subleases have begun to expire  it has faced strong competition from other route operators who have attempted or captured locations by offering more favorable terms to retail store owners 
as a result of such competition  along with the company s continual evaluation of leases and adherence to management s pricing guidelines  revenues generated from route operations  which are attributable to revenue sharing contracts  have decreased since fiscal for additional information concerning jackpot s revenue sharing contracts  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

overview route operations jackpot has a significant amount of its route operations at retail stores which are part of a group of affiliated store chains 
route operations from two groups of affiliated store chains in  and each accounted for more than of jackpot s total revenues in such fiscal years 
the largest five store chains albertson s  inc  american drug stores  inc  kmart corporation  lucky stores  inc 
and rite aid corporation accounted for approximately of jackpot s total revenues in agreements with these five customers have expiration dates ranging from to such agreements provide jackpot the continued right to operate gaming machines at certain existing locations and future locations in nevada  if any  of such customers 
the loss or nonrenewal of any of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on the company s future results of operations 
in august  albertson s  inc and american stores company the parent company of lucky stores  inc and american drug stores  inc 
announced that the companies have entered into a definitive merger agreement 
per the announcement  such transaction is expected to close in early calendar  subject to various approvals 
route operations revenues generated at the locations of the combined entities represent a significant portion of jackpot s total revenues  and if such transaction had occurred at the beginning of fiscal  such revenues would have accounted for approximately of jackpot s total revenues in the renewal or extension of agreements with the customers mentioned above have generally resulted in increased monthly fees 
these contracts often require fixed periodic increases in monthly fees during the term of the contract 
with respect to the accounting treatment of fixed periodic increases in monthly fees associated with these contracts  the company is required to average annual lease costs over the term of the contract 
as a result of such accounting treatment  annual lease costs generally increase significantly in the first year of an extended contract for the respective locations covered by the contract and  thereafter  remain constant for existing locations during the term of the contract 
despite a long term relationship with warehouse markets  inc  a significant customer  jackpot was not willing to agree with the terms sought for a contract extension  which management believed were uneconomic 
the agreement  which expired on june   involved the operation of approximately gaming machines in locations 
in  jackpot generated approximately of its total revenues and a significant amount of operating income from operations at such customer s locations 
in  jackpot entered into agreements for long term contract extensions  which became effective july   with four of its largest retail chain store customers  two of which were not due to expire on june  a very competitive pricing environment caused the company to offer significant increases in location rent over the existing agreements

in september  jackpot entered into an agreement for a long term contract extension with one of its largest retail store customers 
pursuant to the terms of the new agreement  which will become effective july   rent expense will increase significantly over the previous agreement 
such increase could adversely affect the company s results of operations for the year ending june  excluding the aforementioned long term extension  license  lease and sublease agreements  representing agreements and approximately of route operations revenues  have terms expiring during casino operations on august   jackpot s board of directors approved a plan to dispose of jackpot owl  inc the owl club and jackpot s highway casino  inc the pony express casino  jackpot s two remaining casinos  as part of its strategy to exit its casino operations 
this decision was reached after considering that these casino operations generated unacceptably low returns on capital  possessed limited growth prospects and commanded a disproportionately high amount of management time 
although the company continues to market these two casinos for sale  no assurance can be given that such disposals will occur

costs and expenses route operations expenses increased million  from million in to million in and  as a percentage of route operations revenues  increased to in from in such increases were principally attributable to an increase in location rent 
as previously mentioned  jackpot entered into agreements for long term extensions with four of its largest retail chain store customers during a very competitive pricing environment caused jackpot to offer significant increases in location rent  which is the single largest route operations expense  over the existing agreements 
such extensions became effective july  the increase in route operations expenses of million resulted primarily from a combination of an increase of million in location rent for locations of existing chain store customers  which was related to the four chain store renewals described above  an increase of million in location rent for new locations of existing chain store customers  net of decreases in location rent for lost chain store customers and other route operations expenses of million and million  respectively

year in the past  many computer software programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this situation is generally referred to as the year problem 
if such situation occurs  the potential exists for computer system failures or miscalculations by computer programs  which could disrupt operations 
jackpot has conducted a comprehensive review of its computer systems and other systems for the purpose of assessing its potential year problem  and is in the process of modifying or replacing those systems which are not year compliant 
based upon this review  management believes such systems will be compliant by mid calendar however  if modifications are not made or not completed timely  the year problem could have a significant adverse impact on the company s operations 
in addition  jackpot has communicated with its major vendors and suppliers to determine their state of readiness relative to the year problem and jackpot s possible exposure to year issues of such third parties 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies  which the company s systems may rely upon  will be timely converted or representations made to jackpot by these parties are accurate 
as a result  the failure of a major vendor or supplier to adequately address their year problem could have a significant adverse impact on the company s operations 
planning for the year problem  including contingency planning  is significantly complete and will be revised  if necessary 
all costs related to the year problem are expensed as incurred  while the cost of new hardware is capitalized and amortized over its expected useful life 
the costs associated with year compliance have not been and are not anticipated to be material to the company s financial position or results of operations

the estimated completion date and remaining costs are based upon management s best estimates  as well as third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that such estimates will occur and actual results could differ
