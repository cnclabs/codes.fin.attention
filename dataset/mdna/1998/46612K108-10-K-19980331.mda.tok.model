industry background the retailing industry is experiencing rapid change  driven primarily by changing consumer preferences  intensifying competition and increasing globalization 
consumers purchase patterns have shifted  with today s consumer choosing value  in the form of lower prices and improved convenience and personal service  over brand and retailer loyalty 
the result for many retailers has been increased pressure on operating profits as they try to lower prices and increase marketing and promotions to increase traffic in stores in order to increase sales 
in addition  new retail formats  such as the category killer format employed by retailers such as staples and petco  have enjoyed broad market acceptance and are setting the standards for lower prices and improved customer service 
to exploit international growth opportunities a number of retailers are seeking to apply their concepts outside their domestic markets 
despite the significant challenges in the retail industry  many retailers have successfully achieved efficiencies and reduced operating costs by improving inventory management  decentralizing the decision making process while centralizing purchasing and other administrative functions  deploying state of the art information technology and pursuing aggressive roll out strategies to achieve economies of scale 
to respond to today s competitive challenges  retailers must accelerate the rate at which they identify and respond to changing business conditions and consumer requirements 
a retail organization s agility and ultimate success are dependent upon its ability to rapidly and cost effectively collect  organize and analyze data  and disseminate information throughout the enterprise to facilitate effective business decisions 
such information provides a basis for critical product  marketing  inventory  pricing and human resource decisions 
in addition  inventory management has become more complicated as retailers seek to reduce costs and improve margins while replenishing inventory on a just in time basis 
accordingly  retailers are demanding more sophisticated purchasing  inventory management and merchandising tools that enable them to distribute and manage goods efficiently 
retailers are also increasingly restructuring existing operations so that consumers interact effectively with the entire enterprise from a single store location 
this requires store level personnel and decision makers throughout an enterprise to have a common base of readily available sales and inventory information and that in store personnel have the ability to more rapidly respond to consumers needs 
to meet their increasing requirements for information  retailers seek information systems that are adept at handling large volumes of transactions  possess a high degree of reliability  accommodate peak load and seasonal requirements and rapidly capture and analyze data and distribute information throughout the geographically dispersed parts of the enterprise 
moreover  global retailers require applications that support the specialized requirements of international business  including local language support  multiple currencies  import export costing and foreign tax and regulatory requirements 
retailers are also seeking solutions that address emerging technical and business issues  such as year compliance and the increased prevalence of electronic commerce 
historically  information technology in the retail supply chain has consisted largely of separate legacy applications at the corporate  store and distribution levels 
these legacy applications have primarily been host centric systems that operate on mainframe or mid range computers 
these systems  developed and modified internally over many years or licensed from third parties  represent considerable investments by retailers and have provided benefits within their distinct roles 
however  they generally do not have the flexibility to support diverse and changing operations within a customer s business or to respond effectively to changing technologies 
additionally  these solutions have only targeted distinct levels of the retail supply chain such as the corporate or in store levels  and have not generally provided the full benefits of integration  which allows information to be distributed effectively throughout the retail enterprise 
despite these limitations  many host centric systems are still being widely deployed for retail applications because of their strengths in particular segments  as well as to preserve significant hardware and software investments 
furthermore  retailers have historically been cautious in adopting new technologies due to the real time  transaction intensive nature of retailing and the economic consequences of disruptions to their operations 
despite their reservations  retailers are recognizing the strategic imperative of employing technology to cut costs  reduce inefficiencies and enhance sales in an increasingly competitive environment dominated by value conscious consumers 
the development of distributed client server computing has created a technological framework for software applications that are adaptable  integrated and tailored for the retail supply chain 
additionally  improved hardware price performance and database capabilities on platforms such as the ibm as have improved the capabilities of the information systems that can leverage retailers existing hardware investments 
as a result  retailers are demanding highly functional  easy to use and scaleable software applications that can be economically and rapidly implemented and adapted for changes in their mission critical business functions 
the company believes that the adoption of new information technologies by retailers will accelerate as competitive pressures increasingly necessitate the ability to change business practices quickly and to empower employees with the information and tools to respond to consumer requirements

dss and win dss are comprised of functional modules that are selected by the customer and can be configured to fit the customer s unique requirements 
dss can be licensed independently and utilized with a customer s existing merchandise management system  or it can work in concert with the company s mms merchandise management system  to provide the retailer the ability to manage information through a wide range of retail operations 
a typical installation of dss enables the retailer to perform a number of individual store level functions and support back office  store inventory and point of sale operations 
for example  store managers can use dss to measure the results of a store promotional event 
in addition  dss enables retailers to track the preferences of individual consumers and provide a higher level of personalized service 
win dss incorporates the core functionality of dss with the enhanced capabilities of the windows platforms 
win dss incorporates an object oriented software design that is capable of arranging retail business processes to adapt to a retailer s specialized and evolving requirements 
for example  a retailer can utilize the win dss multi tasking capabilities by configuring its point of sale systems to simultaneously run credit authorizations  process transactions and update store inventory records 
in addition  to reflect a more service oriented workflow  the customer service desk in the same store can be configured to provide ready access to personal information and purchase histories of individual consumers

the company believes its ability to provide these services provides a competitive advantage  which is expected to be enhanced by a developing cooperative relationship with ibm global services division to jointly support  distribute and implement odbms 
as of december   the company had employees in its consulting  maintenance and other services organization 
the company is pursuing a strategy to increasingly utilize third party consultants  such as those from major systems integrators  to assist in certain large scale implementations and for extensive business process re engineering projects

the company s consulting engagements have typically taken between six months and one year for merchandise management systems  between three and six months for in store systems  between three and six months for warehouse and logistic systems  and between two and three months for data warehouse systems 
given the complexity of platforms on which the company s odbms and win dss systems operate and the increased ability of the customer to configure these new products to its work flows and processes  the implementation of such systems generally requires increased levels of consulting services  as well as longer periods of time 
in order to satisfy the demands of both existing and future customers  the company plans to substantially increase its consulting services personnel to support anticipated growth in product implementations 
to the extent anticipated revenues fail to materialize following the hiring and training of such personnel  the company s operating results would be adversely affected

internationally  in addition to its direct sales force  the company leverages its cooperative relationships with sales agents  distributors  and other vendors  including ibm in china  columbia  india  the middle east and scandinavia 
additional relationships with system integrators  other major hardware vendors and the retail systems consulting groups of major accounting firms are also components of the company s sales and marketing strategy 
the company believes these relationships provide important product endorsements and valuable feedback as well as sales referrals 
while the sales cycle varies substantially from customer to customer  it typically requires six to nine months from generation of the sales lead to execution of a license agreement 
because of the complexity and technical nature of the company s systems  consulting and product development employees often participate directly in the sales cycle and educate prospective customers on the advantages of using the company s solutions 
the company s marketing activities are directed at increasing market awareness of the company s products and services and identifying prospective customers 
the execution of major agreements with customers  when agreed to by the customer  are accompanied by press announcements and public relations activities 
the company combines attendance at key trade shows with a limited amount of focused advertising and direct mail campaigns to generate prospects 
in addition to these activities  the company s marketing personnel provide extensive support to the sales organization  including responding to requests for proposals  conducting product demonstrations and determining hardware specifications 
the marketing organization is also responsible for corporate communications and development of sales tools and marketing materials 
as of december   the company s sales and marketing organization consisted of sales and marketing personnel in the united states and sales and marketing personnel in the rest of the world 
product development and jda technology the company has invested and expects to continue to invest substantial resources in research and development 
the company believes that its future performance will depend in large part on its ability to maintain and enhance its current products  develop new products that achieve market acceptance  maintain technological competitiveness and meet an expanding range of customer requirements 
the company intends to continue development efforts towards new products  such as its recently released odbms product  and enhancements that address emerging requirements for highly adaptable applications utilizing the advantages of client server technologies across multiple platforms 
in addition  the company continues to devote significant resources to modify its mms product line to take advantage of recent client server enhancements to the ibm as platform 
the company s software design philosophy is to develop products with broad  enterprise wide retailing functionality that is applicable to the majority of retailers needs 
at the same time  the company s objective is to design products that are easily tailored to the specific work flows and business processes of the individual retailer and are readily adapted to changing conditions  reducing the amount of software modification required 
the company has established a design framework  known as the advanced retail architecture ara  based on the principles of open systems and object oriented technologies  for developing new products and modules 
this architecture is designed to protect the company s investment in product development  as well as its customers software investment  from changes in underlying technology and front end interfaces 
the company believes products designed to ara specifications can support multiple platforms and accommodate platform changes or new platforms generally without significant modification to the jda application 
the company s products designed within the ara framework are odbms  win dss and wcc 
the company intends to apply ara to the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products to the extent feasible 
however  the company s ability to take advantage of the full scope of ara design objectives is limited by the proprietary nature of the ibm as and dos based platforms upon which mms and dss operate 
as of december   there were employees on the company s product development staff 
the company s product development expenditures in  and were million  million and million  and represented  and of revenues  respectively 
the company currently expects product development expenses in to be between million and million 
the company s ongoing product development efforts include projects related to shortening the implementation cycle and facilitating the integration of its products 
the company s newer software products  odbms  win dss  retail ideas and wcc  which are designed for open client server environments  have all been commercially released within the last months 
to date  only a limited number of customers have licensed or implemented the company s client server products 
the market for these products is new and evolving  and the company believes that retailers may generally be more cautious than other businesses in adopting client server technologies 
consequently  it is difficult to assess or predict with any assurance the growth rate  if any  and size of the market for the company s client server products  and there can be no assurance that this market will continue to develop 
potential and existing customers may find it difficult  or be unable  to successfully implement the company s client server products  or may not purchase such products for a variety of reasons  including the customer s inability to obtain hardware  software  networking infrastructure  or sufficient internal staff required to implement  operate and maintain an open client server solution  the generally longer time periods and greater cost required to implement such products as compared to ibm as based products  and limited implementation experience with such products by the company s service personnel or third party implementation providers 
furthermore  the company must overcome significant obstacles to successfully market its client server solutions  including limited experience of the company s sales and consulting personnel in the client server market and limited existing reference accounts in this market 
if the market for the company s client server products fails to develop  develops more slowly than expected or becomes saturated with competitors  or if the company s products do not achieve market acceptance  the company s business  operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
the computer software industry is subject to rapid technological change  changing customer requirements  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards that may render existing products and services obsolete 
as a result  the company s position in its existing markets or other markets that it may enter could be eroded rapidly by technological advancements not embraced by the company 
the life cycles of the company s products are difficult to estimate 
the products must keep pace with technological developments  conform to evolving industry standards and address increasingly sophisticated customer needs 
in particular  the company believes that it must continue to respond quickly to users needs for broad functionality and multi platform support and to advances in hardware and operating systems 
introduction of new products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render the company s products obsolete and unmarketable 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience future difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of new products  or that new products and product enhancements will meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance 
if the company is unable to develop and introduce products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  the company s business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the company strives to achieve compatibility between those products and retailing systems platforms which management believes are  or will become  popular and widely adopted 
the company invests substantial resources in development efforts aimed at achieving such compatibility 
any failure by the company to anticipate or respond adequately to technology or market developments could result in a loss of competitiveness or revenue 
competition the markets for retail information systems are highly competitive 
the company believes the principal competitive factors in such markets are product quality  reliability  performance and price  vendor and product reputation  retail industry expertise  financial stability  features and functions  ease of use and quality of support 
a number of companies offer competitive products addressing certain of the company s target markets 
in the enterprise systems market  the company competes with in house systems developed by the company s targeted customers and with third party developers such as intrepid systems intrepid  island pacific  radius plc  retek a subsidiary of hnc software  inc  sts systems and richter management services 
in addition  the company believes that new market entrants may attempt to develop fully integrated enterprise level systems targeting the retail industry 
in particular  sap ag has announced the availability of an integrated client server enterprise system competitive with the company s products  and intrepid has announced the formation of a joint development and marketing relationship with peoplesoft  inc  a provider of enterprise applications software  to develop products that are expected to compete directly with odbms 
in the in store systems market  which is more fragmented than the enterprise market  the company competes with major hardware original equipment manufacturers such as icl  ncr  and ibm  as well as software companies such as crs business computers  datavantage  sts systems  trimax and gers retail systems 
in the distribution and warehouse management systems market  the company s wcc product competes with products from catalyst international  inc  exe and mchugh freeman 
the retail ideas product competes with products from microstrategy and intrepid  among other vendors 
in the market for consulting services  the company is pursuing a strategy of forming informal working relationships with leading retail systems integrators such as andersen consulting and ernst young llp  and other similar major systems integrators 
these integrators  as well as independent consulting firms such as ibm global services division  also represent potential competition to the company s consulting services group 
many of the company s existing competitors  as well as a number of potential new competitors  have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than the company  each of which could provide them with a significant competitive advantage over the company 
many of the company s existing competitors  as well as a number of potential new competitors  have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than the company  each of which could provide them with a significant competitive advantage over the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against its current or future competitors or that competition would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
proprietary rights the company s success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon its proprietary technology  including its software source code 
to protect its proprietary technology  the company relies on a combination of trade secret  nondisclosure and copyright law  which may afford only limited protection 
in addition  effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
the company presently has no patents or patent applications pending 
the source code for the company s proprietary software is protected both as a trade secret and as a copyrighted work 
although the company relies on the limited protection afforded by such intellectual property laws  it also believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel  new product developments  frequent product enhancements  name recognition and reliable maintenance are also essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position 
the company generally enters into confidentiality or license agreements with its employees  consultants and customers  and generally controls access to and distribution of its software  documentation and other proprietary information 
the terms of the company s license agreements with its customers often require the company to provide the customer with a listing of the product source code 
although the license agreements place restrictions on the use by the customer of the company s source code and do not permit the re sale  sublicense or other transfer of such source code  there can be no assurance that unauthorized use of the company s technology will not occur 
despite the measures taken by the company to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to reverse engineer or copy aspects of the company s products or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of the company s products is difficult 
in addition  litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce the company s intellectual property rights  to protect the company s trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
certain technology used by the company s products is licensed from third parties  generally on a non exclusive basis 
these licenses generally require the company to pay royalties and fulfill confidentiality obligations 
the company believes that alternative resources exist for each of the material components of technology licensed by the company from third parties 
however  the termination of any such licenses  or the failure of the third party licensors to adequately maintain or update their products  could result in delay in the company s ability to ship certain of its products while it seeks to implement technology offered by alternative sources 
any required replacement licenses could prove costly 
also  any such delay  to the extent it becomes extended or occurs at or near the end of a fiscal quarter  could result in a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
while it may be necessary or desirable in the future to obtain other licenses relating to one or more of the company s products or relating to current or future technologies  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
in the future  the company may receive notices claiming that it is infringing the proprietary rights of third parties  and there can be no assurance that the company will not become the subject of infringement claims or legal proceedings by third parties with respect to current or future products 
in addition  the company may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of the company s proprietary rights or to establish the validity of the company s proprietary rights 
any such claim could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or force the company to enter into royalty or license agreements rather than dispute the merits of such claims 
moreover  an adverse outcome in litigation or similar adversarial proceedings could subject the company to significant liabilities to third parties  require the expenditure of significant resources to develop non infringing technology  require disputed rights to be licensed from others  or require the company to cease the marketing or use of certain products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
to the extent the company desires or is required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others  there can be no assurance that any such licenses will be made available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
as the number of software products in the industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps  the company believes the software developers may become increasingly subject to infringement claims 
any such claims against the company  with or without merit  as well as claims initiated by the company against third parties  could be time consuming and expensive to defend  prosecute or resolve 
employees as of december   the company had employees  of which were located in the united states 
the company has never had a work stoppage and none of its employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement 
the company believes its relations with its employees are good 
the company s future operating results depend in significant part upon the continued service of its key technical and senior management personnel 
the company s future success also depends on its continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will retain its key managerial or technical personnel or that it can attract  assimilate and retain such personnel in the future 
the company has at times experienced  and continues to experience  difficulty recruiting qualified personnel  and there can be no assurance that the company will not experience such difficulties in the future 
the company actively recruits qualified product development  consulting  sales and marketing personnel 
if the company is unable to hire and retain qualified personnel in the future  such inability could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition

item legal proceedings jda is periodically involved in legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business 
although there can be no assurance  management does not believe that the disposition of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in may  niederhoffer and niederhoffer  inc niederhoffer filed a demand for arbitration asserting a claim against jda software services  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
niederhoffer s claims are based upon an agreement between it and jda software services  inc dated april  niederhoffer alleged entitlement to a finder s fee in connection with the purchase of convertible preferred stock in the company in march by six investment funds advised by ta associates  inc and its affiliates  and a claim for jda common stock arising from the related establishment of the company and reorganization of the company s wholly owned subsidiaries pursuant to which jda common stock was issued to such subsidiaries stockholders

certain of jda s predecessor companies did  however  pay dividends to their s corporation stockholders 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
since jda s initial public offering on march   the market price of its common stock has experienced large fluctuations and may continue to be volatile in the future 
factors such as future announcements concerning the company or its competitors  quarterly variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations  the introduction of new products or changes in product pricing policies by the company or its competitors  proprietary rights or other litigation  changes in earnings estimates by analysts or other factors could cause the market price of jda s common stock to fluctuate substantially 
further  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have affected the market price for many high technology companies and which  on occasion  have been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies 
these fluctuations  as well as the general economic  market and political conditions both domestically and internationally  including recessions or military conflicts  may materially and adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview jda software group  inc jda or the company is a leading international provider of integrated enterprise wide software products and services that address mission critical management information needs of the retail supply chain 
the company s products include merchandising  financial and decision support systems at the corporate level  point of sale  back office and distributed processing applications at the store level  and warehouse management and logistics systems at the distribution level 
jda also offers a wide range of professional services through its consulting and customer support organizations  including project management  system planning  design and implementation  custom modifications  training and support services 
in  the company introduced mms  its first enterprise retail information solution  based on the ibm as platform 
the company s development efforts through were focused exclusively on enhancements  revisions and upgrades to mms  which is currently in its fourth generation release 
in  the company acquired dss  an in store system  from jda software services ltd 
jda canada  a then unaffiliated canadian company 
since  the company has significantly increased its product development expenditures to develop products for open platforms 
as a result of these efforts  the company commercially released odbms  an open client server enterprise system  in september  and win dss  a windows based in store system  in january the company also released retail ideas  a data warehouse system  in january and acquired wcc  a client server warehouse automation and management system  in connection with the acquisition of liocs corporation liocs in april jda has historically derived the majority of its revenues from software licenses and consulting  maintenance and other services relating to mms 
total revenues from the mms product line represented of the company s total revenues during  as compared with and in and  respectively 
although the company expects mms revenues to continue to represent a significant portion of total revenues for the foreseeable future  mms revenues as a percentage of total revenues may continue to decline as a result of the increased revenues attributable to the company s newer product lines  particularly odbms and win dss 
software license revenues and consulting  maintenance and other services revenues represented and  respectively  of jda s total revenues during  as compared with and  respectively  in both and consulting  maintenance and other services revenues are derived from a range of services  including system design and implementation and  to a lesser extent  software maintenance and support  and training 
during the past two years  the company has accelerated the growth of its services organization in anticipation of an increased mix of consulting  maintenance and other services revenues in both domestic and international markets  and continued market acceptance of its newer client server product lines  which require longer implementation cycles 
the company believes its ability to offer a wide range of professional services provides it with a competitive advantage as well as additional revenue streams 
consulting  maintenance and other services revenues are generally more predictable and generate significantly lower gross margins than software revenues 
in addition  consulting  maintenance and other services costs tend to be higher during periods of rapid expansion  particularly with the opening of new international offices where initial recruiting costs  training and other start up expenses must be incurred in advance of anticipated revenues  and as a result of the reduced labor efficiencies associated with the introduction of products to a new customer base 
the company has pursued a strategy of addressing international markets by developing localized versions of its products and establishing international subsidiaries with direct sales and consulting capabilities 
international revenues  which include revenues from international subsidiaries and export sales  represented  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
consulting  maintenance and other services in support of international software licenses typically have lower gross margins than those achieved domestically due to generally lower prevailing billing rates and or higher costs in certain of the company s international markets 
therefore  significant growth in the company s international operations may result in further declines in gross margins on consulting  maintenance and other services 
the asia pacific region encountered unstable local economies and significant devaluation in its currencies during the last six months of and continuing into the economic situation in the region has resulted in slower payment of outstanding receivable balances and various requests for extended or modified payment terms 
this region represented less than of the company s revenues and less than of income from operations 
asia pacific receivables  net of reserves  were approximately of the company s total net receivables at december  to the extent the asia pacific region grows in importance to the company  or that the factors affecting the region begin to adversely affect retailers in other geographic locations  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
to the extent the company s international operations expand  the company expects that an increasing portion of its international license and consulting  maintenance and other services revenues will be denominated in foreign currencies  subjecting the company to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
historically  the company s operations have not been materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  and the company has not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions 
however  as the company continues to expand its international operations  exposures to gains and losses on foreign currency transactions may increase 
the company may choose to limit such exposure by entering into forward foreign exchange contracts or engaging in similar hedging strategies 
there can be no assurance that any currency exchange strategy would be successful in avoiding exchange related losses 
in addition  revenues of the company earned in various countries where the company does business may be subject to taxation by more than one jurisdiction  thereby adversely affecting the company s earnings 
prior to  the company recognized revenue in accordance with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop 
under sop  software license revenue is recognized upon the shipment of the product if collection is probable and the company s remaining obligations under the license agreement are insignificant 
consulting services are generally billed on an hourly basis and revenues are recognized as the work is performed 
maintenance revenues from ongoing customer support are billed on a monthly basis and recorded as revenue in the applicable month 
the aicpa has recently adopted statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop  that supersedes sop and becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after december  although the company does not believe that sop will have a significant impact on its financial statements  there can be no assurance that application and subsequent interpretations of this pronouncement by the company s independent auditors or the securities exchange commission will not modify the company s revenue recognition policies  or that such modifications would not have a material adverse effect on the operating results reported in any particular quarter 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to adopt changes in its licensing or services practices to conform to sop  or that such changes  will not result in delays or cancellations of potential sales of the company s products 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain selected financial information expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated and certain gross margin data expressed as a percentage of software licenses or consulting  maintenance and other services revenues  as appropriate years ended december  revenues software licenses consulting  maintenance and other services total revenues cost of revenues software licenses consulting  maintenance and other services total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses product development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations other income expense net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income pro forma statement of income data historical net income pro forma adjustment to adjust income tax provision pro forma net income gross margin on software licenses gross margin on consulting  maintenance and other services year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues total revenues for were million  an increase of over the million reported in revenues consist of software licenses and consulting  maintenance and other services  which represented and  respectively  of total revenues during  and and  respectively in software licenses 
software license revenues for were million  an increase of over the million reported in domestic and international software license revenues for increased and  respectively  over these increases resulted primarily from the company s expanded sales and marketing efforts worldwide  the incremental sales of the company s newer product lines such as odbms  win dss and retail ideas over the prior year  and an increase in average transaction size 
consulting  maintenance and other services 
consulting  maintenance and other services revenues for were million  an increase of over the million reported in this increase results from increased software license sales and the introduction of client server products that require longer installation cycles

consulting  maintenance and other services costs for were million  an increase of over the million reported in the company has expanded its consulting and customer support organizations as a result  and in anticipation of  increased sales of new software licenses and increased demand from the existing client base for additional support and professional services 
the company increased the number of personnel in its consulting  maintenance and other services organization by during  and as of december  the company had employees involved in these functions 
the company anticipates that the dollar amount of consulting  maintenance and other services will continue to increase as the company expands its operations 
gross profit gross profit for was million  an increase of over the million reported in gross profit as a percentage of total revenue decreased from in to in this decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in consulting  maintenance and other services revenues as a percentage of total revenues in in addition  the company s gross margin on consulting  maintenance and other services revenues decreased from in to in as a result of the rapid expansion of the consulting infrastructure  including high front end recruiting  training and downtime costs associated with the hiring of consultants during consulting  maintenance and other services margins were also reduced by the higher costs associated with the company s use of up to outside contractors in the united kingdom during the second half of to service the increased demand for installation work in that market 
the company s objective is to improve its consulting  maintenance and other services margins during by gradually replacing these contractors with full time staff and improving utilization rates and economies of scale  particularly with respect to the installation of the odbms client server product 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully improve consulting  maintenance and other services margins  and such margins could be materially  adversely affected if revenues were to fall short of expectations  or if other factors were to significantly affect the utilization rates of the service personnel 
the company currently anticipates that consulting  maintenance and other services revenues as a percentage of total revenues will increase in compared to  and accordingly  that overall gross profit as a percentage of total revenues will be reduced as a result of the significantly lower gross margins associated with consulting  maintenance and other services as compared to software licenses 
operating expenses product development 
product development expenses for were million  an increase of over the million reported in product development expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased from in to in the increase in absolute dollars resulted from increases in the company s product development staff to continue development efforts on odbms  win dss  retail ideas  and wcc  and to make further enhancements to the mms product line 
the company believes that a strong commitment to product development will be required in order to remain competitive 
jda has identified certain functions and design features in connection with early installations of odbms that it plans to add to the base code in order to shorten the deployment cycle and increase customer satisfaction 
the company currently expects product development expenses in to be between million and million as it incorporates these features into the odbms product and adds similar improvements to win dss and other product lines 
the company believes its current process for developing software is essentially completed concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility  and accordingly  no costs have been capitalized 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses for were million  an increase of over the million reported in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased from in to in the increase in absolute dollars results from the company s increased sales and marketing presence in both domestic and international markets

general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses for were million  an increase of over the million reported in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were and in and  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars results from the addition of administrative personnel to support the company s domestic and international growth and from a million increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts during  including million in specific reserves for receivables originating in the asia pacific region 
the company anticipates that general and administrative expenses may continue to increase in dollar amount as the company expands its operations 
provision for income taxes the company s effective income tax rate was for both and this rate reflects statutory federal  state and foreign tax rates  partially offset by a reduction for research and development expense tax credits 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues total revenues for were million  an increase of over the million in the increase in total revenues was primarily due to increases in software licenses resulting from expanded sales and marketing efforts both domestically and internationally  combined with increases in consulting  maintenance and other services from associated implementations

this increase in international revenues as a percentage of total revenues was primarily attributable to increased revenues in latin america  the pacific rim and europe resulting from the company s expanded sales and marketing efforts in those markets  including efforts in new geographic locations within those markets 
the increase in international revenues in was also the result of the acquisition of jda canada in august and the related increase in revenues in canada

general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by to million in from million in  representing and of total revenues in those periods  respectively

provision for income taxes the company s effective income tax rate was in the effective rate reflects statutory federal  state and foreign tax rates  partially offset by a reduction for research and development expense tax credits 
prior to march   certain of jda s predecessor companies elected s corporation status 
as a result  the company s statement of income for the first quarter of does not contain a provision for federal income taxes 
the consolidated statement of income reflects a pro forma adjustment for federal income taxes and an effective rate of 
liquidity and capital resources since its inception  the company has financed its operations primarily through cash generated from operations and public sales of equity securities and  to a lesser extent  borrowings under its bank line of credit 
the company had working capital of million at december  compared with million at december  cash and cash equivalents at december  were million  a decrease of million from the million reported at december  operating activities provided cash of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities decreased in primarily due to a million increase in accounts receivable  partially offset by a million increase in net income 
the company had net accounts receivable of million at december  which represented days of sales outstanding dsos 
dsos have historically been higher in the second and third quarters of each fiscal year  as a result  the company believes  of the seasonal cash flow requirements of its retail customers 
dsos may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis due to a number of factors including seasonality  shifts in customer buying patterns  the underlying mix of products and services  and the geographic concentration of revenues

any material acquisition or joint venture could result in a decrease to the company s working capital depending on the amount  timing and nature of the consideration to be paid 
the company maintains a million line of credit with a commercial bank 
the line of credit is collateralized by property and equipment  receivables  and intangibles  accrues interest at the bank s reference rate  which approximates prime  and requires the company to maintain certain current ratios and tangible net worth 
the line of credit matures on july   and the company intends to seek renewal at that time 
there were no amounts outstanding on the line of credit at december  the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents  available borrowings under the bank line of credit and funds generated from operations will provide adequate liquidity to meet the company s normal operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  any material acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies could require the company to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
year compliance many currently installed computer systems are not capable of distinguishing st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  in less than two years  computer systems and or software used by many companies in a very wide variety of applications will experience operating difficulties unless they are modified or upgraded to adequately process information involving  related to or dependent upon the century change 
significant uncertainty exists in the software and other industries concerning the scope and magnitude of problems associated with the century change 
the company recognizes the need to ensure its operations will not be adversely impacted by year software failures and has established a project team to assess year risks 
the project team will coordinate the identification and implementation of changes to computer hardware and software applications that will ensure availability and integrity of the company s financial systems and the reliability of its operational systems 
the company is also assessing the potential overall impact of the impending century change on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
based on the company s assessment to date  the company believes its current versions of its software products and services are year compliant  that is  they are capable of adequately distinguishing st century dates from th century dates 
however  the company believes some of the company s customers are running earlier versions of the company s software products that are not year compliant  and the company has been encouraging such customers to migrate to current product versions 
moreover  the company s products are generally integrated into enterprise systems involving complicated software products developed by other vendors 
the company may in the future be subject to claims based on year problems in others products  custom modifications made by third parties to the company s products  or issues arising from the integration of multiple products within an overall system 
although the company has not been a party to any litigation or arbitration proceeding to date involving its products or services and related to year compliance issues  there can be no assurance that the company will not in the future be required to defend its products or services in such proceedings  or to negotiate resolutions of claims based on year issues 
the costs of defending and resolving year related disputes  and any liability of the company for year related damages  including consequential damages  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company is currently reviewing its internal management information and other systems in order to identify and modify those products  services or systems that are not year compliant 
the total cost of these year compliance activities has not been  and is not anticipated to be  material to the company s financial condition or its operating results 
these costs and the timing in which the company plans to complete its year modification and testing processes are based on management s best estimates 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will timely identify and remediate all significant year problems  that remedial efforts will not involve significant time and expense  or that such problems will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company also faces risk to the extent that suppliers of products  services and systems purchased by the company and others with whom the company transacts business on a worldwide basis do not comply with year requirements 
in the event any such third parties cannot timely provide the company with products  services or systems that meet the year requirements on a timely basis  or in the event year issues prevent such third parties from timely delivery of products or services required by the company  the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected 
also  no assurance can be given that year problems within the company s prospective customer base of retail organizations will not result in the deferral or cancellation of such organizations decisions to license and implement information systems such as those offered by the company 
to the extent year issues cause significant delays in  or cancellation of  decisions to purchase the company s products or services  the company s business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
certain risks variability in quarterly operating results 
the company s quarterly operating results have varied and are expected to continue to vary in the future 
these fluctuations may be caused by many factors  including demand for the company s products and services  the size and timing of individual sales  the lengthening of the company s sales cycle  competitive pricing pressures  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products  changes in the mix of products and services sold  the timing of introductions and enhancements of products by the company or its competitors  market acceptance of new products  technological changes in platforms supporting the company s products  changes in the company s operating expenses  changes in the mix of domestic and international revenues  the company s ability to complete fixed price consulting contracts within budget  personnel changes  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  expansion of international operations  changes in the company s strategies  and general industry and economic conditions 
the company s business has experienced  and is expected to continue to experience  some degree of seasonality due in large part to its retail customers buying cycles 
specifically  software license revenues have been higher in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
further  the gross margin on software licenses is significantly greater than the gross margin on consulting  maintenance and other services 
as a result  the company s gross margin has fluctuated from quarter to quarter and  management expects  may continue to fluctuate significantly based on revenue mix and seasonality 
the company s software products typically ship when contracts are signed 
consequently  license backlog at the beginning of any quarter has represented only a small portion of that quarter s expected revenues 
as a result  software license revenues in any quarter are difficult to forecast because such revenues are substantially dependent on agreements executed and the related shipment of software in that quarter 
moreover  the company typically recognizes a substantial amount of its revenues in the last weeks or days of the quarter 
the company generally derives a significant portion of its quarterly software license revenues from a small number of relatively large sales 
the timing of large individual sales is difficult to predict  and in some cases  large individual sales have occurred in quarters subsequent to those originally anticipated by the company 
the company anticipates that the foregoing trends will continue 
any significant cancellation or deferral of customer orders  or the company s inability to conclude license negotiations in the compressed time frame at the end of a fiscal quarter may have a material adverse effect on its operating results reported in any particular quarter 
further  the company s expense levels are based on its expectations of future revenues 
since sales of software licenses are typically accompanied by a significant amount of consulting  implementation and support services  the company s consulting and support resources must be managed to meet anticipated license revenues 
as a result  service personnel are generally hired and trained in advance of anticipated license revenues 
if revenues were to fall short of expectations  or if other factors were to significantly affect the utilization rates of service personnel  the operating results reported in any particular quarter are likely to be adversely affected because a significant portion of the company s expenses are not variable in the short term  and cannot be quickly reduced to respond to any unexpected revenue shortfall 
prior to  the company recognized revenue in accordance with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop 
the aicpa has recently adopted statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop  that supersedes sop and becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after december  although the company does not believe that sop will have a significant impact on its financial statements  there can be no assurance that application and subsequent interpretations of this pronouncement by the company s independent auditors or the securities exchange commission will not modify the company s revenue recognition policies  or that such modifications would not have a material adverse effect on the operating results reported in any particular quarter 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to adopt changes in its licensing or services practices to conform to sop  or that such changes  if adopted  would not result in delays or cancellations of potential sales of the company s products 
based on all of the foregoing  the company believes that future revenues  expenses and operating results are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
as a result  quarter to quarter comparisons of operating results are not necessarily meaningful or indicative of future performance 
furthermore  the company believes it is likely that in some future quarter the company s operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
in such event  or in the event that adverse conditions prevail  or are perceived to prevail  with respect to the company s business  or generally  the market price of the company s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
dependence on retail industry 
the company has derived substantially all of its revenues to date from the license of software products and related services to the retail industry  and its future growth is critically dependent on increased sales to the retail industry 
the success of the company s customers is intrinsically linked to economic conditions in the retail industry  which in turn are subject to intense competitive pressures and are affected by overall economic conditions 
in addition  the company believes the license of its software products is relatively discretionary and generally involves a significant commitment of capital  which is often accompanied by large scale hardware purchases or commitments 
as a result  although the company believes its products can assist retailers in a competitive environment  demand for the company s products and services could be adversely affected by instability or downturns in the retail industry which may cause customers to exit the industry or delay  cancel or reduce any planned expenditures for information management systems and software products 
the company also believes that the retail industry is experiencing a period of increased consolidation  which has in the past and may in the future affect the demand for the company s products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue its revenue growth or sustain its profitability on a quarterly or annual basis or that its results of operations will not be adversely affected by future downturns in the retail industry 
any resulting decline in demand for the company s products and services would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
management of growth 
the company s business has grown rapidly in recent years  with revenues increasing from million in to million in to million in the company s recent expansion has resulted in substantial growth in the number of its employees  the scope of its operating systems and the geographic distribution of its operations and customers 
this recent rapid growth has placed  and if continued will continue to place  a significant strain on the company s management and operations 
the company s ability to compete effectively and to manage future growth  if any  will depend on its ability to continue to implement and improve operational  financial and management information systems on a timely basis  to expand  train  motivate and manage its work force  in particular its direct sales force and consulting services organization  and to deal effectively with third party systems integrators and consultants 
several of the company s executive management personnel have only recently joined the company 
in addition  brent w 
lippman has only recently assumed the role of chief executive officer 
the company s future growth and success depends in significant part upon the ability of the company s executive management team to effectively manage the expansion of the company s operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage its recent or any future growth  and any failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company anticipates that continued growth  if any  will require it to recruit and hire a substantial number of new employees  including consulting and product development personnel  both domestically and abroad 
the company s ability to undertake new projects and increase revenues is substantially dependent on the availability of consulting personnel to assist in the design  planning and implementation of the company s solutions 
consequently  the company will not be able to continue to increase its business at historical rates without adding significant numbers of trained consulting personnel 
moreover  in the event the company is unable to sufficiently increase its consulting capacity  the company may be required to forego licensing opportunities or become increasingly dependent on systems integrators and professional consulting firms to provide implementation services for its products 
therefore  in anticipation of increasing its business the company continues to significantly increase its consulting capacity 
however  to the extent anticipated revenues fail to materialize following the hiring and training of new personnel  the company s operating results would be adversely affected 
the addition of significant numbers of new personnel requires the company to incur significant start up expenses  including procurement of office space and equipment  initial training costs and low utilization rates of new personnel 
such start up expenses have in the past contributed  and may in the future contribute  to significant reductions in gross margin on consulting  maintenance and other services revenues and on overall gross margin 
there can be no assurance that start up expenses incurred in connection with the hiring of additional technical personnel would not result in a material adverse impact on the company s future operating results 
ability to attract and retain technical personnel 
the company is heavily dependent upon its ability to attract  retain and motivate skilled technical and managerial personnel  especially highly skilled engineers involved in ongoing product development and consulting personnel who assist in the design  planning and implementation of the company s solutions 
in particular  the company s ability to install  maintain and enhance its products is substantially dependent upon its ability to locate  hire  train and retain qualified software engineers 
the market for such individuals is intensely competitive  particularly in international markets 
in this regard  as part of its strategy  the company plans to significantly increase the number of consulting personnel in connection with the continuing roll out of its client server products and to support further development and implementation of mms 
given the critical roles of the company s product development and consulting staffs  the inability to recruit successfully or the loss of a significant part of its product development or consulting staffs would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the software industry is characterized by a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting of skilled personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain its current personnel  or that it will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future 
the inability to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
limited deployment of and uncertain market for new software products 
the company s newer software products  odbms  win dss  retail ideas and wcc  which are designed for open client server environments  have all been commercially released within the last months 
to date  only a limited number of customers have licensed or implemented the company s client server products 
the market for these products is new and evolving  and the company believes that retailers may generally be more cautious than other businesses in adopting client server technologies 
consequently  it is difficult to assess or predict with any assurance the growth rate  if any  and size of the market for the company s client server products and there can be no assurance that this market will continue to develop 
potential and existing customers may find it difficult  or be unable  to successfully implement the company s client server products  or may not purchase such products for a variety of reasons  including the customer s inability to obtain hardware  software  networking infrastructure  or sufficient internal staff required to implement  operate and maintain an open client server solution  the generally longer time periods and greater cost required to implement such products as compared to ibm as based products  and limited implementation experience with such products by the company s service personnel or third party implementation providers 
furthermore  the company must overcome significant obstacles to successfully market its client server solutions  including limited experience of the company s sales and consulting personnel in the client server market and limited existing reference accounts in this market 
if the market for the company s client server products fails to develop  develops more slowly than expected or becomes saturated with competitors  or if the company s products do not achieve market acceptance  the company s business  operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
product concentration 
the company has historically derived the majority of its revenues from software licenses and consulting  maintenance and other services related to mms 
mms revenues are in part dependent on continued vitality of and support by ibm of its as platform 
although the company expects mms revenues to continue to represent a significant portion of total revenues for the foreseeable future  mms revenues as a percentage of total revenues may continue to decline as a result of the increased revenues attributable to the company s newer software products  particularly odbms and win dss 
the life cycle of the mms product line is difficult to estimate due largely to the potential effect of new products  applications and product enhancements  including those introduced by the company  changes in the retail industry and future competition 
any decline in mms revenues  as a result of competition  technological change  a decline in the market for or support of the ibm as platform  or other factors  to the extent not offset by increases in revenues from other products  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that prospective purchasers of the company s ibm as based products will respond favorably to the company s future or enhanced software products or that the company will continue to be successful in selling its software products or services in the ibm as market 
international operations 
the company s international revenues  which include revenues from international subsidiaries and export sales  represented  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the company expects that international revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of the company s revenues for the foreseeable future 
the company anticipates that continued growth of its international operations will require the company to recruit and hire a number of new consulting  sales and marketing and support personnel in the countries in which the company has established or will establish offices 
in addition  the company has only limited experience in developing localized versions of its products and in marketing and distributing its products internationally 
international introductions of the company s products often require significant investment by the company in advance of anticipated future revenues 
the opening of new offices by the company typically results in initial recruiting and training expenses and reduced labor efficiencies associated with the introduction of products to a new market 
there can be no assurance that the countries in which the company operates will have a sufficient pool of qualified personnel from which the company may hire  or that the company will be successful at hiring  training or retaining such personnel 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully localize  market  sell and deliver its products internationally 
the inability of the company to successfully expand its international operations in a timely manner could materially adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s international business operations are subject to risks inherent in international activities  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  longer accounts receivable payment cycles in certain countries  potentially adverse tax consequences  difficulties in staffing and managing geographically disparate operations  greater difficulty in safeguarding intellectual property  licensing and other trade restrictions  currency fluctuations  repatriation of earnings  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws  and general economic conditions in international markets 
in addition  consulting  maintenance and other services in support of international licenses typically have lower gross margins than those achieved domestically due to generally lower prevailing billing rates and or higher costs in certain of the company s international markets 
accordingly  any planned growth in the company s international operations may result in further declines in gross margins on consulting  maintenance and other services 
to the extent the company s international operations expand  the company expects that an increasing portion of its international license and consulting  maintenance and other services revenues will be denominated in foreign currencies  subjecting the company to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not currently engage in foreign currency hedging transactions 
however  as the company continues to expand its international operations  exposures to gains and losses on foreign currency transactions may increase 
the company may choose to limit such exposure by entering into forward foreign exchange contracts or engaging in similar hedging strategies 
there can be no assurance that any currency exchange strategy would be successful in avoiding exchange related losses 
in addition  revenues of the company earned in various countries where the company does business may be subject to taxation by more than one jurisdiction  thereby adversely affecting the company s earnings 
the asia pacific region encountered unstable local economies and significant devaluation in its currencies during the last six months of and continuing into the economic situation in the region has resulted in slower payments of outstanding receivable balances and various requests for extended or modified payment terms 
to date  this region has not represented a significant portion of the company s revenues 
however  to the extent the asia pacific region grows in importance to the company  or that the factors affecting the region begin to adversely affect retailers in other geographic locations  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
competition 
the markets for retail information systems are highly competitive 
the company believes the principal competitive factors in such markets are product quality  reliability  performance and price  vendor and product reputation  retail industry expertise  financial stability  features and functions  ease of use and quality of support 
a number of companies offer competitive products addressing certain of the company s target markets 
in the enterprise systems market  the company competes with internally developed systems and with third party developers such as intrepid  island pacific  radius plc  retek a subsidiary of hnc software  inc  sts systems and richter management services 
in addition  the company believes that new market entrants may attempt to develop fully integrated enterprise level systems targeting the retail industry 
in particular  sap ag has announced the availability of an integrated client server enterprise system competitive with the company s products 
in addition  intrepid has announced the formation of a joint development and marketing relationship with peoplesoft  inc  a provider of enterprise applications software  to develop products that are expected to compete directly with odbms 
in the in store systems market  which is more fragmented than the enterprise systems market  the company competes with major hardware original equipment manufacturers such as icl  ncr  and ibm  as well as software companies such as crs business computers  datavantage  sts systems  trimax and gers retail systems 
in the distribution and warehouse management systems market  the company s wcc product competes with products from catalyst international  inc  exe and mchugh freeman 
the retail ideas product competes with products from microstrategy and intrepid  among other vendors 
in the market for consulting services  the company is pursuing a strategy of forming informal working relationships with leading retail systems integrators such as andersen consulting and ernst young llp 
these integrators  as well as independent consulting firms such as ibm global services division  also represent potential competition to the company s consulting services group 
many of the company s existing competitors  as well as a number of potential new competitors  have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than the company  each of which could provide them with a significant competitive advantage over the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against its current or future competitors or that competition would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
risks associated with strategic relationships 
the company has from time to time established formal and informal relationships with other companies  including ibm and silvon  inc  involving collaboration in areas such as product development  marketing and distribution 
the maintenance of these relationships and the development of other such relationships is a meaningful part of the company s business strategy 
currently  the company s relationship with ibm is cooperative in that there is no written agreement defining the parties obligations 
there can be no assurance that the company s current informal relationships will be beneficial to the company  that such relationships will be sustained  or that the company will be able to enter into successful new strategic relationships in the future 
lengthy implementation process  fixed price service contracts 
the company s software products are complex and perform or directly affect business critical functions across many different functional and geographic areas of the enterprise 
consequently  implementation of the company s software is a complex  lengthy process that involves a significant commitment of resources by the company s customers and that is subject to a number of significant risks over which the company has little or no control 
the company expects that implementation of the client server versions of its products is likely to be more complex and requires more time than implementation of its dos and ibm as based products 
in addition  the company s lack of experience in implementing its client server based products may contribute to the length of the implementation process 
delays in the completion of implementations of any of its software products whether by the company or its business partners  may result in customer dissatisfaction or damage to the company s reputation and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company offers a combination of software products  implementation and support services to its customers 
typically  the company enters into service agreements with its customers that provide for consulting and implementation services on a time and expenses basis 
certain customers have asked for  and the company has from time to time entered into  fixed price service contracts 
these contracts specify certain milestones to be met by the company regardless of actual costs incurred by the company in fulfilling those obligations 
the company believes that fixed price service contracts may increasingly be offered by its competitors to differentiate their product and service offerings 
as result  the company may enter into more fixed price contracts in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company can successfully complete these contracts on budget  and the company s inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on its business  operating results and financial condition 
technological change and market acceptance of evolving standards 
the computer software industry is subject to rapid technological change  changing customer requirements  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards that may render existing products and services obsolete 
as a result  the company s position in its existing markets  or other markets that it may enter  could be eroded rapidly by technological advancements not embraced by the company 
the life cycles of the company s products are difficult to estimate 
the products must keep pace with technological developments  conform to evolving industry standards and address increasingly sophisticated customer needs 
in particular  the company believes that it must continue to respond quickly to users needs for broad functionality and multi platform support and to advances in hardware and operating systems 
introduction of new products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render the company s products obsolete and unmarketable 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience future difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of new products  or that new products and product enhancements will meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance 
if the company is unable to develop and introduce products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  the company s business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
dependence on proprietary technology 
the company s success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon its proprietary technology  including its software source code 
to protect its proprietary technology  the company relies on a combination of trade secret  nondisclosure and copyright law  which may afford only limited protection 
in addition  effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
the company presently has no patents or patent applications pending 
the source code for the company s proprietary software is protected both as a trade secret and as a copyrighted work 
although the company relies on the limited protection afforded by such intellectual property laws  it also believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel  new product developments  frequent product enhancements  name recognition and reliable maintenance are also essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position 
the company generally enters into confidentiality or license agreements with its employees  consultants and customers  and generally controls access to and distribution of its software  documentation and other proprietary information 
the terms of the company s license agreements with its customers often require the company to provide the customer with a listing of the product source code 
although the license agreements place restrictions on the use by the customer of the company s source code and do not permit the re sale  sublicense or other transfer of such source code  there can be no assurance that unauthorized use of the company s technology will not occur 
despite the measures taken by the company to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to reverse engineer or copy aspects of the company s products or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of the company s products is difficult 
in addition  litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce the company s intellectual property rights  to protect the company s trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
certain technology used by the company s products is licensed from third parties  generally on a non exclusive basis 
these licenses generally require the company to pay royalties and fulfill confidentiality obligations 
the company believes that alternative resources exist for each of the material components of technology licensed by the company from third parties 
however  the termination of any such licenses  or the failure of the third party licensors to adequately maintain or update their products  could result in delay in the company s ability to sell certain of its products while it seeks to implement technology offered by alternative sources 
any required replacement licenses could prove costly 
also  any such delay  to the extent it becomes extended or occurs at or near the end of a fiscal quarter  could result in a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
while it may be necessary or desirable in the future to obtain other licenses relating to one or more of the company s products or relating to current or future technologies  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
in the future  the company may receive notices claiming that it is infringing the proprietary rights of third parties  and there can be no assurance that the company will not become the subject of infringement claims or legal proceedings by third parties with respect to current or future products 
in addition  the company may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of the company s proprietary rights or to establish the validity of the company s proprietary rights 
any such claim could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or force the company to enter into royalty or license agreements rather than dispute the merits of such claims 
moreover  an adverse outcome in litigation or similar adversarial proceedings could subject the company to significant liabilities to third parties  require the expenditure of significant resources to develop non infringing technology  require disputed rights to be licensed from others or require the company to cease the marketing or use of certain products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
to the extent the company desires or is required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others  there can be no assurance that any such licenses will be made available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
as the number of software products in the industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps  the company believes the software developers may become increasingly subject to infringement claims 
any such claims against the company  with or without merit  as well as claims initiated by the company against third parties  could be time consuming and expensive to defend  prosecute or resolve 
product defects  product liability  risk of integration difficulties 
the company s software products are highly complex and sophisticated and could  from time to time  contain design defects or software errors that could be difficult to detect and correct 
in addition  implementation of the company s products generally involves a significant amount of customer specific customization  and may involve integration with systems developed by third parties 
in particular  it is common for complex software programs  such as the company s newer  client server software products  to contain undetected errors when first released which are discovered only after the product has been implemented and used over time with different computer systems and in a variety of applications and environments 
despite extensive testing  the company from time to time has discovered defects or errors in its products or custom modifications only after its systems have been used by many customers 
in addition  the company or its customers may from time to time experience difficulties integrating the company s products with other hardware or software in the customer s environment that are unrelated to defects in the company s products 
there can be no assurance that errors in the company s software products will not be discovered or  if discovered  that they will be successfully be corrected on a timely basis  if at all 
further  there can be no assurance that such defects  errors or difficulties will not cause future delays in product introductions and shipments  result in increased costs and diversion of development resources  require design modifications or impair customer satisfaction with the company s products 
the company s future business growth is substantially dependent on the continued development of market acceptance of its newer  client server products 
if customers experience significant problems with implementation of the company s client server products or are otherwise dissatisfied with the functionality or performance of such products  or if such products fail to achieve market acceptance for any reason  the company s business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
since the company s products may be used by its customers to perform mission critical functions  design defects  software errors  misuse of the company s products  incorrect data from external sources or other potential problems within or out of the company s control that may arise from the use of the company s products could result in financial or other damages to the company s customers 
prior to  the company did not maintain product liability insurance 
although the company s license agreements with its customers typically contain provisions designed to limit the company s exposure to potential claims as well as any liabilities arising from such claims  such provisions may not effectively protect the company against such claims and the liability and costs associated therewith 
accordingly  any such claim could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s performance is substantially dependent on the continued performance of its executive officers and other key employees  particularly the performance and services of brent w 
lippman  the company s chief executive officer 
the company does not have in place key person life insurance policies on any of its employees 
the loss of the services of mr 
lippman or other key executive officers or employees could have a material adverse effect on the business  operating results and financial condition of the company 
volatility of market price 
the market price of the company s common stock has experienced large fluctuations which may be expected to continue 
future announcements concerning the company or its competitors  quarterly variations in operating results  accounts receivable balances or aging  announcements of technological innovations  the introduction of new products or changes in product pricing policies by the company or its competitors  proprietary rights or other litigation  changes in earnings estimates by analysts or other factors could cause the market price of the company s common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  stock prices for many technology companies have fluctuated widely for reasons  which have often been unrelated to the operating results of such companies 
these fluctuations  as well as general economic  market and political conditions such as recessions or military conflicts  may materially and adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
potential future acquisitions 
one of the company s strategies is to pursue acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies  or enter into joint venture arrangements that could complement or expand the company s business 
the negotiation of potential acquisitions or joint ventures as well as the integration of an acquired business  product or technology could cause diversion of management s time and resources 
future acquisitions by the company could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence by the company of debt and contingent liabilities  amortization of goodwill and other intangibles  research and development write offs and other acquisition related expenses 
no assurances can be given that any acquired business will be successfully integrated with the company s operations  or that the company will receive the intended benefits of such acquisition 
future acquisitions  whether or not consummated  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition
