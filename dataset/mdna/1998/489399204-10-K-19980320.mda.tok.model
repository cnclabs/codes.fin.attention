year compliance the inability of computers  software and other equipment utilizing microprocessors to recognize and properly process information containing a digit year is commonly referred to as the year compliance issue 
as the year approaches  such systems may be unable to accurately process certain date based information 
as the company principally relies on third party vendors for its applications  the company has communicated with other companies whom it does significant business to determine their year compliance readiness and the extent to which the company is vulnerable to any third party year issues 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with company s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the total cost to the company of these year compliance activities has not been determined and is not anticipated to be material to its financial position or results of operations in any given year 
these costs and the date on which the company plans to complete the year modifications and testing processes are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that the estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ from those plans 
liquidity and capital resources the company believes that cash and cash equivalents at december  of million  plus expected cash generated from ongoing real estate marketing operations  continued sales of real estate owned  collections from notes receivable  as well as a working capital line of credit  will provide the company with sufficient resources to fund its present and reasonably foreseeable operations 
the company has not historically required major capital expenditures to support its marketing operations 
however  the company believes that its ability to make advances to its clients marketing budgets provides a competitive advantage 
the company s liquidity may in the future be adversely affected by lower commission rates  or increased contributions to marketing budgets  caused by competition from other marketing companies 
liquidity could also be adversely affected by the company s ability to sell real estate it has acquired 
as discussed in notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company is obligated under various notes payable and mortgages payable  which are secured by notes receivable and real estate held for sale 
approximately million of notes payable and  of mortgages are due in the company anticipates that these amounts will be repaid from proceeds from the sale of the related collateral 
to the extent the company engages in additional strategic investments  including real estate and note portfolio acquisitions  the company may need to obtain third party financing which could include bank financing or the public sale or private placement of debt or equity securities 
the company has historically been successful in arranging the required financing for its investment activities 
the increase in in the company s acquisition line of credit to million  the additional lines of credit secured in  and the bank financing obtained for acquisitions  support the company s belief that it should be able to continue to secure the capital resources necessary to fund its investments 
see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements
