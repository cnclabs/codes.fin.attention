year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
the company s computer equipment  software  devices and products with imbedded technology that are time sensitive may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a shut down in the company s manufacturing operations  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
state of readiness the company has undertaken various initiatives to evaluate the year readiness of the products sold by the company products  the information technology systems used in the company s operations it systems  its non it systems  such as power to its facilities  hvac systems  building security  voicemail and other systems  as well as the readiness of its customers and suppliers 
the company has identified eleven year target areas that cover the entire scope of the company s business and has internally established a teams committed to completing an step compliance validation process cvp for each target area 
the team is expected to fully complete this process on or before september  the table below identifies the company s target areas as well as the step cvp with its expected timeline 
although some phase remediation activities have been started or completed  most team activity is currently focused towards the process of completing phase year target areas compliance validation process phase business computer systems team formation expected completion technical infrastructure inventory assessment end user computing compliance assessment end of q fiscal manufacturing equipment risk assessment test lab telecommunications phase research development logistics resolution remediation expected completion facilities validation customers contingency plan end of q fiscal suppliers key service providers sign off acceptance with respect to the company s relationships with third parties  the company relies both domestically and internationally upon various vendors  governmental agencies  utility companies  telecommunications service companies  delivery service companies and other service providers 
although these service providers are outside of the company s control  the company is in the process of mailing letters to those with whom its believes its relationships are material and is verbally communicating with some of its strategic customers and vendors to determine the extent to which interfaces with such entities are vulnerable to year issues and whether products and services purchased from or by such entities are year ready 
the company intends to complete follow up activities  including but not limited to site surveys  phone surveys and mailings  with significant vendors and service providers as part of the phase validation 
costs to address year issues to date  the company has not incurred any material expenditures in connection with identifying or evaluating year compliance issues 
the company has incurred the majority of its costs from the recent installation of an update to its business computer system consisting primarily of year software upgrades as well as the opportunity cost of time spent by employees of the company evaluating year compliance matters 
because the company did not accelerate the installation of the software upgrades  it does not consider the costs related thereto to be charges for year compliance 
presently  the company does not have specific estimates for the cost of other upgrades and enhancements to its it systems but will provide such by the completion of phase when they are expected to be available 
the company does anticipate that these estimates will be reasonable and presently expects such to be within the company s fiscal budget 
at this time  the company does not possess information necessary to estimate the potential financial impact of year compliance issues relating to its non it systems  products  vendors  customers and other third parties 
such impact  including the effect of a year business disruption  could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
risks of year issues because the company is still in the discovery and evaluation phase of assessing its overall year exposure  it cannot at this time state with certainty that the year issues will not have a material adverse impact on its financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
although the company considers them unlikely  the company believes that the following several situations  not in any particular order  make up the company s most reasonably likely worst case year scenarios disruption of a significant customer s ability to accept products or pay invoices the company s significant customers are large  well informed customers  mostly in the surface mount technology and printing industries  who are disclosing information to their vendors that indicates they are well along the path toward year compliance 
these customers have demonstrated their awareness of the year issue by issuing requirements of their suppliers and indicating the stages of identification and remediation which they consider adequate for progressive calendar quarters leading up to the century mark 
the company s significant customers  moreover  are substantial companies that the company believes would be able to make adjustments in their processes as required to cause timely payment of invoices 
disruption of supply materials the company is in the process of surveying its vendors with regard to their year readiness  and will assess and catalog the responses to the survey 
the company is hopeful of receiving adequate responses from critical vendors and many non critical vendors within the first two quarters of fiscal the company expects to work with vendors that show a need for assistance or that provide inadequate responses  and in many cases expects that survey results will be refined significantly by such work 
where ultimate survey results show that the need arises  the company will arrange for back up vendors before the changeover date 
disruption of the company s it systems the company has completed a scheduled upgrade of its current business software systems to be year compliant 
year testing of end user computing hardware and software will occur sometime during fiscal for this reason  the company considers that disruption of its it systems is unlikely 
disruption of the company s non it systems the company is currently conducting a comprehensive assessment of all non it systems  including among other things its manufacturing systems and operations  with respect to both embedded processors and obvious computer control 
for some systems  upgrades are already scheduled and it is expected that the phase assessments will highlight by the end of the second quarter of fiscal any further remediation needs 
considering the nature of the equipment and systems involved  the company expects that the timing of assessment to be such that it will be able to complete any remediation efforts on a reasonably short schedule  and in any case before arrival of the year the company also believes that  after such assessment and remediation  if any disruptions do occur  such will be dealt with promptly and will be no more severe with respect to correction or impact than would be an unexpected breakdown of well maintained equipment 
contingency plans while the company recognizes the need for contingency planning  it has not yet developed any specific contingency plans for potential year disruptions 
the aforementioned step compliance validation process  however  does include contingency planning by the team and such plans  as developed  will be carefully reviewed by the company 
the company does anticipate developing contingency plans for its most critical areas  but details of such plans will depend on the company s final assessment of the problem as well as the evaluation and success of its remediation efforts 
future disclosures will include contingency plans as they become available 
changes in personnel a vice president of the company who was responsible for the company s year compliance efforts  among other matters  retired from the company in the third quarter of fiscal with respect to covering the company s year issues  the company has replaced this former employee with a senior level manager who is familiar with the technological issues and challenges involved with the year and who has accepted both responsibility and authority for all aspects of the company s compliance 
regarding the year  the company s new operations manager  who serves as the company s year compliance manger  reports directly to the company s president and chief executive officer and works closely with legal and  where needed  technical advisors
