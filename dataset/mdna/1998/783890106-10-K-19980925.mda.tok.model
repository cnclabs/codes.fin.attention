outsourcing of manufacturing services continued to gain momentum as a major trend 
finished product assembly accounted for approximately one half of fiscal year sales 
the company s mexican operations had substantial sales growth in due to higher customer demands for its lower cost manufacturing operations 
this growth  together with improving european markets  accounted for larger percentage growth in foreign sales than domestic sales

the company operates principally in the electronics manufacturing services ems industry 
it serves the same and similar customers in its domestic and foreign businesses 
the company s management views geographically organized divisions not only as individual operating entities  but as elements of strategic global relationships 
thus  the geographic data presented in note g to the company s consolidated financial statements  incorporated herein by reference  is not considered equitable as to the effect each geographic unit has on consolidated operating results

capital resources and liquidity both june  s working capital and current ratio remained at approximately the same levels as at june  working capital was million at june   and million at june  current ratio was at both june  and june  s available liquidity was million  comprised of million in unused credit facilities and million in cash 
the company believes that existing liquidity is sufficient to support near term growth 
fiscal year s capital expenditures are currently estimated to approximate depreciation and amortization expense of approximately million 
however  if market and competitive conditions change from those currently anticipated  the company may increase or decrease the capital expenditure level 
the company s board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of the company s outstanding stock  and up to million of outstanding convertible subordinated notes 
any such purchases would be funded from available liquidity 
any repurchases will be subject to market prices and other conditions 
inflationary trends are not expected to have a material impact on operations as relatively high asset turnover and sizable fixed rate long term financing minimize the effects of inflationary conditions 
year readiness the year computer issue refers to a condition in computer software where a two digit field rather than a four digit field is used to distinguish a calendar year 
unless corrected some computer programs could be unable to function on january  and thereafter until corrected  as they will be unable to distinguish the correct date 
such an uncorrected condition could significantly interfere with the conduct of the company s business  could result in disruption of its operations  and could subject it to potentially significant legal liabilities 
the company has been and is in the process of updating much of its existing software for year compliance by acquiring new and upgraded third party software packages to replace those currently used by the company and by modifying existing internally developed software 
while the company believes it has made substantial progress in resolving any year issues  sufficient testing to date has not been completed to fully validate readiness 
additional testing is planned during fiscal to reasonably ensure year readiness 
if such resolution does not occur  the company believes it will be able to conduct its business  possibly at reduced volume  using its already year compliant mainframe  server  and personal computer software until resolution occurs 
the remote possibility also exists that the company could inadvertently fail to correct a year problem with a mechanical equipment microcontroller 
the company believes the impact of such an occurrence would be minor  as substantial year compliant equipment additions and upgrades have occurred in recent years 
the company has surveyed its major customers and suppliers regarding their progress on resolving year issues 
responses indicate substantial progress by them with ongoing programs in effect 
to date year readiness has cost the company an estimated million including upgrades to existing systems and could cost a comparable amount to complete 
results compared with sales in increased to billion from billion in net income increased to million compared with million in the prior fiscal year 
increased revenues resulted from increased unit volume  especially in finished product assembly

fiscal was the first full year of operations for the fountain  colorado  plant purchased from apple computer on may  the small decline in foreign operations sales in from resulted mainly from reduced disk drive participation in asia 
during improved operating margins were experienced in europe as a result of cost containment  and in mexico  as volumes grew 
these improvements were partially offset by the effects in asia of customer discontinuance of certain disk drive programs resulting in lower production volumes

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk short term interest rate changes can impact the company s interest expense on its variable interest rate debt  as well as the discount reflected as interest expense on its accounts receivable sold under an asset securitization agreement 
variable interest rate debt of million was outstanding at june  no amounts were sold under the asset securitization agreement at june  the impact of a hypothetical basis point two percent change in short term interest rates would not be material to the company an increase in annual interest expense of approximately million could result 
this hypothetical short term interest rate change impact is based on existing business and economic conditions and does not consider alternative financing available to the company 
the company predominantly conducts its foreign sales and purchase transactions in us dollars  or under customer contract provisions that protect against most major currency risks 
the largest currency risk at june   was that associated with brazilian operations 
unlike other foreign operations of sci  the plant there may be subject to the effects of currency devaluation on certain customers contracts until forward pricing is adjusted accordingly normally monthly 
at june   the company had approximately million of net current assets subject to this currency exposure 
while the brazilian currency has been relatively stable  the company considers the devaluation outlook too uncertain to predict 
other currency exchange risks are primarily limited to current liabilities payable in other than us dollars 
such amounts generally relate to foreign plant wages  taxes and facility operating costs 
accordingly  the company does not believe the effects of changes in currency exchange rates upon such non us dollar transactions would be material 
changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates may impact the geographic area where the company s revenue is derived 
if foreign currencies are devalued  manufacturing costs of plants in those countries may become more competitive with domestic plants 
the company  when advisable  may enter into hedge contracts to reduce its currency risks on known transactions 
additionally  when deemed advantageous  the company may enter into interest rate swap agreements to adjust the interest rate on existing debt 
the company has not entered into speculative interest or currency agreements  nor does it expect to do so 
when significant currency exposures arise  the company may endeavor to balance exposed assets with offsetting exposed liabilities where practical
