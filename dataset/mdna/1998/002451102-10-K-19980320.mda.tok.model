the equitable announced in january its intention to accelerate the sale of assets from the real estate portfolio by disposing of properties with a depreciated cost of approximately billion over the next to months 
in connection with this program  equitable life reclassified billion depreciated cost of continuing and discontinued operations equity real estate from held for the production of income to held for sale 
since held for sale properties are carried at the lower of depreciated cost or estimated fair value  less disposition costs  the reclassification generated additions to valuation allowances of million for continuing operations in the fourth quarter of also  the review of the equity real estate portfolio identified properties held for the production of income which were impaired as determined under sfas no 
this resulted in writedowns of million for continuing operations 
the total pre tax impact of these actions was million net of related dac amortization of million for continuing operations 
in addition  these real estate actions contributed to a million strengthening of discontinued operations allowance for future losses in the fourth quarter of in  the discontinued operations loss allowance was strengthened by million 
for further information  see discontinued operations 
during the fourth quarter of  the equitable released approximately million of tax reserves related to continuing operations for years prior to continuing operations results for were impacted by reserve strengthenings as the result of experience and loss recognition studies completed for the di and pension par lines of business 
these studies resulted in the decision to increase di reserves by million  write off million of unamortized dac on the di products and increase pension par reserves by million 
see combined results of continuing operations by segment insurance operations disability income and group pension products 
continuing operations results compared to compared to  the higher pre tax results of continuing operations for reflected increased earnings for both investment services and insurance operations 
the billion increase in revenues for compared to was attributed primarily to a million increase in investment results and to a million increase in commissions  fees and other income principally due to increased business activity within investment services 
net investment income increased million for principally due to increases of million and million  respectively  for investment services and insurance operations 
the investment services increase was attributed to higher business activity while the insurance operations increase was due to higher overall investment yields  primarily attributable to other equity investments  as well as to a larger asset base 
investment gains decreased by million in from million to million 
the million gross gain recognized on the sale of ereim during second quarter was more than offset by the aforementioned increases in valuation allowances and writedowns related to equity real estate during the fourth quarter of there were investment losses of million on general account investment assets as compared to losses of million in investment gains at dlj increased by million with higher gains of million on other equity investments and higher dealer and trading gains of million 
the gains on other equity investments in included a gain of million on the sale of the remaining shares of a single corporate development portfolio investment 
also in  a gain of million was recognized as a result of the issuance of alliance units to third parties upon completion of the cursitor acquisition 
for  total benefits and other deductions increased by million from  reflecting increases in other operating costs and expenses of billion partially offset by a million decrease in policyholders benefits and a million decrease in interest credited to policyholders 
the increase in other operating costs and expenses was attributable to increased costs of billion in investment services partially offset by a million decrease in insurance operations 
the million increase in federal income taxes was due to the increase in earnings from continuing operations partially offset by the aforementioned release of prior years tax reserves of million 
minority interest in net income of consolidated subsidiaries reflected the effect of alliance s second quarter writedown of the carrying value of the cursitor intangible assets 
see combined results of continuing operations by segment investment services 
results compared to compared to  the lower pre tax results from continuing operations for reflected the impact on insurance operations results of the aforementioned reserve strengthenings totaling million and the writeoff of unamortized dac on the di business of million 
absent these actions  insurance operations pre tax results would have increased by million in over offsetting the lower insurance operations results were increased earnings in investment services and lower losses in corporate and other of million and million  respectively 
the decrease in federal income taxes was attributed to lower pre tax results of operations 
the increase in minority interest in net income of consolidated subsidiaries was primarily attributable to increased earnings at both dlj and alliance and a full year s impact in of dlj s october initial public offering ipo 
the billion increase in revenues for compared to was primarily attributed to investment services million higher commissions  fees and other income due to increased business activity and higher investment results of million  principally at dlj 
insurance operations and corporate and other contributed million and million  respectively  to the year s revenue growth 
net investment income increased million for as compared to the prior year principally due to increases of million and million  respectively  for investment services and insurance operations 
the investment services increase was attributable to higher business activity while the insurance operations increase was due to higher overall investment yields on a larger asset base  including the investment of proceeds received from the issuance of million of surplus notes in december investment gains increased by million for from million for investment gains at dlj increased by million with increased dealer and trading gains of million offset by lower gains of million on other equity investments 
the gains on other equity investments included a gain of million on the sale of the remaining shares of a single corporate development portfolio investment 
a gain of million was recognized as a result of the issuance of alliance units to third parties upon completion of the cursitor acquisition 
there were investment losses of million on general account investment assets as compared to losses of million in for  total benefits and other deductions increased by billion from  reflecting increases in other operating expenses of million  the di dac writeoff and di and pension par reserve strengthenings of million  a million increase in other policyholders benefits  million higher corporate interest expense and a million increase in interest credited to policyholders 
the increase in other operating expenses was principally attributable to increased operating costs of million in investment services associated with increased business activities 
the increase in other policyholders benefits primarily was attributable to higher claims experience on directly written and reinsurance assumed di policies before reserve strengthening and higher mortality experience on variable and interest sensitive and participating life policies  with the impact of the higher mortality being largely offset by dac amortization as reflected in other operating expenses 
higher corporate interest expense primarily resulted from the interest on the surplus notes issued by equitable life in the fourth quarter of the million increase in interest credited to policyholders for insurance operations primarily was due to small changes in crediting rates applied to a larger individual life and annuity in force book of business 
federal income taxes federal income taxes resulted in an expense of million for as compared to million in and million in  reflecting the equitable s earnings pattern over the three year period and the tax reserve release mentioned above 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   the equitable s deferred income tax account reflected a net asset of million as compared to a net asset of million at december  management believes the million gross deferred tax asset at december  is more likely than not to be fully realizable and  consequently  no valuation allowance is necessary 
combined results of continuing operations by segment insurance operations 
the following table presents the combined results from continuing operations for insurance operations insurance operations in millions as closed reported block combined combined combined policy fees  premiums and other income     net investment income     investment losses  net contribution from the closed block total revenues      total benefits and other deductions      earnings loss from continuing operations before federal income taxes  minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting change results compared to the earnings from continuing operations in insurance operations for reflected an increase of million from the prior year 
higher net investment income  higher policy fees on variable and interest sensitive life and individual annuities contracts  higher dac capitalization  lower life insurance mortality and improved di and group pension results were offset by higher investment losses  higher policy acquisition costs and the provision for employee termination and exit costs established in the second quarter 
the improved di and group pension results reflect the establishment of premium deficiency reserves and the writeoff of dac in the fourth quarter of to the extent periodic results from these businesses differ from the assumptions used in establishing those reserves  the resulting earnings loss will impact insurance operations results 
total revenues decreased by million primarily due to investment results which decreased by million and a million decline in premiums offset by a million increase in policy fees and a million increase in commissions  fees and other income 
insurance operations million increase in investment income principally was due to million higher overall yields on a larger general account investment asset base  offset by million lower interest received on reduced amounts due from discontinued operations 
income from other equity investments increased during by million as compared to returns on other equity investments have fluctuated significantly from period to period and there can be no assurance recent performance will be sustained 
there were higher losses on the general account investment portfolio in as compared to principally due to losses on equity real estate which totaled million  million higher than in the losses were primarily due to writedowns on real estate held for the production of income and additions to valuation allowances in the fourth quarter of as discussed above 
the decrease in premiums principally was due to lower traditional life and individual health premiums 
policy fee income rose by million to million due to higher insurance and annuity account balances 
total benefits and other deductions for decreased million from the total which included reserve strengthenings and a dac writeoff aggregating million 
excluding the reserve actions  there was a million decrease in as compared to as increases of million in other operating expenses and million higher dac amortization were partially offset by million higher dac capitalization and a decrease in policy benefits 
the increase in other operating expenses resulted from higher commissions and variable expenses related to increased sales  million higher restructuring costs  higher costs related to the annuity wholesale distribution channel introduced in the latter part of and higher costs associated with litigation 
the sales related expense increases were substantially offset by higher dac capitalization 
the net decrease of million in policyholders benefits  after excluding the effect of the reserve strengthening  primarily resulted from a lower increase in reserves on di business and improved mortality experience on the larger in force book of business for variable and interest sensitive life policies 
this lower mortality experience and higher investment spreads resulted in an increase in the amortization of dac on variable and interest sensitive life policies 
disability income and group pension products during the competitive market conditions of the s  equitable life issued a large amount of noncancelable individual di policies with policy terms and underwriting criteria that were competitive at the time but are more liberal than those available today 
these policies have fixed premiums and are not cancelable as long as premiums are paid 
the majority of the di policies issued before provide for lifetime benefits and many include cost of living riders and provide benefits which exceed  per month  while defining disability as the insured s inability to perform his or her own occupation 
equitable life also had assumed reinsurance on a block of di policies with characteristics similar to its own pre policies 
during the years through  di providers  including equitable life  experienced claims incidence rates higher than previous industry experience 
the equitable had recognized pre tax losses from operations of million and million in and  respectively  for the di line of business before the fourth quarter reserve strengthening 
in light of unfavorable results  in late a loss recognition study of the di business was completed 
the study indicated the dac was not recoverable and the reserves were not sufficient 
therefore  million of unamortized dac on di policies at december  was written off and reserves for directly written di policies and di reinsurance assumed were strengthened by million 
equitable life had issued pension par products designed to provide participating annuity guarantees and benefit payment services to corporate sponsored pension plans 
equitable life has made no new sales of these products in several years 
at december   a significant portion of these contracts either had been converted into non participating contracts or effectively were non participating because they were unlikely to produce future dividends due to improving mortality trends and poor investment performance 
the group pension business produced pre tax losses of million and million in and  respectively  before the fourth quarter reserve strengthening 
operating losses incurred in and primarily resulted from lower investment results  particularly related to investment losses on mortgages and equity real estate and deteriorating mortality experience as evidenced by mortality losses of million and million experienced in and  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of  a loss recognition study was completed which incorporated management s assumptions at that date 
the study s results prompted management to establish a pension par premium deficiency reserve  resulting in a million pre tax charge to the results of continuing operations at december   principally attributable to improved mortality assumptions 
based on the experience that emerged on these two books of business during  management continues to believe the assumptions and estimates used to develop the di and pension par reserve strengthenings are reasonable 
the determination of reserves requires making assumptions and estimates covering a number of factors  including mortality  morbidity and interest rates  claims experience and lapse rates based on then known facts and circumstances 
such factors as claim incidence and termination rates can be affected by changes in the economic  legal and regulatory environments  as well as societal factors eg work ethic 
while management believes the di and pension par reserves have been calculated on a reasonable basis and are adequate  there can be no assurance that they will be sufficient to provide for all future liabilities 
beginning february  equisource  inc  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of equitable life  entered into an agreement that permits equitable life s career agency force to offer di policies of provident life and accident insurance company provident 
equitable life no longer underwrites new di policies 
as a result of a acquisition  paul revere life insurance company  which administers equitable life s di business  and provident are now affiliates 
results compared to the loss from continuing operations of million in primarily was due to the million of reserve strengthenings  including the writeoff of unamortized dac on di products  in the fourth quarter of if the effect of these charges was eliminated  earnings from continuing operations for insurance operations would have totaled million  an increase of million over the prior year  reflecting an increase in earnings in the core life and annuity lines of business  partially offset by increased losses in the reinsurance  di and group pension lines of business 
total revenues increased by million primarily due to a million increase in investment results  an million increase in policy fees on variable and interest sensitive life and individual annuity contracts and a million increase in commissions  fees and other income  offset by a decrease of million in premiums 
the decrease in premiums principally was due to lower traditional life premiums and lower reinsurance assumed on individual annuity contracts 
higher investment income attributed to higher overall investment yields on a larger asset base  which included the net proceeds from the issuance of the surplus notes in december  was partially offset by higher investment losses in principally due to lower gains on fixed maturities 
excluding the million effect of reserve strengthenings and dac writeoff in  total benefits and other deductions for increased by million from policyholders benefits before the reserve strengthenings increased million due to higher claims experience on directly written and reinsurance assumed di policies and higher mortality in the participating and variable and interest sensitive life products  partially offset by favorable mortality experience on term life insurance 
the impact of the higher mortality in the participating and variable and interest sensitive life products was substantially offset by reduced dac amortization of million attributed to life insurance products 
other operating expenses increased million principally due to higher employee benefit costs related to lower interest rate assumptions  higher costs associated with building new distribution channels and new product initiatives  costs related to the consolidation of insurance operations centers  higher volume related commissions and increasing costs associated with litigation  partially offset by lower amortization of dac principally attributable to the mortality noted above and million principally attributable to estimates of enhanced future annuity gross margins

includes reinsurance assumed and health insurance 
first year premiums and deposits for individual insurance and annuity products in increased from prior year levels by billion due to higher sales of individual annuities and variable and interest sensitive life products 
renewal premiums and deposits for individual insurance and annuity products increased by million during over the prior year as increases in the larger block of variable and interest sensitive life and individual annuity policies were partially offset by decreases in traditional life policies and other product lines 
the increase in first year individual annuities premiums and deposits in over the prior year included million from a line of retirement annuity products sold through complementary distribution channels 
first year individual life premiums and deposits for included million of premiums and deposits from the sale of two large company owned life insurance coli cases 
first year premiums and deposits for individual insurance and annuity products in increased from levels by million primarily due to higher sales of individual annuities offset in part by lower reinsurance assumed on individual annuity contracts 
renewal premiums and deposits for individual insurance and annuity products increased by million during over as increases in the larger block of variable and interest sensitive life and individual annuity policies were partially offset by decreases in traditional life policies and other product lines 
the increase in first year individual annuities premiums and deposits in over included million from a line of retirement annuity products introduced in partially offset by an approximately million decrease in premiums related to an exchange program that offered contractholders of existing spda contracts with no remaining surrender charges an opportunity to exchange their contracts for new flexible premium variable contracts thereby retaining assets in the equitable and establishing new surrender charge scales 
the administration s budget proposals announced in february contain provisions which  if enacted  could have an adverse impact on certain sales in the non qualified marketplace and  depending on grandfathering provisions  surrenders of certain variable insurance products and business owned life insurance policies and could reduce the tax deduction allowed to the insurance group for reserves for annuity contracts 
management cannot predict what other proposals may be made  what legislation  if any  might be introduced or enacted or what the effect of any such legislation might be 
surrenders and withdrawals  policy loans the following table summarizes insurance operations surrenders and withdrawals  including universal life and investment type contract withdrawals  for major individual insurance and annuities product lines 
surrenders and withdrawals in millions individual insurance and annuities product lines individual annuities    variable and interest sensitive life traditional life total    surrendered traditional and variable and interest sensitive life insurance policies represented  and of average surrenderable future policy benefits and policyholders account balances for such life insurance contracts in force during  and  respectively 
surrendered individual annuity contracts represented  and of average surrenderable policyholders account balances for individual annuity contracts in force during those same years  respectively 
policy and contract surrenders and withdrawals increased million during compared to the million increase in individual annuities surrenders was principally due to increased surrenders of equi vest contracts as favorable market performance increased account values  consequently increasing surrender amounts with no significant increase in actual surrender rates 
policy and contract surrenders and withdrawals increased million during compared to due to the million and million increases in the variable and interest sensitive life and individual annuities surrenders and withdrawals  respectively 
the persistency of life insurance and annuity products is a critical element of their profitability 
as of december   all in force individual life insurance policies other than individual life term policies without cash values which comprise of in force policies and more than of individual annuity contracts as measured by reserves were surrenderable 
however  a surrender charge often applies in the early contract years and declines to zero over time 
contracts without surrender provisions cannot be terminated prior to maturity 
margins on individual insurance and annuity products insurance operations results significantly depend on profit margins between investment results from general account investment assets and interest credited on individual insurance and annuity products 
during  margins increased due to higher investment yields 
during  the crediting rate ranges were to for variable and interest sensitive life insurance  to for variable deferred annuities  and to for spda contracts  the crediting rate of was used for retirement investment accounts throughout margins on individual insurance and annuity products are affected by interest rate fluctuations 
rising interest rates result in a decline in the market value of assets 
however  the positive cash flows from renewal premiums  investment income and maturities of existing assets would make an early disposition of investment assets to meet operating cash flow requirements unlikely 
rising interest rates also would result in available cash flows from maturities being invested at higher interest rates  which would help support a gradual increase in new business and renewal interest rates on interest sensitive products 
a sharp  sudden rise in the interest rate environment without a concurrent increase in crediting rates could result in higher surrenders  particularly for annuities 
the effect of such surrenders would be to reduce earnings modestly over the long term while increasing earnings in the period of the surrenders to the extent surrender charges were applicable 
to protect against sharp increases in interest rates  equitable life maintains an interest rate cap program designed to hedge crediting rate increases on interest sensitive individual annuity contracts 
at december   the outstanding notional amounts of contracts purchased and sold totaled billion and million  respectively  as compared to billion and billion  respectively  at december  if interest rates fall  crediting interest rates and dividends would be adjusted subject to competitive pressures 
only a minority of this segment s policies and contracts have fixed interest rates locked in at issue 
the majority of contracts are adjustable  having guaranteed minimum rates ranging from approximately to 
more than of the life policies have a minimum rate of or lower 
should interest rates fall below such policy minimums  adjustments to life policies mortality and expense charges could cover the shortfall in most situations 
lower crediting interest rates and dividends could result in higher surrenders

the holding company group portfolio is discussed in a separate section following the discussion of the general account investment portfolio 
general account investment portfolio at december   insurance operations  including the closed block  had billion of general account investment assets to support the insurance and annuity liabilities of its continuing operations 
in view of the similar asset quality characteristics of the major asset categories  management believes it is appropriate to discuss the closed block assets and the assets outside of the closed block on a combined basis as general account investment assets 
the investment results of general account investment assets and the holding company group investment assets are reflected in the equitable s results from continuing operations  investment results of discontinued operations investment assets are reflected in discontinued operations

management defines problem securities in the fixed maturity category as securities i as to which principal and or interest payments are in default or are to be restructured pursuant to commenced negotiations or ii issued by a company that went into bankruptcy subsequent to the acquisition of such securities 
the amortized cost of problem fixed maturities decreased to million of the amortized cost of this category at december  from million at december   principally as assets were written down or sold

mortgages consist of commercial  agricultural and residential loans 
as of december   commercial mortgages totaled billion of the amortized cost of the category  agricultural loans were billion and residential loans were million

the amortized cost of wholly or partially non accruing problem commercial mortgages was million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
the equitable categorizes mortgages as impaired under sfas no 
s definition when it believes contractual income and or contractual principal is not collectible 
impairment is usually measured based on either a net present value or collateral value methodology 
for loans measured for impairment using the collateral value method  interest income is recognized on a cash basis 
if the net present value method is used  income is accrued on the net carrying value of the mortgage 
based on its monthly monitoring of commercial mortgages  management identifies a class of potential problem mortgages  which consists of mortgage loans that are not currently classified as problems but for which management has serious doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with the present loan payment terms and which may result in the loan becoming a problem or being restructured 
the decision whether to classify a performing mortgage loan as a potential problem involves significant subjective judgment by management as to likely future market conditions and developments with respect to the borrower or the individual mortgaged property

an additional million of commercial mortgage principal payments  including million of payments at maturity on commercial mortgage balloon loans  are scheduled for and depending on market conditions and lending practices in future years  some maturing loans may have to be refinanced  restructured or foreclosed upon 
during  and  the amortized cost of foreclosed commercial mortgages totaled million  million and million  respectively 
equity real estate 
the equity real estate category consists primarily of office  retail  industrial  mixed use and other properties 
office properties constituted the largest component of amortized cost of this portfolio at december  during  and  the equitable received proceeds from the sale of equity real estate of million  million and million  respectively  and recognized gains losses of million  million and million  respectively 
the gains losses reflected total writedowns and additions to valuation allowances on properties sold of million  million and million  respectively  at date of sale 
management establishes valuation allowances on individual properties identified as held for sale with the objective of fully reserving for anticipated shortfalls between depreciated cost and sales proceeds 
the depreciated cost of equity real estate properties held for sale at december  was billion for which allowances of million have been established 
on a quarterly basis  the valuation allowances on real estate held for sale are adjusted to reflect changes in market values in relation to depreciated cost 
since the size of the portfolio of properties held for sale is significantly larger than in prior periods due to the fourth quarter action discussed previously  fluctuations in the related valuation allowances prior to actual sale could be larger than those experienced in prior periods 
at december   the overall vacancy rate for the equitable s real estate office properties was  with a vacancy rate of for properties acquired as investment real estate and for properties acquired through foreclosure 
the national commercial office vacancy rate was as of september  as measured by cb commercial 
lease rollover rates for office properties for  and range from to 
at december   the equity real estate category included billion depreciated cost of properties acquired as investment real estate or of depreciated cost of equity real estate held and billion amortized cost of properties acquired through foreclosure including in substance foreclosure 
cumulative writedowns recognized on foreclosed properties were million through december  as of december   the carrying value of the equity real estate portfolio was of its original cost 
the depreciated cost of foreclosed equity real estate totaled billion of depreciated cost and billion at year end and  respectively 
other equity investments 
other equity investments consist of limited partnership interests managed by third parties that invest in a selection of equity and below investment grade fixed maturities million or of amortized cost of this portfolio at december  and other equity securities million or 
the limited partnership funds in which the insurance group invests can create significant volatility in investment income since they are accounted for in accordance with the equity method that treats increases and decreases in the allocable portion of the estimated fair value of the underlying partnership assets  whether realized or unrealized  as investment income or loss to the equitable 
though not included in the general account s other equity investments discussed above  the excess of separate accounts assets over separate accounts liabilities at december  of million represented an investment by the general account principally in equity securities 
returns on all equity investments are very volatile and there can be no assurance recent performance will be sustained

for  the holding company group investment results decreased by million from the level 
this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in investment income of million for compared to on the holding company s smaller fixed maturities portfolio 
for  the holding company group investment results increased by million from the level 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in investment income on trust assets of million  an increase in realized gains on fixed maturities of million and an increase in realized gains on equity securities of million 
discontinued operations in  management adopted a plan to discontinue the business of certain pension operations consisting of wind up annuities and gic lines of business and recorded loss provisions based on management s best judgment at that time 
during and  the loss provisions were strengthened by million and million  respectively 
the principal factor in the reserve strengthening action was the change in projected cash flows for equity real estate due to management s plan to accelerate the sale of equity real estate 
the primary factors contributing to the strengthening were changes in projected cash flows for mortgages and other equity investments due to lower portfolio balances as the result of higher than anticipated redemptions and repayments in and an increase in assumed mortgage defaults as well as an increase in projected benefit payments due to the expected increase in longevity of wind up annuities beneficiaries 
at year end  billion of policyholders liabilities were outstanding  of which million were related to gic products and the remainder to wind up annuities 
payments of maturing gic contracts and voluntary client withdrawals totaled million and million in and  respectively  with scheduled payments of maturing gic contracts of million anticipated in substantially all of the remaining discontinued operations liabilities at december  will relate to wind up annuities 
the equitable s quarterly process for evaluating the loss provisions applies the current period s results of the discontinued operations against the allowance  re estimates future losses  and adjusts the provisions  if appropriate 
additionally  as part of the equitable s annual planning process which takes place in the fourth quarter of each year  investment and benefit cash flow projections are prepared 
these projections were utilized in the fourth quarter evaluation of the adequacy of the loss provisions 
there can be no assurance the losses provided for will not differ from the losses ultimately realized 
to the extent actual results or future projections of the discontinued operations differ from management s current best estimates underlying the loss provisions  the difference would be reflected as earnings or loss from discontinued operations within the consolidated statements of earnings 
results of operations 
excluding the current year s reserve strengthenings  million of pre tax losses were incurred in compared to million in and million in  these pre tax losses incurred were charged to the discontinued operations loss provisions 
the premium deficiency reserve and loss allowance for wind up annuities and gic contracts totaled million at december   including the million total of pre tax reserve strengthenings during discontinued operations investment income of million was million lower than principally due to a decreased investment asset base 
investment income in of million was million lower than primarily due to the absence of a tax settlement which benefited discontinued operations in and lower investment assets due to net repayments of billion of borrowings from continuing operations by discontinued operations in  partially offset by higher yield from other equity investments 
net investment losses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
interest credited on wind up annuities and gic contracts was million in  down million and million  from and  respectively  primarily due to repayments of amounts due under gic contracts 
the weighted average crediting rates were  and in  and  respectively 
the interest expense on intersegment borrowings by the discontinued operations from continuing operations was million in  down million and million  respectively  from and levels  due to net repayments 
amounts due to continuing operations of million and billion at december  and  respectively  consisted of intersegment borrowings by discontinued operations from continuing operations  offset by obligations of continuing operations to provide assets to fund discontinued operations accumulated deficit which totaled million and million in and  respectively 
estimates of annual net cash flows for discontinued operations follow projections at december  in billions the increase in projected cash flows for the projection resulted from a higher level of assumed real estate sales and the expected settlement of million by continuing operations of its obligation to fund the accumulated deficit of the discontinued operations 
the intersegment loan balance at december  of million is expected to be completely repaid during the weighted average interest rate on intersegment loans in was as compared to in the projections at december  assumed no new intersegment loans are made 
other material assumptions used in the determination of cash flow projections at december  and follow i future annual investment income projections on the discontinued operations investment portfolio through maturity or assumed disposition of substantially all of the existing investment assets ranged in the projection from to as compared to to in the projections 
the increase in the expected yields is primarily attributable to improved yields on equity real estate following the fourth quarter writedowns on property held for the production of income 
other equity investments earnings in excess of those assumed were treated as timing differences in the projection and are expected to reverse in future cash flows 
ii in the projection  significant sales of equity real estate over the next to months were assumed  with the proceeds therefrom and from other maturing discontinued operations investment assets being used to repay outstanding borrowings or to pay maturing discontinued operations liabilities 
in the projections  sales of equity real estate over time as market conditions improved were assumed 
in both projections  the assumptions underlying the equity real estate cash flow projections were consistent with the cash flow projections used in the determination of impairment pursuant to sfas no 
iii mortality experience for wind up annuities was based on the gam group annuity mortality table with projections for future mortality improvements 
in the projection  the methodology for projecting the wind up annuities cash flows was refined to incorporate asset and liability cash flow projections beyond the year in the projection  only the liability cash flows were explicitly projected beyond the year  with the assets implicitly assumed to earn beyond that date 
discontinued operations investment portfolio in  investment results from discontinued operations investment assets totaled million  a million decline from due to the million higher investment losses principally resulting from the fourth quarter increases in valuation allowances of million and writedowns relating to equity real estate of million and the million lower investment income

year year compliance efforts have been undertaken by equitable life  dlj and alliance 
costs to modify existing applications related to these efforts are expensed as incurred 
equitable life began addressing the year issue in and believes it has identified those of its systems critical to business operations that are not year compliant 
by year end  management expects the work of modifying or replacing non compliant systems will substantially be completed and expects a comprehensive test of its year compliance will be performed in the first half of the cost of equitable life s year compliance project is currently estimated at million through the end of  approximately million of which is expected to be incurred in in connection with dlj s recent expansion  entry into new products and its move to new corporate headquarters  many of its newer installed communications and data processing systems are year compliant 
dlj has undertaken a project to identify and modify non year compliant data processing systems in anticipation of the year dlj expects that most of its significant year corrections should be tested and in production by the end of the cost of dlj s year compliance project is estimated to be between and million through the end of  approximately million of which had been incurred through december  alliance began addressing the year compliance issue on an informal basis several years ago in connection with the replacement or upgrading of certain computer systems and applications 
during  alliance began a formal year initiative  which established a structured and coordinated process to deal with the year issue 
alliance is currently assessing the impact of year issues on its domestic and international computer systems and applications 
currently  management of alliance expects the required corrections and modifications for the majority of its significant systems and applications will be completed and tested by the end of full integration testing of these systems and testing of interfaces with third party vendors will continue through the total cost of the initiative is currently estimated to be between million and million 
this estimate includes between million and million for expenditures related to the replacement of computer systems and applications which will be capitalized and amortized over future periods 
equitable life  dlj and alliance continue to seek assurances from third parties on whose systems and services the equitable relies to a significant extent that such third parties systems are or will be year compliant 
there can be no assurance that the systems of such third parties will be year compliant or that any third party s failure to have year compliant systems would not have a material adverse effect on the equitable s systems and operations 
any significant unresolved difficulty related to the year compliance initiatives could have a material adverse effect on the equitable 
however  assuming the timely completion of the equitable s current plans  and provided third parties systems are year compliant  the year issue should not have a material adverse impact on the equitable s business or operations 
liquidity and capital resources the equitable companies incorporated in  the holding company redeemed its subordinated debentures and all of the outstanding shares of two series of its preferred stock while dlj significantly increased its long term borrowings 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity requirements the holding company s cash requirements include debt service on its senior debt  operating expenses  taxes and dividends on its common stock 
pre tax debt service on its senior and subordinated debt was approximately million in the holding company s general and administrative expenses for totaled million 
since becoming a public company in  the holding company s board of directors has declared quarterly cash dividends of 
per share on the outstanding shares of its common stock 
during  aggregate cash dividends paid on the holding company s common stock were million 
on february   the holding company and four special purpose trusts filed a shelf registration statement with the sec  under which the registrants may issue up to billion of senior debt and subordinated debt of the holding company  and preferred securities of the trusts guaranteed by the holding company 
liquidity sources at december   the holding company held cash and short term investments and us treasury securities of approximately million 
other primary sources of liquidity for the holding company include i amounts the holding company may receive from its subsidiaries in connection with sect distributions  ii dividends from dlj and iii dividends  distributions or sales proceeds from less liquid investment assets 
the holding company held less liquid investment assets having an aggregate carrying value of approximately million at december  other potential sources of liquidity for the equitable include sales of dlj common stock held by the holding company  the issuance of additional securities by the holding company and dividends from equitable life 
the assets of the sect the  remaining shares of the holding company s series d convertible preferred stock will be distributed over time subject to periodic minimum and maximum requirements to fund various employee compensation and benefit programs of certain of the equitable s subsidiaries 
these subsidiaries will pay the holding company an amount equal to any such distributions 
management expects amounts received by the holding company from its subsidiaries in connection with distributions by the sect will be a significant source of funds 
the aggregate amount available to the holding company from this source will fluctuate over time with changes in the market value of the equitable s common stock 
dividends on dlj s outstanding common stock paid to the holding company in and were million in both years 
certain of dlj s existing credit agreements include dividend covenants but management does not expect these covenants to materially affect the payment of dividends by dlj 
in and prior years  dlj was included in the equitable s consolidated tax group for federal income tax purposes and dlj made payments of million and million in and  respectively  under this tax sharing agreement 
effective january   as a result of the holding company s sale of  shares of dlj common stock to axa in december  dlj ceased to be eligible for inclusion in the consolidated tax group 
no amounts would be payable by dlj to the holding company under the tax sharing agreement for periods after december   however  amounts may continue to be paid with respect to periods prior to tax deconsolidation 
the tax sharing agreement with dlj had been a source of liquidity for the holding company  although amounts paid to the holding company thereunder may have to be paid to the irs or  under certain circumstances  returned to dlj 
since the demutualization  the holding company has not received any dividends from equitable life 
under the new york insurance law  equitable life would be permitted to pay shareholder dividends to the holding company only if it files notice of its intention to declare such a dividend and the amount thereof with the superintendent and the superintendent  who by statute has broad discretion in such matters  does not disapprove the distribution 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
management believes the primary sources of liquidity described above are sufficient to meet the holding company s cash requirements for several years 
insurance group the insurance group s principal cash flow sources are premiums  deposits and charges on policies and contracts  investment income  repayments of principal and proceeds from maturities and sales of general account investment assets and dividends and distributions from subsidiaries 
the liquidity requirements of the insurance group principally relate to the liabilities associated with its various life insurance  annuity and group pension products in its continuing operations  the liabilities of the discontinued operations and operating expenses  including debt service 
for information on long term debt  including the surplus notes  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
insurance group liabilities include the payment of benefits under life insurance  annuity and group pension products  as well as cash payments in connection with policy surrenders  withdrawals and loans 
during  management may from time to time explore selective acquisition opportunities in equitable life s core insurance and asset management businesses 
the liquidity requirements of the insurance group are monitored regularly to match cash inflows with cash requirements 
the insurance group forecasts its daily cash needs and periodically reviews its projected sources and uses of funds  as well as the asset  liability  investment and cash flow assumptions underlying these projections 
adjustments are periodically made to the insurance group s investment policies with respect to  among other things  the maturity and risk characteristics of general account investment assets to reflect changes in the insurance group s cash needs and also to reflect changing business and economic conditions 
sources of insurance group liquidity the primary source of short term liquidity to support continuing and discontinued operations is a pool of highly liquid  high quality  short term instruments structured to provide liquidity in excess of the insurance group s expected cash requirements 
at december   this asset pool provided the insurance group an aggregate of million in highly liquid short term investments  as compared to million and billion at december  and  respectively 
in addition  the insurance group has available for its liquidity needs a substantial portfolio of public bonds including us treasury and agency securities and other investment grade fixed maturities 
other sources of liquidity include dividends and distributions from equitable life s investment subsidiaries  particularly alliance 
in  equitable life received cash distributions from alliance of million as compared to million in and million in as a result of the taxpayer relief act of signed into law on august   current law provides that certain publicly traded partnerships such as alliance have the option to pay a tax on gross income while maintaining partnership tax status 
alliance elected to utilize this option 
as a result  distributions by alliance are expected to be lower by an estimated reflecting the effect of this new tax on alliance s earnings 
management believes it has sufficient liquidity in the form of short term assets and its bond portfolio together with cash flows from operations and scheduled maturities of fixed maturities  to satisfy its liquidity needs 
equitable life also has a commercial paper program with an issue limit of up to million 
this program is available for general corporate purposes to support equitable life s liquidity needs and is supported by equitable life s existing million bank credit facility  which expires in june at december   million was outstanding under the commercial paper program  there were no amounts outstanding under the back up credit facility 
for more information on guarantees  commitments and contingencies  see notes    and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
factors affecting insurance group liquidity the insurance group s liquidity needs are affected by fluctuations in the level of surrenders and withdrawals previously discussed in combined results of continuing operations by segment insurance operations surrenders and withdrawals  policy loans 
management believes the insurance group has adequate internal sources of funds for its presently anticipated needs 
risk based capital since  life insurers  including equitable life  have been subject to certain risk based capital rbc guidelines 
the rbc guidelines provide a method to measure the adjusted capital statutory capital and surplus plus the asset valuation reserve avr and other adjustments that a life insurance company should have for regulatory purposes  taking into account the risk characteristics of the company s investments and products 
a life insurance company s rbc ratio will vary over time depending upon many factors  including its earnings  the mix of assets in its investment portfolio  the nature of the products it sells and its rate of sales growth  as well as changes in the rbc formulas required by regulators 
while the rbc guidelines are intended to be a regulatory tool only  and are not intended as a means to rank insurers generally  comparisons of rbc ratios of life insurers have become generally available 
equitable life was above its target rbc ratio at years end and principally because of the rbc formula s treatment of equitable life s large holdings of subsidiary common stock including its interest in alliance and its interest in dlj  equity real estate and mortgages  equitable life s year end rbc ratio is expected to continue to be lower than those of its competitors in the life insurance industry 
the naic has undertaken a comprehensive codification of statutory accounting practices for life insurers 
the resulting changes  once the codification project has been completed and the new principles adopted and implemented  are not expected to have a material adverse impact on the insurance group s statutory results and financial position but may cause a modest reduction in statutory surplus 
a detailed review of the final statutory accounting practices will be necessary to determine their actual impact 
still subject to naic and aicpa approval  the codification will not become effective prior to january  at december   million or of the insurance group s aggregate statutory capital and surplus representing of statutory capital and surplus and avr resulted from surplus relief reinsurance 
the level of surplus relief reinsurance was reduced by approximately million in investment subsidiaries alliance s principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations  proceeds from sales of newly issued alliance units and borrowings from lending institutions 
in february  approximately million alliance units and million of notes were issued as partial consideration in the cursitor acquisition 
in february  alliance terminated its million revolving credit facility and its million commercial paper program  replacing them with a new million  five year revolving credit facility with a group of banks 
this revolving credit facility provides backup liquidity for commercial paper issued under alliance s million commercial paper program 
the interest rate is a floating rate generally based on a defined prime rate  a rate related to libor or the federal funds rate  at alliance s option 
at december   alliance had million of commercial paper outstanding  there were no amounts outstanding under its revolving credit facility 
as a result of the continued growth in alliance s business and the use of the deferred sales charge options on various alliance mutual funds  alliance may require additional sources of capital from time to time 
dlj reported total assets as of december  of approximately billion 
most of these assets are highly liquid marketable securities and short term receivables arising from securities transactions 
these assets include collateralized resale agreements and securities borrowed  both of which are secured by us government and agency securities and marketable corporate debt and equity securities 
a relatively small percentage of total assets is fixed or held for a period longer than one year 
a significant portion of dlj s borrowings is matched to the interest rate and expected holding period of the corresponding assets 
dlj monitors overall liquidity by tracking the extent to which unencumbered marketable assets exceed short term unsecured borrowing 
dlj s overall capital needs are continually reviewed to ensure that its capital base can appropriately support the anticipated needs of its businesses as well as the regulatory capital requirements of subsidiaries 
dlj has been active in raising additional long term financing  including extending the maturity of its million revolving credit facility

also  in january  dlj commenced a billion commercial paper program 
dlj historically has satisfied its needs for funds primarily from capital including long term debt  internally generated funds  uncommitted lines of credit  free credit balances in customers accounts  master notes and collateralized borrowings primarily consisting of bank loans  repurchase agreements and securities loaned 
short term funding generally is obtained at rates related to federal funds  libor and money market rates 
other borrowing costs are negotiated depending upon prevailing market conditions 
during the second quarter of  dlj replaced several individual credit facilities aggregating billion with a billion revolving credit facility  of which billion may be unsecured 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this agreement at december  consolidated cash flows net cash used by operating activities was billion for as compared to billion in cash used by operations in was attributable to the billion net change in trading activities and broker dealer receivables as compared to billion in reflecting dlj s increased level of business activity

net cash withdrawals from general account policyholders account balances were million in in addition  in  net additions to long term debt were million  down from million in the operating  investing and financing activities described above resulted in a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million in as compared to a decrease of million in and an increase of million in market risk  risk management and derivative financial instruments the equitable s businesses are subject to market risks arising from its insurance asset liability management  asset management and trading activities 
such risks are evaluated and managed on a decentralized basis 
primary market risk exposures result from interest rate fluctuations  equity price movements  changes in credit quality and  additionally at dlj  foreign currency exchange exposure 
at december   alliance had no material market risk sensitive financial instruments 
other than trading activities insurance asset liability management insurance operations results significantly depend on profit margins between investment results from general account investment assets and interest credited on individual insurance and annuity products 
management believes its fixed rate liabilities should be supported by a portfolio principally composed of fixed rate investments that can generate predictable  steady rates of return 
although these assets are purchased for long term investment  the portfolio management strategy considers them available for sale in response to changes in market interest rates  changes in prepayment risk  changes in relative values of asset sectors and individual securities and loans  changes in credit quality outlook and other relevant factors 
the objective of portfolio management is to maximize returns  taking into account interest rate and credit risks 
the insurance group s asset liability management discipline includes strategies to minimize exposure to loss as interest rates and economic and market conditions change 
as a result  the fixed maturity portfolio has modest exposure to call and prepayment risk and the vast majority of mortgage holdings are fixed rate mortgages that carry yield maintenance and prepayment provisions 
the insurance group s assets with interest rate risk include fixed maturities and mortgage loans which make up of the carrying value of general account investment assets 
as part of its asset liability management discipline  quantitative analyses are conducted that model the assets with interest rate risk assuming various changes in interest rates 
the table below shows the insurance group s potential exposure  measured in terms of fair value  to an immediate basis point increase in interest rates from levels prevailing at december  a basis point fluctuation in interest rates is a hypothetical rate scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does not represent management s view of future market changes 
while these fair value measurements provide a representation of interest rate sensitivity of fixed maturities and mortgage loans  they are based on the insurance group s portfolio exposures at a particular point in time and may not be representative of future market results 
these exposures will change as a result of ongoing portfolio activities in response to management s assessment of changing market conditions and available investment opportunities 
assets with interest rate risk fair value in millions at basis december  point change continuing operations fixed maturities fixed rate   floating rate   mortgage loans   discontinued operations fixed maturities fixed rate floating rate mortgage loans the insurance group s investment portfolio also has direct holdings of public and private equity securities 
in addition  the insurance group is exposed to equity price risk from the excess of separate accounts assets over separate accounts liabilities 
the following table shows the insurance group s potential exposure from those equity security investments  measured in terms of fair value  to an immediate drop in equity prices from those prevailing at december  a decrease in equity prices is a hypothetical scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does not represent management s view of future market changes 
the fair value measurements shown are based on the equity securities portfolio exposures at a particular point in time and these exposures will change as a result of ongoing portfolio activities in response to management s assessment of changing market conditions and available investment opportunities 
assets with equity price risk fair value in millions at equity december  price change insurance group continuing operations discontinued operations excess of separate accounts assets over separate accounts liabilities holding company group at year end  the aggregate carrying value of the insurance group s policyholders liabilities was  million  including  million of investment contracts 
the aggregate fair value of those investment contracts at year end was  million 
the insurance group s potential exposure to a relative decrease in interest rates is an increase in the fair value of those investment contracts to  million 
those investment contracts represent only a portion of the insurance group s total policyholders liabilities 
as such  meaningful assessment of net market risk exposure cannot be made by comparing the results of the invested assets sensitivity analyses presented herein to the potential exposure from the policyholders liabilities quantified in this paragraph 
asset liability management is integrated into many aspects of the insurance group s operations  including investment decisions  product development and determination of crediting rates 
as part of its risk management process  numerous economic scenarios are modeled  including cash flow testing required for insurance regulatory purposes  to determine if existing assets would be sufficient to meet projected liability cash flows 
key variables include policyholder behavior  such as persistency  under differing crediting rate strategies 
on the basis of these more comprehensive analyses  management believes there is no material solvency risk to equitable life with respect to interest rate movements up or down of basis points from year end levels or with respect to a drop in equity prices from year end levels 
as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the insurance group utilizes various derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  including interest rate swaps to convert floating rate assets to fixed rate assets  interest rate caps to hedge crediting rates on interest sensitive products  and interest rate futures to hedge a decline in interest rates between receipt of funds and purchase of appropriate assets 
to minimize credit risk exposure associated with its derivative transactions  each counterparty s credit is appraised and approved and risk control limits and monitoring procedures are applied 
credit limits are established and monitored on the basis of potential exposures which take into consideration current market values and estimates of potential future movements in market values given potential fluctuations in market interest rates 
while notional amount is the most commonly used measure of volume in the derivatives market  it is not used by the insurance group as a measure of risk as the notional amount greatly exceeds the possible credit and market loss that could arise from such transactions 
mark to market exposure is a point in time measure of the value of a derivative contract in the open market 
a positive value indicates existence of credit risk for the insurance group as the counterparty would owe money to the insurance group if the contract were closed 
alternatively  a negative value indicates the insurance group would owe money to the counterparty if the contract were closed 
if there is more than one derivatives transaction outstanding with a counterparty  a master netting arrangement exists with the counterparty 
in that case  the market risk represents the net of the positive and negative exposures with the single counterparty 
in management s view  the net potential exposure is the better measure of credit risk 
at year end  the net market value exposure of the insurance group s derivatives was million 
the table below shows the interest rate sensitivity of those derivatives  measured in terms of fair value 
these exposures will change as a result of ongoing portfolio and risk management activities

dlj monitors its market and counterparty risk on a daily basis through a number of control procedures designed to identify and evaluate the various risks to which dlj is exposed 
dlj established a risk committee comprised of senior professionals from each of the three operating and key administrative groups 
the risk committee s objective is to update risk policies as appropriate and improve monitoring capabilities throughout dlj 
an independent risk officer function is designed to oversee this process as well as to monitor adherence by the various business groups to dlj s risk policy statements issued by the risk committee 
dlj has established various committees to assist senior management in managing risk associated with investment banking and merchant banking transactions 
the objectives of the committees are to review potential clients and engagements  utilize experience with similar clients and situations  perform credit analyses for certain commitments and to analyze dlj s potential role as a principal investor 
dlj seeks to control the risks associated with its banking activities by a thorough review by various committees of the details of all transactions prior to accepting an engagement 
some of the committees which have been formed are the fairness and valuation opinion committee  the private placement committee  the restructuring coordinating committee  the equity commitment committee  the high yield underwriting committee  the bridge commitment committee  the banking review committee  the finance committee and the executive committee 
from time to time  dlj makes investments in certain merchant banking transactions or other long term corporate development investments 
dlj s merchant banking group has established several investment entities  each of which has formed its own investment committee 
these committees make all investment and disposition decisions with respect to potential and existing portfolio companies 
in addition  senior officers of dlj meet on a quarterly basis to review merchant banking and corporate development investments 
after a discussion of the financial and operational aspects of the companies involved  recommendations regarding carrying values are made for each investment to the finance committee 
the finance committee then makes a determination of fair value following a review of such recommendations 
dlj often acts as principal in customer related transactions in financial instruments which expose dlj to market risks 
dlj also engages in proprietary trading and arbitrage activities and makes dealer markets in equity securities  investment grade corporate debt  high yield securities  us government and agency securities  mortgages and mortgage backed securities and selected derivatives 
in addition  dlj s emerging markets group trades a variety of securities  including brady bonds  foreign fixed income securities and options  and issues structured notes 
as such  dlj may be required to maintain certain amounts of inventories in order to facilitate customer order flow 
dlj covers its exposure to market risk by limiting its net long or short position by selling or buying similar instruments and by utilizing various derivative financial instruments in the exchange traded and otc markets 
dlj manages risk exposure utilizing mechanisms involving various levels of management 
position limits in trading and inventory accounts are established and monitored on an ongoing basis 
current and proposed underwriting  corporate development  merchant banking and other commitments are subject to due diligence reviews by senior management as well as professionals in the appropriate business and support units involved 
trading activities generally result in the creation of inventory positions 
position and exposure reports are prepared daily by operations staff in each of the business groups engaged in trading activities for traders  trading managers  department managers  divisional management and group management personnel 
such reports are reviewed independently on a daily basis by dlj s corporate accounting group 
in addition  the corporate accounting group prepares a consolidated summarized position report indicating both long and short exposure  along with approved limits  which is distributed to various levels of management throughout dlj  including the chief executive officer  and which enables senior management to control inventory levels and monitor results of the trading groups 
dlj also reviews and monitors  at various levels of management  inventory aging  pricing  concentration and securities ratings 
in addition to position and exposure reports  dlj produces a daily revenue report which summarizes the trading  interest  commissions  fees  underwriting and other revenue items for each of the business groups 
daily revenue is reviewed for various risk factors and is independently verified by the corporate accounting group 
the daily revenue report is distributed to various levels of management throughout dlj  including the chief executive officer  and together with the position and exposure reports enables senior management to monitor and control overall activity of the trading groups 
market risk market risk represents the potential loss dlj may incur as a result of absolute and relative price movements in financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices  and other factors 
dlj s exposure to market risk is directly related to its role as financial intermediary in customer related transactions and to its proprietary trading and arbitrage activities 
dlj s primary market risk exposures as of december  include interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk and equity price risk 
interest rate risk results from maintaining inventory positions and trading in interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
dlj is exposed to interest rate risk which arises from various sources including changes in the absolute and relative level of interest rates  interest rate volatility  mortgage prepayment rates and the shape of the yield curves in various markets 
dlj s investment grade high yield corporate bonds  mortgages  equities  derivatives and convertible debt activities also expose it to the risk of loss related to changes in credit spreads 
credit spread risk arises from the potential that changes in an issuer s credit rating affect the value of financial instruments 
dlj attempts to cover its exposure to interest rate risk by entering into transactions in us government securities  options and futures and forward contracts designed to reduce dlj s risk profile 
foreign currency exchange rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign currency exchange rates or their volatilities will impact the value of financial instruments 
the principal currencies creating foreign currency exchange risk for dlj at december  were the british sterling  turkish lira and german deutsche mark 
dlj attempts to cover the risk arising from its foreign exchange activities primarily through the use of options  futures and forward transactions and currency swaps 
equity price risk results from maintaining inventory positions and making markets in equity securities 
equity price risk arises from changes in the level or volatility of equity prices  equity index exposure and equity index spreads which affect the value of equity securities 
dlj attempts to cover its exposure to equity price risk by entering into transactions in options and futures designed to reduce dlj s risk profile 
value at risk as a result of the sec s new market risk disclosure rules  dlj developed a company wide value at risk var model late in this var model was not actively used for risk management in but some form of var is expected to be used in the future 
dlj s var model includes virtually all of dlj s trading market risk sensitive instruments and its non trading market risk sensitive instruments 
non trading market risk sensitive instruments are not material and consequently are not reported separately 
dlj has estimated its var using a variance covariance model with a confidence interval of and a one day holding period  based on historical data for one year 
the var number is the statistically expected maximum loss on the fair value of dlj s market sensitive instruments for out of every trading days 
in other words  on out of every trading days  the loss is statistically expected to be greater than the var number 
the model  however  does not state how much greater 
var models are statistical analyses designed to assist in risk management and to provide senior management with a one probabilistic indicator of risk at the firm level 
var numbers should not be interpreted as a predictor of actual results 
dlj s var model has been specifically tailored for its risk management needs and to its risk profile 
the variance covariance method assigns all market instruments to their applicable risk categories such as interest rate exposure  foreign currency exposure  equity exposure  industry type  credit rating  volatility exposure and country exposure 
correlations and volatilities are calculated from historical data series for each risk category and used in the variance covariance matrix to calculate var 
dlj s variance covariance model gives equal weight to earlier and later historical data and assumes that market rate movements over one day are adequately represented by the use of a normal distribution and therefore does not include certain other non normal distributions 
moreover  non linear market movements are not included 
dlj s var model  in common with all other var models  is limited by its assumptions and qualifications 
these limitations include the following i a daily var does not capture the risk inherent in trading positions that cannot be liquidated or hedged in one day  ii var is based on historical market data and assumes that past trading patterns will predict the future  iii it is not possible to perfectly model all inherent market risks  iv correlations between market movements can vary  particularly in times of market stress and v the model s assumption of a normal distribution may not reflect actual market movements 
dlj believes that the use of a company wide var analysis is important advance in its risk management but is aware of the limitations inherent in any statistical analysis 
a var model alone is not a sufficient tool to measure and monitor market risk and  as it has traditionally done  dlj will continue to use other risk management measures  such as stress testing  independent review of position and trading limits and daily revenue reports 
total company wide var was approximately million at december  the company wide var is less than the sum of the individual components below due to the benefit of diversification among the risks presented below 
the var for the three main components of market risk  expressed in terms of theoretical fair values at december   is as follows in millions interest rate risk equity risk foreign currency exchange rate risk credit risk credit risk related to various financing activities is reduced by the industry practice of obtaining and maintaining collateral 
dlj monitors its exposure to counterparty risk on a daily basis through the use of credit exposure information and the monitoring of collateral values 
all counterparties are reviewed on a periodic basis to establish appropriate exposure limits for a variety of transactions 
as appropriate  specific transactions are analyzed to determine the amount of potential exposure that could arise  and the counterparty s credit is reviewed to determine whether it supports such exposure 
in addition to the counterparty s credit status  dlj analyzes market movements that could affect exposure levels 
dlj considers four main factors that may affect trades in determining trading limits the settlement method  the time it will take for a trade to settle ie  the maturity of the trade  the volatility that could affect the value of the instruments involved in the trade  and the size of the trade 
in addition to determining trading limits  dlj actively manages the credit exposure relating to its trading activities by entering into master netting agreements when feasible  monitoring the creditworthiness of counterparties and the related trading limits on an ongoing basis and requesting additional collateral when deemed necessary  diversifying and limiting exposure to individual counterparties and geographic locations  and limiting the duration of exposure 
in certain cases  dlj may also close out transactions or assign them to other counterparties when deemed necessary or appropriate to mitigate credit risks
