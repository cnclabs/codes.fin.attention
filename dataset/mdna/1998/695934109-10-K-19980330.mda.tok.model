overview pairgain technologies  inc pairgain or the company is a leading provider of telecommunications products based on high speed digital subscriber line xdsl technology 
the company designs  manufactures  markets and supports products that allow telecommunications carriers and private network owners to expand the capabilities of copper cable and more efficiently provide high speed digital services to end users over the large existing infrastructure of unconditioned copper wires 
these services enable high speed data transmission for applications such as t e  high speed internet access  telecommuting  local and wide area networking and video conferencing 
the company s first product was pg  a two channel digital subscriber carrier system  which was initially shipped in late in  the company undertook the development of its higain products  which were first shipped in june in june  the company introduced its campus line of products  and in  began shipping its pg flex product  a small subscriber carrier system for delivering up to voice channels over two pair of copper wires

commencing in mid  the company began reducing the average sales prices of its higain products in an effort to increase market demand for its products and in anticipation of expected price competition 
these reductions have been significant  representing reductions of then current prices of as much as in  in and in although future effects of price competition and other competitive pressures inherent in the company s business are uncertain  the company expects to continue to reduce the average sales prices of its higain and other products 
accordingly  the company s ability to maintain or increase revenues will depend in part upon its ability to increase unit sales volumes of existing products and to introduce and sell new products at rates sufficient to compensate for the reduced revenue effect of such continuing reductions in the average sales prices of the company s existing products 
declining average sales prices may also adversely affect gross margins on the company s existing products if the company is unable to fully offset such reductions in average sales prices by reductions in the company s per unit costs 
during  and the company s continuing effort toward cost reduction through engineering design changes  reduced prices for components  increased manufacturing efficiencies and increases in volume resulted in gross margins of in and in and however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to increase unit sales volumes  introduce and sell new products or further reduce its per unit costs in the future

year issue many of the world s computer systems currently record years in a two digit format 
such computer systems will be unable to properly interpret dates beyond the year  which could lead to business disruptions in the us and internationally the year issue 
the potential costs and uncertainties associated with the year issue will depend on a number of factors  including software  hardware and the nature of the industry in which a company operates 
additionally  companies must coordinate with other entities with which they electronically interact  such as customers  creditors and borrowers 
in  the company began a review of its computer systems to assess the potential costs and scope of the year issue 
in january  the company began a project to upgrade its core business applications which support sales and customer service  manufacturing  distribution and finance and accounting  with an implementation target of october additional areas that require conversion are expected to be identified by the end of the first quarter of  with a goal of completing all relevant internal software remediation and testing by the end of year compliance efforts and testing will continue through the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  and test its software for year modifications 
the total cost to the company of these year issue activities has not been and is not anticipated to be material to its financial position or results of operations in any given year 
purchased hardware and software will be capitalized in accordance with normal policy 
personnel and all other costs related to the project are being expensed as incurred 
costs incurred related to the year issue are being funded through operating cash flows 
an assessment of the readiness of external entities with which the company interfaces  such as vendors  counterparties  customers  payment systems and others  is ongoing 
the company has initiated formal communications with all of its significant suppliers and large customers to determine the extent to which the company s interface systems are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remedy their own year issue 
there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted and would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems 
the above was based upon management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  the nature and amount of programming required to upgrade or replace each of the affected programs  the rate and magnitude of related labor and consulting costs and the success of the company s external customers and suppliers in addressing the year issue

these securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations 
an increase in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of the company s fixed income securities

the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk
