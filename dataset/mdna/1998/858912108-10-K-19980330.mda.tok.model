substantially all of the company s services are provided pursuant to customer contracts specifying either scheduled or on call regulated medical waste management services  or both 
contracts with hospitals and other core generators  which may run for more than one year  typically include price escalator provisions which allow for price increases generally tied to an inflation index or set at a fixed percentage
