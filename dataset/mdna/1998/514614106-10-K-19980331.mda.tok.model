accounting matters the company established a disc in in order to defer federal income taxes on its foreign sales 
in late  the internal revenue code the code was amended to limit the benefits of a disc  primarily by imposing an interest charge on the accumulated deferred federal income taxes of a disc 
at the same time  the code was amended to permit the creation of a foreign sales corporation fsc 
under the code  as amended  a portion of a fsc s income is subject to federal income taxes  while a portion is permanently exempt from federal income taxes 
as a result  at some point  the interest charge the company incurs on the deferred federal income taxes of its disc will equal or exceed the taxes it would have incurred had it operated a fsc 
the company  prevented by current tax regulations from maintaining both the disc and a fsc at the same time  has determined it may be advantageous to convert the disc to a fsc 
the conversion to a fsc could take place in at the time of such a conversion  the company will be required to provide for federal income taxes on the million of undistributed earnings of the disc  for which federal income taxes have not previously been provided 
if the disc had been converted on december   it would have resulted in a reduction of approximately  in the company s net earnings 
the company will be able to pay such federal income taxes over a ten year period  thus the company does not anticipate that payments of such federal income taxes will significantly affect the company s cash from operations
