liquidity and capital resources the company has funded its operations through cash from operations  the proceeds of prior equity and debt offerings  borrowings under bank facilities  trade credit and equipment leases 
the company s principal capital requirements are for the opening and building out of targeted new superstores  the purchase of rental inventory  each of which varies based on market conditions and expansion plans and the conversion of the acquired moovies stores 
at april   the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately  the company uses an unclassified balance sheet in its financial statements  and as a result  does not classify its assets or liabilities as current or noncurrent 
if the company were to use a classified balance sheet  a portion of videocassette rental inventories would be classified as noncurrent because they are not assets that are reasonably expected to be completely realized in cash or sold in one year 
the acquisition cost of these inventories  however  would be reflected in current liabilities 
the company believes that classification of videocassette rental inventories as noncurrent assets would be misleading because it would not indicate the level of assets expected to be converted into cash in the next year as a result of rentals or sales of these videocassettes 
for the year ended april   net cash provided by operating activities was approximately  net cash used in investment activities was approximately  consisting primarily of approximately  for new and remodeled stores  and approximately  for the purchase of videocassette inventory for existing and new stores  and for the conversion of stores acquired during the period

the transaction was treated as a tax free exchange for federal income tax purposes and recorded under the purchase method of accounting 
simultaneous with the closing of the moovies transaction  the company announced that a syndicate led by banque paribas had extended it a million credit term loan facility the senior facility 
this senior facility replaced the company s previous line of credit 
the senior facility consists of the following i two term loans totaling million  ii a million capital expenditure line  and  iii a million revolving line 
the company borrowed the million of the two term loans in conjunction with the closing of the merger and the proceeds were used to i refinance approximately  of outstanding indebtedness including accrued interest under the company s previous line of credit  ii refinance approximately  of indebtedness of moovies under moovies previous credit agreement  and  iii pay transaction fees and expenses relating to the merger of approximately  including legal fees  accounting fees  and registration fees 
the capital expenditure line is primarily available to fund the conversion of the acquired moovies stores and integration costs  the opening of new stores and selected acquisitions 
as of april   the company had million outstanding under this facility 
the revolving line is available for normal working capital needs 
as of april  the company had million outstanding under this facility 
amounts borrowed under the senior facility bear interest at variable rates based on the base rate ie the higher of the federal funds rate  plus of or the prime commercial lending rate or the interbank eurodollar rate approximately and per annum  respectively as of april  plus an applicable margin rate that could range from 
to 
amounts currently outstanding at april   had a weighted average rate of 
the senior facility includes negative  affirmative and financial covenants including  but not limited to  minimum pretax earnings  minimum free cash flow  minimum net worth  maximum indebtedness  maximum leverage  minimum fixed charge coverage  a prohibition or restriction on capital expenditures  debt and guarantees  liens and encumbrances on any property  mergers  consolidations  investments  advances  divestitures  change or business or conduct of business  joint ventures  partnerships  the creation of new subsidiaries  dividends  distributions  repurchases or redemptions of outstanding stock including options or warrants  the voluntary prepayment  repurchase redemption or defeasance of debt  and the acquisition  sale or transfer  lease or sale leaseback of assets 
the senior facility is secured by substantially all of the company s assets as well as by pledges of its stock in its subsidiaries  which subsidiaries also have provided guarantees of the company s obligations 
as a result of the one time charges recorded by the company and its operating results for the fourth quarter  the company was not in compliance with certain of the financial covenants of its senior facility for the quarter ended april  the company has received a waiver from the bank syndicate for these non complying conditions for this period 
in addition  because of its expected results for the first quarter of fiscal  the company sought and obtained a similar waiver for the quarter ended july  additionally  the company and the bank syndicate amended the terms of the senior facility to  among other things i revise certain financial covenants  ii increase immediate availability under the senior facility by million for company operating activities  iii increase the overall interest rate by  and  iv reprice warrants held by the bank syndicate to a more current market price 
no assurances can be given that future waivers or amendments will be obtained if the company is unable to maintain a level of operations necessary to meet the covenants and requirements of the senior facility 
if the company is unable to maintain such a level of operations  it will be required to reduce its overall expenditures and expansion plans to comply with the covenants and requirements of the senior facility 
additionally  any failure by the company to maintain its level of operations within the covenants and requirements of the senior facility could cause the company to be in default thereunder  allowing the lenders to take legal action against the company  including but not limited to  the immediate acceleration of payment of borrowed funds  which could materially and adversely affect the company s operations 
the immediate acceleration of debt thereunder or the lack of further borrowing capacity  in whole or in part  would have a material adverse effect on the company s operations and financial condition 
during fiscal  the company expects to focus on maximizing the operating efficiencies of its existing and previously acquired locations and on completing the build out of new stores in locations for which the company has signed lease commitments  rather than on aggressively expanding with new superstores in additional metropolitan areas where it does not presently have locations 
the company has maintained a longstanding and satisfactory relationship with its primary product vendors and has negotiated extended payment terms with several of these vendors 
the loss of its primary product vendors could have a material adverse effect on the company 
assuming the company is able to maintain a satisfactory relationship with its selected vendors and its bank lenders  the company expects that cash from operations  trade credits  equipment leases  available revenue sharing arrangements  and available borrowing under the senior facility will be sufficient to fund future inventory purchases and other working capital needs for the next twelve months  although no assurances can be given that the company will not require additional sources of financing as a result of store openings or build outs currently in progress  disappointing operating results  unavailability under the senior facility as a result of disappointing operating results  or unanticipated cash needs or opportunities 
moreover  no assurances can be given that such additional funds will be available on satisfactory terms  if at all 
if the company is unable to obtain such additional financing  the company may be required to reduce its overall expenditures and the company s ability to maintain or expand its current level of operations could be materially and adversely affected

the company intends to evaluate the possibility of providing loans or limited guarantees for certain franchisee obligations  which in the aggregate are not expected to be material to the company s financial condition 
substantially all company owned stores are in leased premises  except for three stores that are located on premises owned by the company 
the company expects that most future stores will occupy leased premises 
this annual report on form k contains a number of forward looking statements 
any statements contained herein including without limitation statements to the effect that the company or its management believes  expects  anticipates  plans and similar expressions that are not statements of historical fact should be considered forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors that could cause the company s results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements 
these factors include  without limitation  the following cash requirements as a result of the one time charges recorded by the company and its operating results for the fourth quarter  the company was not in compliance with certain of the financial covenants of its senior facility for the quarter ended april  the company has received a waiver from the bank syndicate for these non complying conditions for this period

if the company is unable to maintain such a level of operations  it will be required to reduce its overall expenditures and expansion plans to comply with the covenants and requirements of the senior facility 
additionally  any failure by the company to maintain its level of operations within the covenants and requirements of the senior facility could cause the company to be in default thereunder  allowing the lenders to take legal action against the company  including but not limited to  the immediate acceleration of payment of borrowed funds  which could materially and adversely affect the company s operations 
the immediate acceleration of debt thereunder or the lack of further borrowing capacity  in whole or in part  would have a material adverse effect on the company s operations and financial condition 
during fiscal  the company expects to focus on maximizing the operating efficiencies of its existing and previously acquired locations and on completing the build out of new stores in locations for which the company has signed lease commitments  rather than on aggressively expanding with new superstores in additional metropolitan areas where it does not presently have locations 
the company has maintained a longstanding and satisfactory relationship with its primary product vendors and has negotiated extended payment terms with several of these vendors 
the loss of its primary product vendors could have a material adverse effect on the company 
assuming the company is able to maintain a satisfactory relationship with its selected vendors and its bank lenders  the company expects that cash from operations  trade credits  equipment leases  available revenue sharing arrangements  and available borrowing under the senior facility will be sufficient to fund future inventory purchases and other working capital needs for the next twelve months  although no assurances can be given that the company will not require additional sources of financing as a result of store openings or build outs currently in progress  disappointing operating results  unavailability under the senior facility as a result of disappointing operating results  or unanticipated cash needs or opportunities 
moreover  no assurances can be given that such additional funds will be available on satisfactory terms  if at all 
if the company is unable to obtain such additional financing  the company may be required to reduce its overall expenditures and the company s ability to maintain or expand its current level of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
integration of former moovies locations the company completed the acquisition of moovies  inc in march  integrating the operations of the former moovies locations including inventory purchasing  distribution of inventory to stores  marketing plans and activities  employee hiring and training and expansion strategy is a time consuming process 
although the company now has all of the acquired locations on line with company information and computer systems and expects to adjust location layout and marketing by late fall  no assurances can be given as to the timing of the integration of acquired locations or that the integration of the locations will result in immediate improvement in the company s operating results 
moreover  the integration of the acquired locations requires the dedication of management resources  which may distract attention from the day to day business of the company 
the inability of management to successfully or expeditiously integrate the acquired locations could have a material adverse effect on the business and operating results of the company 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results the company has experienced in the past  and may continue to experience in the future  fluctuations in its quarterly operating results 
no assurance can be given that the company will have positive earnings in any quarter  or that earnings in any particular quarter will not fall short of either a prior fiscal quarter or investors expectations 
factors such as the number of new store openings newer stores generally are less profitable than mature stores  public acceptance and interest in new release titles  weather particularly on weekends and holidays  the mix of products rented and sold  pricing actions of competitors  special or unusual events affecting retailers in general  the level of advertising and promotional expenses  seasonality  and one time charges associated with acquisitions or other events could contribute to quarterly variability in operating results 
in addition  the company s expense levels are based in part on expectations of future sales levels  and a shortfall in expected sales could therefore result in a disproportionate decrease in net income 
significant future charges to earnings arising from amortization of goodwill at april   the company had approximately  of goodwill on its balance sheet that resulted primarily from the acquisition of video rental stores  which will be amortized over years 
the company expects that its operating results for future quarters over the next years will reflect quarterly  non cash charges of approximately  for amortization of goodwill from these acquisitions 
the company also anticipates that future acquisitions will involve the recording of a significant amount of goodwill on its balance sheet  which will be amortized over varying periods of time of up to years 
competition the video rental industry is highly competitive 
the company competes with other video retail stores  including blockbuster entertainment  a division of viacom  inc blockbuster and other superstores  and with supermarkets  pharmacies  convenience stores  bookstores  mass merchants  mail order operations  vending machines and other retailers  as well as with noncommercial sources such as libraries 
in addition to competing with other video retailers  the company competes with other leisure time activities  especially entertainment activities such as movie theaters  sporting events  network television and cable television 
the company also competes with other distribution channels for studio movies  including pay per view television on basic cable service  which currently offer only a limited number of channels and monthly movie selections 
recently developed digital compression technology combined with fiber optics and other technology will eventually permit cable companies  direct broadcast satellite companies and other telecommunications companies to transmit a much greater number of movies to homes at scheduled intervals throughout the day 
ultimately  these technologies could lead to the availability of movies to the consumer on demand 
certain cable and other telecommunications companies have tested and are continuing to test movie on demand services in some markets 
some of the company s competitors  including blockbuster  have entered into direct revenue sharing arrangements with the major motion picture studios 
such arrangements could allow these competitors to order and stock a greater number of new release and other titles  thus increasing competition in those areas in which each of the company and its competitors have retail locations and diminishing the potential benefits of similar revenue sharing arrrangements entered into by the company  which could have a material adverse effect on operations 
in addition  certain of the company s larger  better capitalized competitors may seek to acquire some of the same video specialty stores that the company seeks to acquire 
such competition for acquisitions would likely increase acquisition prices and related costs and result in fewer attractive acquisition opportunities  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s growth 
the company s franchise operations compete with numerous franchise operations in many industries that have significantly greater financial and human resources and more experience in selling franchises than does the company 
potential franchisees may believe that these franchisers offer greater opportunities for success than the company 
expansion the company currently intends to focus on maximizing the operating efficiencies of existing locations and on opening a very limited number of new stores in selected locations rather than aggressively expanding new superstores in additional metropolitan areas where it does not presently have locations 
expansion is  and is expected to remain  dependent on a number of factors  including cash flow  the availability of bank and other financing resources  the ability to hire  train  retain and assimilate competent management and store level employees  the ability to identify new markets in which it can successfully compete  to locate suitable superstore sites and negotiate acceptable lease terms and to adapt its purchasing  management information and other systems to accommodate expanded operations 
expansion is also dependent on the timely fulfillment by landlords and others of their contractual obligations  the maintenance of construction schedules and the speed at which local zoning and construction permits can be obtained 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to undertake any substantial near term expansion with new superstores or that such expansion  if possible  will be profitable 
any expansion  including growth through acquisitions  will place increasing pressure on the management controls of the company 
no assurance can be given that the company s new stores will achieve sales or profitability comparable to its existing stores 
possible adverse effect of new technologies on the video rental business the company also currently competes with pay per view cable television systems 
recently developed digital compression technology combined with fiber optics and other technology will eventually permit cable companies  direct broadcast satellite companies and other telecommunications companies to transmit a much greater selection of movies to homes at scheduled intervals throughout the day 
ultimately  these technologies could lead to the availability of movies on demand to the consumer 
certain cable and other telecommunications companies have tested and are continuing to test movie on demand services in some markets 
technological advances could have a material adverse effect on the business of the company 
changes in studio distribution and pricing changes in the manner in which movies are marketed by the studios that produce them  primarily related to an earlier release of movie titles to alternative distribution channels  could substantially decrease the demand for video rentals  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  changes in the movie studios wholesale pricing structure for videos could result in a competitive disadvantage for all video specialty stores  including those of the company 
supply relationships in addition to traditional inventory purchasing in july   the company entered into a direct license revenue sharing agreement with a major motion picture studio 
under the terms of the agreement  the company can choose titles that it wants and may obtain them directly from the studio  although the company remains able to obtain the titles through regular distribution channels on a title by title basis 
for each title obtained  the company will share the greater of an agreed upon percentage of the rental revenue or dollar amount per rental transaction  which percentage declines over a period of weeks following the release of the title for video rental 
the company is already obtaining titles under this agreement during fiscal and is aggressively pursuing additional direct licensing revenue sharing agreements with other studios  although no assurances can be given that such agreements will be obtained 
video update believes that such revenue sharing agreements could be a cost effective source for larger orders of an individual title  particularly new release titles 
such agreements would enable video update to order larger numbers  up to three times the normal order  of copies of a particular title to satisfy customer demand than could be cost effective if the copies were purchased for rental 
to obtain the full benefits of such revenue sharing agreements  the company must correctly identify the new release and other titles that it should offer in each location on this basis 
no assurances can be given that the company will be able to use such revenue sharing agreements to obtain its intended results 
consumer acceptance of new release movie titles the company depends significantly on availability and consumer acceptance of new release videocassette titles available for rental 
to the extent that available new release titles fail to stimulate consumer interest and retail traffic  operating results could be materially adversely affected 
management of growth the company s business  including sales  number of stores and number of employees  has grown dramatically over the past several years 
in addition  the company has consummated a number of significant acquisitions in the last few years  and may make additional acquisitions in the future 
this internal growth  together with the acquisitions made  have resulted in integration costs and placed significant demand on the company s management and operational systems 
to manage its growth effectively  the company will be required to continue to upgrade its operational and financial systems  expand its management team and increase and manage its employee base 
seasonality and other factors the company s business is somewhat seasonal  with revenues in april  may  september and october generally lower than in other months of the year 
future operating results may be affected by many factors  including variations in the number and timing of store openings and acquisitions  weather particularly on weekends and holidays  the public acceptance of new release titles available for rental  competition  marketing programs  special or unusual events and other factors that may affect retailers in general 
revenues may be reduced temporarily if viewers prefer to watch such events rather than rent videocassettes 
also  any concentration of new superstore openings and the related pre opening costs in any particular fiscal quarter could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results for that quarter 
year like many other companies  video update is currently in the process of evaluating its computer software and databases to determine whether or not modifications will be required to prevent problems related to the year these problems  which have been widely reported in the media  could cause malfunctions in certain software and databases with respect to dates on or after january   unless corrected 
the costs associated with this process have been and are being expensed as incurred and  at the present time  have not been and are not expected to be material in amount 
franchise sales the sale of franchises is regulated by various state laws as well as by the federal trade commission the ftc 
the ftc requires that franchisors make extensive disclosure to prospective franchisees but does not require registration 
a number of states require registration or disclosure in connection with franchise offers and sales 
in addition  several states have franchise relationship laws or business opportunity laws that limit the ability of franchisors to terminate franchise agreements or to withhold consent to the renewal or transfer of these agreements 
although the franchising operations are not materially adversely affected  to date  by such existing regulations  the management of the company cannot predict the effect any future legislation or regulation may have on its business operations or financial condition 
dependence on key personnel the company s future success depends to a significant extent on the continued contributions of daniel a 
potter  the company s chairman and chief executive officer  and john m 
bedard  the company s president 
the loss of the services of either of these officers could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s continued growth and profitability also depends on its ability to attract  motivate  and retain other management personnel  including qualified store managers 
no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in attracting  motivating and retaining such personnel 
retention of employees the success of the company will depend in part upon the retention of key employees
