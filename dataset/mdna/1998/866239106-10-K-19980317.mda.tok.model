development activity the company s developments in process at december  are summarized as follows dollars in thousands total estimated anticipated apartment estimated cost to cost to construction community homes costs date complete completion summit stonefield yardley  pa    q summit lake i raleigh  nc    q summit ballantyne ii charlotte  nc    q summit sedgebrook ii charlotte  nc   q summit doral miami  florida    q summit fair lakes i fairfax  va    q summit governor s village chapel hill  nc    q summit new albany i columbus  oh    q summit westwood raleigh  nc    q other development and construction costs  estimated cost to complete the development communities represents substantially all of the company s material commitments for capital expenditures at december certain factors affecting the performance of development communities the company is optimistic about the operating prospects of the communities under construction even with the increased supply of newly constructed apartment homes of comparable quality in many of its markets 
as with any development community  there are uncertainties and risks associated with the development of the communities described above 
while the company has prepared development budgets and has estimated completion and stabilization target dates based on what it believes are reasonable assumptions in light of current conditions  there can be no assurance that actual costs will not exceed current budgets or that the company will not experience construction delays due to the unavailability of materials  weather conditions or other events 
other development risks include the possibility of incurring additional cost or liability resulting from defects in construction materials and the possibility that financing may not be available on favorable terms  or at all  to pursue or complete development activities 
similarly  market conditions at the time these communities become available for leasing will affect the rental rates that may be charged and the period of time necessary to achieve stabilization  which could make one or more of the development communities unprofitable or result in achieving stabilization later than currently anticipated 
in addition  the company is conducting feasibility and other pre development work for eleven communities 
the company could abandon the development of any one or more of these potential communities in the event that it determines that market conditions do not support development  financing is not available on favorable terms or other circumstances prevent development 
similarly  there can be no assurance that if the company does pursue one or more of these potential communities that it will be able to complete construction within the currently estimated development budgets or that construction can be started at the time currently anticipated 
capitalization of fixed assets and property improvements the company has established a policy of capitalizing those expenditures relating to acquiring new assets  materially enhancing the value of an existing asset  or substantially extending the useful life of an existing asset 
all expenditures necessary to maintain a community in ordinary operating condition including replacement carpets are expensed as incurred 
the company has a capital expenditure replacement program whereby various physical components are replaced as to maintain the communities in normal operating condition 
certain physical components may be replaced other than at regular inspection intervals when extraordinary wear has occurred 
the company also makes capital expenditures for new physical components if these expenditures will produce sufficient revenue enhancements as to achieve acceptable returns on invested capital 
there are currently no material commitments relative to renovation or improvements at existing facilities 
capitalized expenditures for the years ended december   and are summarized as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  acquisition of communities    construction of communities    capitalized interest    non recurring capital expenditures   recurring capital expenditures exterior painting   other    total recurring capital expenditures    includes the assumption of million  million and million of debt in  and  respectively 
includes the issuance of units of the operating partnership and shares of common stock with a value of million in in addition  includes conversion of equity investment into fixed assets of million in conjunction with the purchase of summit plantation in and the issuance of million units of the operating partnership with a value of million in includes the issuance of million and  of units in the operating partnership for the acquisition of land in and  respectively 
construction of communities was funded primarily by development loans  equity offering proceeds and borrowings under the credit facilities 
other additions and improvements were funded primarily by community operations and the credit facilities 
inflation substantially all of the leases at the communities are for a term of one year or less  which  coupled with the relatively high occupancy rates  may enable the company to seek increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or commencement of new leases 
the short term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk to the company of the adverse effect of inflation 
year the year compliance issue concerns the inability of computerized information systems to accurately calculate  store or use a date after this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations 
the company s primary uses of software systems are its corporate accounting and property on site software 
the company s corporate accounting system is widely used in the real estate industry 
a version upgrade  scheduled to be installed in the second quarter of  is designed to be year compliant 
the company is replacing its current property on site software with a new software system designed to be year compliant 
this new software is also widely used in the real estate industry 
the implementation of the new on site software system started in the first quarter of and is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of both the corporate accounting system upgrade and the new property on site system were planned changes that would have been done regardless of year compliance issues 
the company believes that the risk of year compliance issues having a material impact on its operations is not significant 
the primary cost of year compliance will be the cost of the new property on site software installation which is estimated to be approximately  however  if the company s efforts to upgrade its corporate accounting software and to replace its current property on site software are not completed on time  or if the costs associated therewith exceed the company s current estimates  the year issue could have a material impact on the company s ability to meet its financial and reporting requirements and or on its financial results 
further  no estimates can be made as to any potential adverse impact resulting from the failure of residents or third party service providers and vendors to prepare for the year the cost and timing of third party year compliance is not within the company s control and no assurances can be given with respect to the cost or timing of such efforts or the potential effects of any failure to comply 
funds from operations the white paper on funds from operations approved by the board of governors of nareit in march defines funds from operations as net income loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the company computes funds from operations in accordance with the standards established by the white paper  which may differ from the methodology for calculating funds from operations utilized by other equity reits  and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
funds available for distribution is defined as funds from operations less capital expenditures funded by operations 
the company s methodology for calculating funds available for distribution may differ from the methodology for calculating funds available for distribution utilized by other reits  and accordingly  may not be comparable to other reits 
funds from operations and funds available for distribution do not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion  debt service obligations  property acquisitions  development  dividends and distributions or other commitments and uncertainties 
funds from operations and funds available for distribution should not be considered as alternatives to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of the company s financial performance or to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor are they indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make dividends distributions 
the company believes funds from operations and funds available for distribution are helpful to investors as measures of the performance of the company because  along with cash flows from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities  they provide investors with an understanding of the ability of the company to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures 
funds from operations and funds available for distribution are calculated as follows dollars in thousands net income    extraordinary items  net of minority interest minority interest of unitholders in operating partnership    net gain on sale of assets  adjusted net income    depreciation real estate assets    summit plantation funds from operations    recurring capital expenditures    funds available for distribution    non recurring capital expenditures   cash flow provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    weighted average shares outstanding basic    weighted average shares and units outstanding basic    weighted average shares outstanding diluted    weighted average shares and units outstanding diluted    recurring capital expenditures include exterior paint in the amount of million  million and  in  and  respectively

recurring capital expenditures are expected to be funded from operations and consist primarily of exterior painting  new appliances  vinyl  blinds  tile  and wallpaper 
in contrast  non recurring capital expenditures  such as major improvements  new garages and access gates  are expected to be funded by financing activities and therefore are not included in the calculation of funds available for distribution
