item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition management s discussion and analysis of the major elements of the company s consolidated balance sheets and statements of earnings should be reviewed in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes  and selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report 
on november   through an exchange of  shares of stock  the company acquired southlake bancshares  inc and its subsidiary  texas national bank 
the southlake bancshares transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
the results of southlake bancshares are included in the consolidated financial statements for  however  prior period financial data has not been restated due to immateriality 
on september   the company s subsidiary bank in san angelo acquired certain assets of texas commerce bank san angelo for million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities primarily deposits 
these factors should be considered when making comparisons to prior year operating results and period end balances 
performance summary net earnings for were million  an all time high and an increase of million over the million earned in net earnings for amounted to million and included million in nonrecurring gains 
increased net interest income resulting from growth in earning assets and higher noninterest income were the primary factors contributing to the earnings improvement in both and on a per share basis  earnings amounted to as compared to for in  the company earned per share which included approximately per share resulting from nonrecurring gains 
return on average assets for was as compared to for and excluding nonrecurring gains for return on average equity for was compared to for and excluding nonrecurring gains for net interest income net interest income is the spread between interest income on earning assets  consisting primarily of loans and securities  and the interest expense on liabilities used to fund those assets  primarily interest bearing deposits 
in this discussion  net interest income is presented on a fully tax equivalent basis  which permits comparability of data through recognition of tax savings realized on tax exempt income 
net interest income on a tax equivalent basis was million in as compared to million in and million in these year to year net increases represent changes in both the volume of average earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and interest rates

nonaccrual loans are included in loans 
provision and allowance for possible loan losses the allowance for losses is the amount deemed by management to be adequate to provide for possible losses on loans that may become uncollectable 
reviews of general loss experience and the performance of specific credits are conducted in determining reserve adequacy and required provision expense 
the provision for loan losses amounted to million in as compared to million in and thousand in net charge offs during totaled million  virtually unchanged from the prior year amount 
as a percent of average loans  net charge offs amounted to as compared to for a key indicator of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is the ratio of the allowance to nonperforming assets which amounted to at december   as compared to at december  nonperforming assets at december   totaled million as compared to million the prior year end

excluding approximately million which resulted from acquisitions  noninterest expense was up 
an important measure in determining effectiveness in managing noninterest expense is the efficiency ratio  which is calculated by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and noninterest income 
excluding gains on sale of foreclosed assets  the company s efficiency ratios were  and in  and  respectively 
salaries and employee benefits for totaled million  up million  or  over the prior year 
approximately million of the increase related to acquisitions 
on a combined basis  net occupancy and equipment expense was up thousand with depreciation and property taxes being the significant factors contributing to the increase 
table presents major categories of other noninterest expense 
noninterest expense in amounted to million  which was up million 
approximately million of the increase related to a purchase acquisition finalized in january of occupancy expense in was up thousand with the increase resulting primarily from acquisitions and the opening of a new bank building in stephenville 
fdic expense in decreased million due to the insurance fund reaching its target level

the approximate effects of each type of difference that gave rise to the company s deferred tax assets and liabilities at december  and  are provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the most significant assumption relied upon by management in concluding that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets  net of the recorded valuation allowance  will be realized in the future is the recent history of taxable income generated by the company and the subsidiary bank to which the net operating loss carryforward relates 
on a consolidated basis  taxable income amounted to approximately million  million  and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the use of the net operating loss carryforward is conditioned upon taxable income generated by the subsidiary bank 
the net operating loss carryforward was acquired in the purchase of the stock of the subsidiary bank  and under applicable internal revenue service regulations regarding change of control  their usage is limited to a predetermined amount in each future period 
the net operating loss carryforward approximates million at december   with a usage limitation of thousand per year 
the net operating loss carryforward expires in the years through taxable income generated by the subsidiary bank before the net operating loss carryforward amounted to approximately million  million  and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the valuation allowance was established because full utilization of the net operating loss carryforward is dependent on future taxable income in years where the company is unable to determine that it is more likely than not that taxable income of the subsidiary bank will be available prior to expiration 
investment securities at december   the investment securities portfolio totaled million as compared to million the prior year end 
at december   securities with an amortized cost of million were classified as securities held to maturity and securities with a market value of million were classified as securities available for sale 
the portfolio is comprised primarily of u 
s 
treasury and us government corporations and agencies securities with relative short maturities 
the company did not hold any cmos that entail higher risks than standard mortgage backed securities 
total investment securities at year end included structured notes with an amortized cost of million and an approximate market value of million 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides detail disclosures relating to the maturities and estimated fair values of the investment portfolio at december  and loans total loans at december   amounted to million  up million  or  from year end internal loan growth amounted to million  or  and acquisitions accounted for the remaining million of growth 
when compared to the prior year end totals  consumer loans and commercial loans show increases of million and million  respectively 
as shown in table below  the composition  or percent of total loans each classification represents  was relatively unchanged from year to year 
the loan portfolio is comprised of loans made to businesses  individuals  and farm and ranch operations located in the primary trade areas served by the company s subsidiary banks 
real estate loans represent loans primarily for new home construction and owner occupied real estate 
the structure of loans in the real estate mortgage classification generally provides repricing intervals to minimize the interest rate risk inherent in fixed rate mortgage loans 
table composition of loans s omitted december  december  amount of total amount of total commercial  financial  and agricultural   real estate construction   real estate mortgage   consumer   deposits deposits held by subsidiary banks represent the company s primary source of funding 
substantially all of the deposits are considered core deposits  that is  deposits that are not subject to material fluctuations from customer withdrawal related to market rate changes 
at december   total deposits amounted to billion  an increase of million  or  over the year end total 
approximately million of the growth resulted from acquisitions

banking system regulators measure capital adequacy by means of the risk based capital ratio and leverage ratio 
the risk based capital rules provide for the weighting of assets and off balance sheet commitments and contingencies according to prescribed risk categories ranging from to 
regulatory capital is then divided by risk weighted assets to determine the risk adjusted capital ratios 
the leverage ratio is computed by dividing shareholders equity less intangibles by quarter to date average assets less intangibles 
regulatory minimums for risk based and leverage ratios are and  respectively 
at december   the company s total risk based and leverage ratios were and  respectively  as compared to a total risk based ratio of and a leverage ratio of at the end of lower ratios at the close of reflect the company s asset growth and additional goodwill resulting from the purchase and assumption transaction 
interest rate risk interest rate risk results when the maturity or repricing intervals of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are different 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is managed primarily through the company s strategy of selecting the types and terms of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which generate favorable earnings  while limiting the potential negative effects of changes in market interest rates 
the company uses no off balance sheet financial instruments to manage interest rate risk 
each subsidiary bank has an asset liability committee which monitors interest rate risk and compliance with investment policies 
interest sensitivity gap and simulation analysis are among the ways that the subsidiary banks track interest rate risk 
table sets forth the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities as of december   and sets forth the repricing dates of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of that date  as well as the company s interest rate sensitivity gap percentages for the periods presented 
the table is based upon assumptions as to when assets and liabilities will reprice in a changing interest rate environment  and since such assumptions can be no more than estimates  certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing within a stated period may  in fact  mature or reprice at different times and at different volumes than those estimated 
also  the renewal or repricing of certain assets and liabilities can be discretionary and subject to competitive and other pressures 
therefore  the following table does not and cannot necessarily indicate the actual future impact of general interest rate movements on the company s net interest income 
table interest sensitivity analysis s omitted estimated beyond total fair value loans fixed rate loans         average interest rate adjustable rate loans    average interest rate investment securities fixed rate securities         average interest rate other earning assets adjustable rate other    average interest rate total financial assets         average interest rate deposits fixed rate deposits        average interest rate adjustable rate deposits    average interest rate note payable floating rate note payable    average interest rate total financial liabilities        average interest rate interest sensitivity gap        cumulative interest sensitivity gap        ratio of interest sensitive assets to interest sensitive liabilities cumulative ratio of interest sensitive assets to interest sensitive liabilities cumulative interest sensitivity gap as a percent of earning assets in the event market interest rates increase basis points  management estimates that the company s net interest income would likely increase when compared to the prior month period 
if interest rates decreased basis points  net interest income would likely decrease when compared to the prior month period 
these are good faith estimates assuming all other factors do not change materially  and  in management s belief  are not necessarily indicative of what actually could occur in the event of immediate interest rate increases or decreases of this magnitude 
management believes that it is unlikely that such changes would occur in a short time period 
as interest bearing assets and liabilities reprice at different time frames and proportions to market interest rate movements  various assumptions must be made based on historical relationships of these variables in reaching any conclusion 
since these correlations are based on competitive and market conditions  future results would  in management s belief  be different from the foregoing estimates and such results could be material 
liquidity liquidity is the ability of the company to meet cash demands as they arise 
such needs can develop from loan demand  deposit withdrawals or acquisition opportunities 
asset liquidity is provided by cash and assets which are readily marketable or which will mature in the near future 
liquid assets include cash  federal funds sold  and short term investments in time deposits in banks 
liquidity is also provided by access to funding sources which include core depositors and correspondent banks that maintain accounts with and sell federal funds to subsidiary banks of the company 
given the strong core deposit base and relatively low loan deposit ratios maintained at the subsidiary banks  management considers the current liquidity position to be adequate 
parent company funding sources and dividends the company s ability to fund various operating expenses  dividends  and cash acquisitions is generally dependent on parent company only earnings  cash reserves and funds derived from its subsidiaries 
these funds historically have been produced by intercompany dividends and management fees that are limited to reimbursement of actual expenses 
it is anticipated that the company s recurring cash sources will continue to include dividends and management fees from subsidiaries 
at december   approximately million was available for the payment of intercompany dividends by the subsidiary banks without the prior approval of regulatory agencies 
also at december   the company had million available under a line of credit with an unaffiliated financial institution 
the company does not anticipate any significant change in its policy for cash dividends  which have amounted to   and of net earnings  respectively  in  and year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in miscalculations 
the company has assessed financial and operational systems and developed plans to address systems modifications 
the company is also communicating with others with which it conducts business to help identify and resolve the year issue 
the total cost associated with the required modifications is not expected to be material to the company s consolidated results of operations and financial position and is being expensed as incurred
