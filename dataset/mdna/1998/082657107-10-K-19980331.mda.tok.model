in an effort to increase its presence in the united states  the registrant has entered into a letter of intent to purchase domestic and international rights to a portfolio of branded drugs and a manufacturing facility in wisconsin from schwarz pharma inc although no definitive agreements have been finalized  the letter of intent was recently amended to take into consideration the possible transfer of control of the registrant s spanish subsidiary  laboratorios belmac  to schwarz pharma

the registrant incurred a net loss of  for the year ended december  the registrant intends to continue to focus its efforts on business activities which management believes should result in operating profits in the future  of which there can be no assurance 
to improve its results  the registrant s management will focus on increasing higher margin pharmaceutical and health care product sales  controlling expenses through its austerity program  careful prioritization of research and development projects resulting in continued low overall research and development expenditures  and potentially acquiring marketable products or profitable companies in the united states or europe that are compatible with the registrant s strategy for growth

sales and cost of sales 
the decrease in revenues is primarily attributable to an decrease in sales by the registrant s french subsidiary  chimos lbf  to  the decrease in chimos lbf s revenues is due to its divestiture on june   combined with a decrease in its sales prior to the divestiture 
this decrease was partially offset by a increase in sales calculated in local currency by the registrant s spanish subsidiary  laboratorios belmac 
however  fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates reduced the increase in sales to  when reported in us dollars  to  the registrant s revenues began to decline beginning in the second quarter of  due to the march  expiration of its distribution agreement for the product  ceredase  which accounted for approximately of its revenues in the year ended december  ceredase gross margins  as a percent of sales  were approximately 
gross margins for the year ended december  improved to when compared to gross margins of in the prior year  primarily as a result of the higher proportion of sales from laboratorios belmac  whose sales generate significantly higher gross margins than those of chimos lbf  as well as the loss of low margin ceredase sales 
chimos lbf generated relatively low gross margins approximately for the year ended december  compared to laboratorios belmac  which experienced substantially higher margins approximately for the year ended december  
operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the same period in the prior year 
chimos lbf s divestiture in june resulted in lower selling  general and administrative expenses in france  however  this decrease was partially offset by increased selling expenses incurred by the spanish subsidiary to support the increase in sales volume generated during the year ended december  the registrant intends to continue its efforts to control general and administrative expenses as part of its austerity program in its effort to reach and maintain profitability 
research and development expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the prior year 
the research and development expenditures for the year ended december  were primarily related to bio equivalency studies  which are necessary in order to obtain approval to export products from spain to other countries

the registrant intends to continue to carefully manage its research and development expenditures in view of its limited resources 
depreciation and amortization expenses were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period of the prior year 
the decrease is primarily due to i the divestiture of chimos lbf  and ii the disposal of certain fixed assets during as a result of the registrant s move to smaller  more cost effective office space 
other income expense 
interest expense was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the same period of the prior year 
the decrease reflects primarily the effect of retiring high yield promissory notes in february  using proceeds from the public offering  thereby lowering the effective interest rate on outstanding debt  offset by higher outstanding balances on short term borrowings  which are used to finance working capital needs 
interest income was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the same period of the prior year 
the slight increase is due to interest earned on higher short term interest bearing investment balances in the current year  which resulted from the proceeds of the exercise of approximately  class a warrants during the fourth quarter of other income expenses for the year ended december  includes a provision for loss on disposition of subsidiary  which totals  including realized exchange loss of  due to fluctuations in the currency exchange rates used to translate the foreign currency financial statements and a loss of  recognized upon the sale of chimos lbf

the registrant utilizes software and related technologies throughout its business that will be affected by the year problem which is common to most businesses  and concerns the inability of information systems  primarily computer software programs  to recognize and process date sensitive information properly as the year approaches 
an internal study is currently under way to determine the full scope and related costs of the year problem to ensure that the registrant s systems continue to meet its internal needs and those of its customers 
the registrant currently believes it will be able to modify or replace its affected systems in time to minimize any detrimental effects on operations 
while it is not possible  at present  to give an accurate estimate of the cost of this project  the registrant expects that such costs could possibly be material to its results of operations in one or more fiscal quarters or years  but will not have a material adverse impact on the long term results of operations  liquidity or consolidated financial position of the registrant 
system maintenance or software modification costs will be expensed as incurred  while the costs of new software will be capitalized and amortized over the software s useful life 
fiscal year ended december  versus fiscal year ended december  the registrant reported revenues of  and a net loss of  or 
per common share for the year ended december  compared to revenues of  and a net loss of  or

sales and cost of sales 
the decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to a decrease in sales by the registrant s french subsidiary  chimos lbf  to  which was partially offset by a increase in sales by the registrant s spanish subsidiary  laboratorios belmac  to  for the year ended december  as previously reported  revenues declined beginning in the second quarter of  due to the march  expiration of its distribution agreement for the product ceredase  which accounted for approximately of the registrant s revenues in the year ended december  ceredase gross margins  as a percent of sales  were approximately 
gross margins for the year ended december  improved to when compared to gross margins of in the prior year  primarily as a result of the more rapid rate of growth in sales at laboratorios belmac  whose sales generated significantly higher gross margins than those of chimos lbf  as well as the loss of low margin ceredase sales 
the registrant s distribution operations in france  chimos lbf  generated relatively low gross margins approximately for the year ended december  as opposed to the registrant s spanish subsidiary  laboratorios belmac  which experienced substantially higher margins approximately for the year ended december  operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the prior year 
overall  selling  general and administrative expenses increased and the composition changed as a result of increased selling expenses incurred by the spanish subsidiary  which were necessary in order to sustain the increase in sales volume that the spanish sales force had generated in the year ended december  this increase was offset in part by a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses by chimos lbf  primarily due to the loss of ceredase sales  during the year ended december  research and development expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the prior year 
the registrant s management has shifted the focus from research and development to a more cost effective strategy of acquiring late stage development compounds that can be marketed within one year as well as currently marketed products 
as a result of this shift in operations  the registrant has decreased its research and development spending over the past few years 
research and development activities have been performed  under contract  by various universities and consulting research laboratories 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the prior year  primarily due to the disposal of certain fixed assets during the quarters ended june and september  as a result of the registrant s move to smaller  more cost effective office space

the registrant incurred an extraordinary charge of  representing the unamortized discount and issuance costs at the date of repayment of the notes from its october private placements 
interest income was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the prior year

although the registrant reported a decrease in sales  the improved gross margins of and controlled spending with respect to operating expenses in the year ended december   resulted in a  improvement in its loss from operations from  in the prior year to  for the year ended december  the loss from operations included a charge of  for a provision for goodwill impairment related to the proposed chimos disposition 
this improvement was offset by interest expense associated with i the notes sold by the registrant in its october private placements  and ii the debentures sold in the february public offering  resulting in a net loss of  or 
per common share for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of  or 
per common share for the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources total assets increased from  at december  to  at december   while common stockholders equity increased from  at december  to  at december  the increase in common stockholders equity reflects primarily the exercise of approximately  class a warrants during the fourth quarter of  partially offset by the fluctuation in the exchange rates of european currencies compared to the us dollar and the loss incurred by the registrant for the year ended december  the registrant s working capital increased from  at december  to  at december  the increase in working capital is primarily attributable to the fourth quarter exercise of approximately  class a warrants  partially offset by the fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates and the net cash used by the registrant s operating activities 
cash and cash equivalents increased from  at december  to  at december   primarily as the combined result of proceeds from the exercise  during the fourth quarter of  of approximately  class a warrants and proceeds from short term borrowings and stock options warrants exercises  offset by cash used for operational purposes and  the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash balances 
included in cash and cash equivalents are approximately  of short term investments considered to be cash equivalents 
accounts receivable decreased from  at december  to  at december  due to a combination of the disposition of the registrant s french subsidiary and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  which were offset by higher receivables resulting from increased sales in spain 
the registrant has not experienced any material delinquent accounts 
inventories decreased to  at december  compared to  at december   due to the disposition of the registrant s french subsidiary and the fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates  which were partially offset by an increase in inventory levels in spain to accommodate the increase in sales volume 
prepaid expenses and other current assets increased from  at december  to  at december  due to a combination of the disposition of the registrant s french subsidiary and the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  which were offset by a combination of i expenditures for marketing and promotional items which will be utilized by the registrant s spanish subsidiary during and ii pre payment for certain bio equivalency studies which are scheduled to take place during accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased from  at december  to  at december  due to the combined effect of i the disposition of the registrant s french subsidiary  ii the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  and iii the reversal of an amount owed for a drug license in spain  for which the proposed purchase by the registrant was canceled  partially offset by income taxes payable totaling  fixed assets  net decreased from  at december  to  at december   due to recurring depreciation charges and a fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates 
drug licenses and related costs  net decreased from  at december  to  at december   due to a combination of recurring amortization charges  the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the cancellation of the proposed purchase of a drug license in spain 
other non current assets increased from  at december  to  at december  primarily due to capitalization of approximately  of pre acquisition costs  including a non refundable  deposit paid for the proposed acquisition of certain assets owned by schwarz pharma  inc and other possible acquisitions  offset by amortization costs related to the public offering 
long term debt increased from  at december  to  at december   due primarily to accretion recorded on the debentures issued in the february public offering 
investing activities provided net cash of  during the year ended december  financing activities for the year ended december  provided net cash of  and operating activities for the year ended december  used net cash of  seasonality 
in the past  the registrant has experienced lower sales in certain calendar quarters of each year  although the registrant has not experienced fluctuations due to seasonality during the year ended december  and does not currently expect fluctuations due to seasonality 
should the registrant begin large sales of a pharmaceutical product whose sales are seasonal  seasonality of sales may become more significant 
currency 
a substantial amount of the registrant s business is conducted in europe and is therefore influenced by the extent to which there are fluctuations in the dollar s value against other currencies 
the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on long lived assets for the year ended december  was a decrease of  and the cumulative historical effect was a decrease of  as reflected in the registrant s consolidated balance sheets in the liabilities and stockholders equity section 
although exchange rates fluctuated significantly in recent years  the registrant does not believe that the effect of foreign currency fluctuation is material to the registrant s results of operations as the expenses related to much of the registrant s foreign currency revenues are in the same currency as such revenues 
however  the carrying value of assets and reported values can be materially impacted by foreign currency translation 
nonetheless  the registrant does not plan to modify its business practices 
the registrant relies primarily upon financing activities to fund the operations of the registrant in the united states 
in the event that the registrant is required to fund united states operations or cash needs with funds generated in spain  currency rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant impact on the registrant 
however  at the present time  the registrant does not anticipate altering its business plans and practices to compensate for future currency fluctuations
