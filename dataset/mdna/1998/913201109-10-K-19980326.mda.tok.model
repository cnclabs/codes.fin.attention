general the company was formed in june when the founding shareholders of matrix financial and united financial  subsidiaries of the company  exchanged all of the outstanding capital stock of those two entities for shares of the company in a series of transactions that were each accounted for as a pooling of interests 
in september  the company acquired dona ana savings and loan association  fsb which was subsequently renamed matrix capital bank

the company formed uss in june and ucm in december in february  the company acquired vintage in a pooling of interests and  accordingly  no goodwill was recorded and the consolidated financial statements of the company for the prior periods have been restated 
the principal components of the company s revenues consist primarily of net interest income recorded by matrix bank and matrix financial  loan administration fees generated by matrix financial  brokerage fees realized by united financial  loan origination fees and gains on sales of mortgage loans and mortgage servicing rights generated by matrix bank and matrix financial and trust service fees generated by sterling trust 
while uss and ucm have not generated material amounts of revenue during their limited operating history  management anticipates that they will make a larger contribution to the company s revenues in the future 
the company s results of operations are influenced by changes in interest rates and the effect of these changes on the interest spreads of the company  the volume of loan originations  mortgage loan prepayments and the value of mortgage servicing portfolios

the above were offset by a increase in average interest bearing liabilities to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december   and a decrease in the company s yield on interest earning assets to from for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in the company s yield on interest earning assets was attributable to the lower yield earned on the loan portfolio  which decreased to as compared to for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the loan portfolio yield decrease is attributable to the overall market decrease in interest rates and the acquisition of loans with less discounts by the company

servicing portfolios brokered by united financial increased billion to billion for the year ended december  as compared to billion for the year ended december  the decrease in brokerage fees is attributable to an overall decrease in the margins earned on the servicing brokered 
trust service fees 
trust service fees increased  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is associated with the growth in the number of trust accounts under administration at sterling trust  which increased to  at december  from  at december  and the increase in the total assets under administration which increased to over billion at december  from under billion at december  gain on sale of loans and mortgage backed securities

the secondary loss was attributable to the failure of a former officer of matrix financial to adhere to the company s established hedging policies  and as a result  certain closed loans were not adequately hedged 
the million loss resulted when interest rates increased dramatically in march  thereby causing the funded loans and pipeline commitments to decline in market value 
had the company s policies been followed  a loss still would have been recognized  albeit significantly smaller  since it is difficult for the company to be completely hedged when interest rates rapidly and significantly change 
the company has implemented several management and reporting changes to help ensure that the hedging policies established by matrix financial s board of directors are followed to mitigate secondary losses in volatile interest rate markets

a significant portion of the company s revenues and net income is derived from net interest income and  accordingly  the company strives to manage its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to generate what management believes to be an appropriate contribution from net interest income 
asset and liability management seeks to control the volatility of the company s performance due to changes in interest rates 
the company constantly attempts to achieve an appropriate relationship between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities 
the company has responded to interest rate volatility by developing and implementing asset and liability management strategies designed to increase its noninterest income and improve the match between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
these strategies include 
utilizing mortgage servicing rights as a source of noninterest income and as a countermeasure against the decline in the value of mortgage loans during a rising interest rate environment 
increases in interest rates tend to increase the value of mortgage servicing rights because of the resulting decrease in prepayment rates on the underlying loans  
increasing the noninterest bearing custodial escrow balances related to the company s mortgage servicing rights  
increasing focus on lines of business that are less interest rate sensitive  such as brokerage activities  consulting services  self directed trust services and real estate disposition  
maintaining a wholesale loan origination operation 
wholesale originations provide a form of hedge against the balance of mortgage loan servicing rights 
in a decreasing interest rate environment  the value of the servicing portfolio tends to decrease due to increased prepayments of the underlying loans 
during this same period  however  the volume of loan originations generally increases  
originating and purchasing adjustable rate mortgages and selling newly originated fixed rate residential mortgages in the secondary market  
increasing emphasis on the origination of construction and commercial real estate lending  which tend to have higher interest rates with shorter loan maturities than residential mortgage loans  
increasing retail deposits  which are less susceptible to changes in interest rates than other funding sources  and 
pursuing strategic acquisitions or alliances that provide fee based income or generate liabilities that are less expensive or less interest rate sensitive than retail deposits or borrowings from third party institutions to fund the company s investing activities  and 
hedging segments of the company s servicing portfolio and forward commitments on our loan pipeline 
lending activities 
the major interest earning asset of the company is the loan portfolio 
consequently  a significant part of the company s asset and liability management involves monitoring the composition of the company s loan portfolio  including the corresponding maturities 
the table below sets forth the composition of the company s loan portfolio by loan type as of the dates indicated 
the amounts in the table below are shown net of discounts and other deductions

loans held for sale are classified as maturing within one year 
actual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities shown below as a result of renewals and prepayments or the timing of loan sales 
as of december  less than one to over five one year five years years total in thousands residential    multi family  commercial real estate and commercial     construction   consumer     total loans     loans held for investment  which are contractually due in one or more years  are split between fixed and adjustable rates as follows as of december  one to five over five years years total in thousands fixed    adjustable    total loans    nonperforming assets 
as part of asset and liability management  the company monitors nonperforming assets npas on a monthly basis 
npas consist primarily of nonaccrual loans and foreclosed real estate 
loans are placed on nonaccrual when full payment of principal or interest is in doubt or when they are past due days as to either principal or interest 
foreclosed real estate arises primarily through foreclosure on mortgage loans owned 
the following table sets forth the company s npas as of the dates indicated as of december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual mortgage loans     nonaccrual consumer loans total nonperforming loans     foreclosed real estate  repossessed automobiles total nonperforming assets      total nonperforming loans to total loans total nonperforming assets to total assets ratio of allowance for loan and valuation losses to total non performing loans interest income on nonperforming loans not included in interest income as of december   the company had no non government accruing loans that were contractually past due days or more 
beginning in  however  the company began to accrue interest for government sponsored loans such as fha insured and va guaranteed loans which are past due or more days  as the interest on these loans is insured by the federal government 
the aggregate unpaid principal balance of accruing loans which were past due or more days was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the higher levels of mortgage nonaccrual loans as a percentage of total loans during and were primarily attributable to purchases by matrix bank of bulk residential loan portfolios in those years 
as part of its business strategy  matrix bank purchases loans at a discount that have had delinquencies in the past 
however  the purchase activity in and has resulted in the company acquiring lower discounted packages 
due to the past delinquency problems  there is often an increase in delinquencies after the loans are purchased as a result of the servicing being transferred to the company 
the company s experience has been that it generally takes to days after the servicing transfer to see an improvement in the delinquency statistics 
the decrease in the mortgage nonaccrual loans at december  and is attributable to the improvement of the loans that had past delinquency problems and the credit quality of the loan portfolios the company acquired in and in and  matrix bank acquired loans with fewer delinquency problems and or document deficiencies  which also resulted in a decrease in the nonaccrual loans 
the increase in the nonaccrual consumer loans in is a result of sub prime auto loans that the company repurchased pursuant to limited representations and warranties included in loan sale agreements 
the company had a separate reserve of  included in other liabilities for anticipated losses relating to the repurchased sub prime auto loans at december  included in repossessed assets for is  of automobiles that the company was required to repurchase pursuant to the same limited representations and warranties 
the balance of the loans and automobiles repurchased in and were either disposed of or sold to a third party investor in december the company does not anticipate that it will originate any additional sub prime automobile contracts 
the prior delinquency and anticipated future delinquencies are taken into consideration in the pricing of the loans acquired 
the company generally purchases such loans at discounts and  in some instances  receives recourse or credit enhancement from the seller to further reduce the company s risk of loss associated with the loans nonaccrual status 
at december   million  or  of the nonaccrual loans were loans that were residential loans purchased in bulk loan portfolios and remain classified as held for sale 
total loans held for sale at december   were million  of which million or were nonaccrual loans 
however  against the million of total loans held for sale  the company has million of purchase discounts plus an additional million of loans which have some form of recourse to the seller 
the percentage of the allowance for loan and valuation losses to nonaccrual loans varies widely due to the nature of the company s portfolio of mortgage loans  which are collateralized primarily by residential real estate 
the company analyzes the collateral for each nonperforming mortgage loan to determine potential loss exposure 
in conjunction with other factors  this loss exposure contributes to the overall assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and valuation losses 
see comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and analysis of allowance for loan and valuation losses 
the following table sets forth information regarding changes in the company s allowance for loan and valuation losses for the periods indicated

the allowance for loan and valuation losses is calculated  in part  based on historical loss experience 
in addition  management takes into consideration other factors such as certain qualitative evaluations of individual classified assets  trends in the portfolio  geographic and portfolio concentrations  new products or markets  evaluations of the changes in the historical loss experience component and projections of this component into the current and future periods based on current knowledge and conditions

risk sensitive assets and liabilities 
as discussed in asset and liability management general a significant portion of the company s earnings and ultimate success is partially dependent upon its ability to manage interest rate risk 
interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure of the company s net interest income to adverse movements in interest rates 
although the company manages other risks  such as credit  operational and liquidity risk in the normal course of business  management considers interest rate risk to be a significant market risk which could potentially have the largest material effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the majority of the company s market risk related to interest rates exists within the operations of matrix bank 
however  matrix financial also has interest rate risk related to its primary asset  mortgage servicing rights  and also related to the net interest income earned on its originated loans that are funded through warehouse lines of credit 
the susceptibility to movements in interest rates affects the cash flows generated from the msrs which are recorded in other income versus interest income 
in a decreasing interest rate environment  the underlying servicing portfolio tends to prepay faster which reduces future servicing income  while in an increasing interest rate environment  prepayments tend to decrease  which increases expected future servicing income 
as it relates to matrix financial s lending activities  matrix financial originates residential mortgage loans  which are generally pre sold 
however  between the time that the loan is originated and sold to the ultimate investor  matrix financial earns interest income 
the loans are funded through the use of warehouse credit facilities that are generally priced based on short term interest rates 
therefore  the net interest income that is earned by matrix financial is generally dependent on the spread between long term mortgage rates and short term interest rates 
the company currently does not maintain a trading portfolio 
as a result  the company is not exposed to market risk as it relates to trading activities 
the majority of the company s residential loan portfolio is held for sale which requires the company to perform quarterly market valuations of the portfolio in order to properly record the portfolio at the lower of cost or market 
therefore  the company continually monitors the interest rates of its loan portfolio as compared to prevalent interest rates in the market 
interest rate risk management at matrix bank is the responsibility of the asset and liability committee alco or the committee  which reports to the board of directors of matrix bank 
alco establishes policies that monitor and coordinate the company s sources  uses and pricing of its funds 
the committee is also involved in formulating the company s budget and strategic plan as it relates to investment objectives 
due to the historical size of matrix bank s loan portfolio and the high degree of purchase and sale activity  alco has relied on the ots interest rate risk exposure report to assist in the overall monitoring of matrix bank s interest rate sensitivity 
based on the information and assumptions used in the ots exposure report as of december   management believes that a basis point shock over a twelve month period  up or down would not significantly affect matrix bank s annualized net interest income 
the company continues to attempt to reduce the volatility in net interest income by managing the relationship of interest rate sensitive assets to interest rate sensitive liabilities 
to accomplish this see asset and liability management general for additional discussion on strategies  management focuses on acquiring adjustable rate residential mortgages and has increased its efforts regarding the origination of residential construction loans  commercial real estate loans and limited consumer lending which reprice or mature more quickly than fixed rate residential real estate loans 
the other significant asset that the company invests in is residential mortgage servicing rights 
the value and cash flows from msrs respond counter cyclically to the value of fixed rate mortgages 
when interest rates increase and the value of rate mortgages decrease in turn decreasing net interest income the value of the msrs increase 
in a decreasing interest rate environment  the inverse occurs 
another significant strategy which the company focuses on in managing interest rate risk  is identifying lines of business that generate noninterest rate sensitive liabilities 
examples of this strategy are the investment in msrs  which generate zero cost escrow deposits  and sterling trust s operations which create deposits with relatively low costs 
in the ordinary course of business  the company makes commitments to originate residential mortgage loans and holds originated loans until delivery to an investor 
inherent in this business are risks associated with changes in interest rates and the resulting change in the market value of the pipeline loans 
the company mitigates this risk through the use of mandatory and nonmandatory forward commitments to sell loans 
as of december   the company had million in pipeline and funded loans offset with mandatory forward commitments of million and nonmandatory forward commitments of million 
the inherent value of the forward commitments is considered in the determination of the lower of cost or market for such loans 
the following table represents  in tabular form  contractual balances of the company s on balance sheet financial instruments in dollars at the expected maturity dates  as well as the fair value of those on balance sheet financial instruments for the period ended december  the expected maturity categories take into consideration historical and anticipated prepayment speeds  as well as actual amortization of principal and does not take into consideration the reinvestment of cash 
the company s assets and liabilities that do not have a stated maturity date  such as interest earning deposits  fhlb stock and certain other deposits  are considered to be long term in nature by the company and are reported in the thereafter column 
the company has made the assumption that the portfolio of loans held for sale will mature in the first year 
the company is very active in the secondary market as it relates to the purchasing and selling of mortgage loans 
the total amount of loans sold in approximates the total loan portfolio balance at december   therefore  the one year maturity assumption is supported 
the company also treats the fhlb and revolving borrowings as long term in nature  as the continued availability of these amounts is anticipated indefinitely 
third party servicers service a portion of the company s loan portfolio  as a result  a portion of the information presented is based on the best available information 
the carrying amounts of interest earning deposits  fhlb stock  fhlb borrowings and borrowed money approximate those assets and liabilities fair values 
the fair values of the loan portfolios for held for sale and held for investment are based on quoted market prices or outstanding commitments from investors 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are based on quoted market prices of similar loans sold in securitization transactions  adjusted for differences in loan characteristics 
the fair value of forward sale commitments are included in the determination of the fair value of loans held for sale 
the fair values of demand deposits  are by definition equal to the amount payable upon demand at the reporting date 
the fair value of time deposits are based upon the discounted value of contractual cash flows  which is estimated using interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected periodic maturities on time deposits 
msrs  which are discussed above  are not included in the tabular presentation  as the investment does not directly affect interest income 
as noted  however  earnings from msrs directly correlate with market risk as it relates to interest rate fluctuations 
the company mitigates this risk through both the type of msrs acquired and hedging of msrs 
the loans underlying the servicing acquired tend to be more seasoned and have lower principal balances 
management believes that the more seasoned  lower balance servicing portfolios carry less prepayment risk than less seasoned  higher balance mortgage servicing  because the cost savings of refinancing a lower balance loan tend to be less than for a higher balance loan with a comparable interest rate 
it is also believed that if a loan has been outstanding for a period of time and has been through several declining interest rate cycles with no refinancing  the risk of prepayment in the future is less than a newly originated loan 
the prepayment percentages which the company has experienced over the past three years have been lower than experienced in the industry  as a whole 
the prepayment speeds for the years ended december   and were  and  respectively  during a primarily decreasing interest rate environment 
in the table below  a prepayment speed of was used to project expected cash flows relating to loans held for investment 
this assumption is based on the company s historical prepayment speeds  as well as our knowledge and experience in the market 
ownership of mortgage servicing rights exposes the company to impairment of its value in certain interest rate environments 
the incidence of prepayment of a mortgage loan increases during periods of declining interest rates as the homeowner seeks to refinance the loan to a lower interest rate 
if the level of prepayment on segments of the company s mortgage servicing portfolio achieves a level higher than projected by the company for an extended period of time  then an impairment in the associated basis in the mortgage servicing rights may occur 
to mitigate this risk of impairment due to declining interest rates  the company hedged a segment of its portfolio beginning in september as of december   the company had identified and hedged million of its mortgage servicing portfolio using a program of exchange traded futures and options 
at december   the company had the following open positions open positions fair value by expiration date contracts notional amount contract ten year treasury note features march   ten year treasury note put options february  ten year treasury note call options february   during  the company closed a portion of its hedge positions which resulted in a realized gain of approximately  being recognized in connection with the sale of a portion of the hedged servicing portfolio 
at december   the net realized and the unrealized deferred gain of the open positions was approximately  expected maturity date fiscal year ended december  there fair after total value dollars in thousands interest earning assets held for sale fixed rate residential loans    average interest rate adjustable rate residential loans

for the fixed rate loans held for investment  the company computed a weighted average interest rate and a weighted average maturity for the loan portfolio and then applied a prepayment assumption of in determining the cash flows 
the same approach was used for the adjustable rate loans which are generally fully indexed loans 
the adjustable rate loans generally are indexed to the year treasury 
however  included in the balance are loans indexed to th district cost of funds  prime and  and year treasury

short term borrowings 
a primary function of asset and liability management is to ensure adequate liquidity 
in addition to cash and cash equivalents  the company relies heavily on short term borrowing capabilities for liquidity and as a funding vehicle 
the primary sources for short term borrowing are the fhlb for matrix bank and unaffiliated financial institutions for matrix financial 
see liquidity and capital resources

to date  matrix capital s principal source of funding for its investing activities has been secured senior debt provided by unaffiliated financial institutions  the issuance of senior notes in september  the issuance of senior subordinated notes in august  a bank stock loan and the company s initial public offering 
as of december   matrix capital had million in indebtedness outstanding 
the borrowed funds have been used historically as capital injections to matrix bank and matrix financial  as well as to acquire the office building in phoenix where matrix financial maintains its headquarters 
see properties 
in march  the company refinanced its bank stock loan and increased the credit available under the loan by an additional million 
the new bank stock loan has two components  a million term loan  which was used to refinance the bank stock loan in place at december   and a revolving line of credit of million 
as of december   the balance of the revolving line of credit was zero 
in may of  the balance of the revolving line of credit will be converted to a term loan 
the additional proceeds from the loan will be used as capital at matrix bank 
the new bank stock loan requires the company to maintain i total shareholders equity of million plus of all future equity contributions  plus of cumulative quarterly net income ii dividends less than of the company s net cash income after adjustments and iii total adjusted debt to stockholders equity less than in addition  the bank stock loan restricts the ability of matrix capital to pay dividends 
matrix capital may not pay dividends except for dividends payable solely in capital stock and  if no default exists or would be created by the dividend  dividends that do not exceed of matrix capital s net cash income after taxes 
as of december   these covenants would have allowed matrix capital to pay approximately million in dividends  although it has no intention to do so 
on september   the company completed a registered debt offering of million in senior notes due  raising net proceeds of approximately million 
interest on the senior notes of is payable semi annually on march and september of each year  commencing on march   with a balloon payment for the entire principal balance due in september the proceeds from the offering were used initially to reduce the company s revolving line of credit balances 
at the time investment opportunities become available  the revolving credit lines will once again be drawn upon to fund such opportunities 
the senior notes require the company to i maintain consolidated tangible equity capital of not less than million and ii meet the requirements necessary such that matrix bank will not be classified as other than well capitalized as defined by cfr section cfr additionally  the senior notes contain other covenants regarding certain restricted payments  incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of preferred stock  liens  merger  consolidation or sale of assets and transactions with affiliates 
under the conditions of the senior notes  the company may not incur any additional indebtedness if the consolidated leverage ratio exceeds and neither matrix capital nor any subsidiary may declare or pay dividends other than a dividends or other payments or distributions payable in equity interests of matrix capital or b dividends or other payments or distributions payable to matrix capital or any wholly owned subsidiary of matrix capital that is a restricted subsidiary under the terms of the indenture unless  at the time and after giving effect to such dividend  no default shall have occurred and be contrary under the indenture 
matrix capital after giving effect to the payment of such dividend would be permitted to incur at least of additional indebtedness pursuant to the consolidated leverage ratio described above  and such dividend  together with the aggregate amount of all restricted payments made  is less than of the aggregate consolidated net income of the company for the period beginning on october  and ending on the date of the company s most recent quarter and for which consolidated financial statements are available plus of the net cash proceeds received by matrix capital from the issuance of equity interests 
as of december   under the foregoing test  matrix capital would be entitled to declare and pay dividends of approximately  although it has no present intent to do so 
in august  the company issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes 
interest on the senior subordinated notes is payable semi annually on january and july  and the senior subordinated notes mature on july   with earlier mandatory redemptions of  or of the senior subordinated notes  scheduled on july    and  respectively 
the company is restricted from paying cash dividends under the senior subordinated notes 
however  the company may pay cash dividends in an amount equal to of the consolidated net income of the company as long as there has been no default under the terms of the senior subordinated notes and as long as the dividend does not exceed of the consolidated net worth of the company 
the company may redeem the senior subordinated notes  in whole or in part  at any time on or after july   at a redemption price equal to i of par through july  and  thereafter  at par  plus ii all accrued but unpaid interest 
until february  the senior subordinated notes bore interest at per annum 
in february  the rate increased to per annum 
the trend experienced over the reported periods of cash used by the company s operating activities results primarily from the growth that matrix financial has experienced in its investment in mortgage servicing rights and the growth that matrix bank has experienced in its whole loan purchasing activity 
the company anticipates the trend of a net use of cash from operations to continue for the foreseeable future 
this anticipation results from the expected growth at matrix bank  which management believes will consist primarily of increased activity in the purchasing of loan portfolios 
the company anticipates such growth will be funded through retail deposits  brokered deposits  custodial escrow deposits  directed trust deposits and fhlb borrowings 
the company s principal source of funding for its servicing acquisition activities consists of line of credit facilities provided to matrix financial by unaffiliated financial institutions 
in prior years  matrix financial relied on various sources for funding its servicing acquisition activities  including servicing acquisition lines  the sale of mortgage servicing rights that were accounted for as financings and capital contributions from the company 
as of december   matrix financial s servicing acquisition facilities aggregated million  of which million was available to be utilized after deducting drawn amounts 
borrowings under the servicing acquisition lines of credit are secured by mortgage servicing rights owned by matrix financial  bear interest at the federal funds rate plus a negotiated margin and are due at the earlier of the maturity of the mortgage servicing rights or amortized over five to six years from the date of borrowing 
at december   million was outstanding under the servicing acquisition line and the interest rate on funds outstanding under this facility at december was

as of december   matrix financial s sale repurchase facilities aggregated million  with no balance outstanding 
borrowings under the sale repurchase facilities are secured by all of the mortgage loans funded with sale repurchase facility proceeds and bear interest at either the prime rate or the libor rate plus a negotiated margin depending on the facility 
the company s principal source of funding for the working capital needs of matrix financial consists of working capital facilities provided to matrix financial by unaffiliated financial institutions

on january   the company renegotiated its revolving credit facilities for warehouse lending  servicing acquisitions and working capital 
with this renegotiation  the aggregate amount of warehouse lines of credit facilities was increased to million  the aggregate amount of the servicing acquisition facility was increased to million  and the aggregate amount of the working capital facility was increased to million 
the million working capital facility became a separate component to the revolving credit facilities  and is no longer a sub limit to the warehouse line of credit 
the new credit facility agreement requires matrix financial to maintain i total shareholders equity of at least million plus of capital contributed after january   plus of cumulative quarterly net income  ii adjusted net worth  as defined  of at least million  iii a servicing portfolio of at least billion and iv principal debt of term line borrowings of no more than the lesser of of the appraised value of the mortgage servicing portfolio or of the unpaid principal balance of the mortgage servicing portfolio

the availability of the overline facility is at the lender s sole discretion 
matrix bank s primary sources of funds for use in lending  purchasing bulk loan portfolios  investing and other general purposes are retail deposits  custodial escrow balances  fhlb borrowings  sales of loan portfolios and proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans 
to the extent that funding sources are not sufficient to fund matrix bank s growth  brokered deposits will be utilized 
contractual loan payments and deposit inflows and outflows are a generally predictable source of funds  while loan prepayments and loan sales are significantly influenced by general market interest rates and economic conditions 
borrowings on a short term basis are used as a cash management vehicle to compensate for seasonal or other reductions in normal sources of funds 
matrix bank utilizes advances from the fhlb as its primary source for borrowings 
at december   matrix bank had overnight borrowings from the fhlb of million 
the custodial escrow balances held by matrix bank fluctuate based upon the mix and size of the related mortgage servicing rights portfolios 
for a tabular presentation of the company s short term borrowings  see short term borrowings 
matrix bank offers a variety of deposit accounts having a range of interest rates and terms 
matrix bank s deposits principally consist of demand deposits and certificates of deposit 
the flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions  changes in prevailing interest rates and competition 
matrix bank s retail deposits are obtained primarily from areas in which it is located and  therefore  its retail deposits are concentrated primarily in las cruces and sun city 
matrix bank relies principally on customer service  marketing programs and its relationships with customers to attract and retain these deposits 
matrix bank historically has not accepted brokered deposits 
however  in  it is anticipated that brokered deposits will be utilized to support the projected growth at matrix bank 
in pricing deposit rates  management considers profitability  the matching of term lengths with assets  the attractiveness to customers and rates offered by competitors 
matrix bank intends to continue its efforts to attract deposits as a primary source of funds to support its lending and investing activities 
in january  matrix bank opened a retail branch in sun city  arizona 
the company has been successful in attracting deposits at the sun city location and this success has been the primary reason for the increased deposit growth that the company has experienced for the year ended december  in october  matrix bank opened a second retail branch in las cruces 
in february  sterling trust moved approximately million of deposits under administration from a third party institution to matrix bank

matrix bank s future growth is expected to be achieved through deposit growth  borrowings from the fhlb and custodial deposits from affiliates 
the company anticipates that such growth will require additional capital 
the capital requirements related to the anticipated growth will in part be fulfilled through retention of earnings  increasing the company s bank stock loan and the use of a portion of the proceeds raised from the issuance of senior notes  which was completed in september see regulation and supervision matrix bank s capital ratios

year in the next two years  most companies will face a potentially serious information systems computer problem because many software applications and operational programs written in the past may not properly recognize calendar dates beginning in the year this problem could force computers to either shut down or provide incorrect data or information 
the company has begun the process of identifying the changes required to its computer programs and hardware  in consultation with software and hardware providers and regulators 
as of march   the company has completed an inventory of all of its systems and applications 
based on this inventory  ninety five critical systems have been identified within the company and its subsidiaries 
the company s deadline for full system hardware and software compliance for the year issue is january  the company has established a year plan  which will be implemented in stages to address critical systems and applications first  and includes replacement of any systems that cannot be brought into compliance by the stated deadline 
additionally  the company has formed a combined year team spearheaded by the company s chief information officer to ensure that consistent methodologies are being used by the subsidiaries to address the various year issues 
the company s computing environment consists largely of personal computers connected to local area network lan based systems 
the exception to this is an in house digital vax mini computer system used by sterling trust 
this vax system houses the trust accounting system which is written in the cobol language 
based on the company s year plan  this system is scheduled to be in compliance by the january  deadline 
the company s plan involves modification and or replacement of systems as necessary to allow them to function properly with respect to date in the year and thereafter 
management presently believes that the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if the required modifications or replacements are not made  or are not completed in a timely manner  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company has identified different vendors and suppliers currently utilized by the company and its subsidiaries 
letters requesting the status of the identified vendors year compliance have been sent to approximately of these vendors 
the remaining vendors will be contacted by the end of april the company and its subsidiaries receive information from many outside sources 
as such  the company will be working closely with those vendors to minimize its exposure to non compliant sources of data 
vendors that cannot meet the january  deadline for compliance will be reviewed by the project team to evaluate the company s need to replace the affected system and or the vendor in exchange for an alternative provider 
processing for many of the matrix bank and matrix financial systems are handled by outside service bureaus 
these service bureaus have already been contacted by the company and are either already in compliance  or are expected to be in compliance by the company s deadline 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company relies will be converted timely and will not have an adverse effect on the company or its systems 
the costs for compliance or replacement have been determined for approximately of the company s systems 
the total impact for the remaining systems will be determined during the next quarter 
the current costs identified approximate  the company anticipates that total costs associated with year compliance will not exceed  as such  year compliance is not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations 
most of the costs associated with the year issue will be expensed as incurred  however  any costs attributable to the purchase of new software will be capitalized 
the costs of the project and the deadline by which the company believes that it will be year compliant are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events 
there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated
