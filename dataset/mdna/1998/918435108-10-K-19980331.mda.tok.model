as of december   the company has expended approximately million and the remaining amounts are expected to be expended over the next eighteen months 
a substantial portion of the costs associated with the replacement of existing systems will be recorded as assets and amortized over their useful lives 
in addition  the company has conducted a review to identify the systems that could be affected by the year issue 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the companys programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could cause the companys computer systems to perform inaccurate calculations 
the company has developed a timeline for enhancing its computer systems 
the enhancement  together with other planned system changes  are intended to correct the year issue 
the company does not expect the amounts required to be expensed over the next two years  to correct the year issue  to have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
the company has also initiated discussions with its significant suppliers and large customers to ensure that those parties have appropriate plans to remediate year issues where their systems interface with the companys systems or otherwise impact its operations 
the company expects that estimated working capital requirements and estimated capital expenditures will be funded by cash from operations and availability under the credit facility 
certain information in this report contains forward looking statements as such term is defined in section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act 
certain factors such as competitive pressures  customer and product mix  system conversion and year issues  regulatory changes  and capital markets could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward looking statements
