results of operations overview micro linear corporation was founded in from its formation through  the company focused initially on application specific integrated circuits for particular customers and  subsequently  on application specific standard products  principally for the hard disk drive hdd industry 
commencing in  the company implemented a fundamental change in its business strategy to expand the markets and applications for its products and to lessen its dependence on the hdd industry 
as a result of its diversification efforts  the company substantially reduced its dependence on the hdd industry and hdd product sales accounted for less than of net revenues for micro linear currently serves the communications  industrial and computer markets with a broad range of standard products for a variety of applications  including local area networks  mass storage  video  telecommunications  power management  battery management  motor control and data conversion 
the company utilizes three principal manufacturing process technologies  bipolar  cmos and bicmos  and has released approximately new products over the last three years 
since the second half of  sales of communication products have constituted a substantial majority of the company s revenues 
specifically  such products represented approximately  and of net revenues for   and  respectively 
the communications market is characterized by intense competition  relatively short product life cycles and rapid technological change 
in addition  the communications market has undergone rapid growth and consolidation in the last few years 
the company s net revenues and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected in the event of a slowdown in this market segment 
the company is attempting to reduce its dependency on the communications industry through various means  such as expanding its product mix and customer base 
the company s operating results are subject to quarterly and other fluctuations which may result from the timing and extent of process development costs  changes in the mix of products sold  the timing and extent of research and development expenses  the availability and cost of wafers from outside foundries  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  and competitive pricing pressures 
other factors which may result in operating fluctuations are the company s ability to access advanced process technologies  the ability to introduce new products on a timely basis  market acceptance of the company s and its customers products  the timing of new product announcements and cyclical semiconductor industry conditions 
moreover  the company s business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules  and customer orders typically can be canceled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer 
as a result of the foregoing or other factors  the company expects to continue to experience material fluctuations in its future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis 
annual results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations interest income expense  net income before provision for taxes provision for taxes on income net income net revenues net revenues were million for  million for and million for net revenues in increased over net revenues in and net revenues decreased over the company serves three principal market segments  computer  communications and industrial 
net revenues for compared to increased in the communications market  in the industrial market and decreased in the computer market 
net revenues for compared to increased in the communications market and decreased in the industrial market and in the computer market 
the company expects to report for its first fiscal quarter ending march  a decline in net revenues of approximately to from the million of revenue recorded in the quarter ended december  the anticipated revenue decline is the result of softness in business demand which has resulted in lower than expected turns orders thus negatively impacting overall revenue levels for the first quarter 
the company also expects first quarter earnings to be below the per share reported in the fourth quarter of the communications market includes the computer networking equipment networking sub market 
sales of products to the networking market constitutes a substantial majority of the company s net revenues 
revenues in the networking sub market for were million  or of net revenues  compared to million  or of net revenues  for and million  or of net revenues  for networking net revenues in absolute terms increased in compared to and compared to due primarily to new product introductions  new customers and overall market growth in the networking segment 
the networking sub market is characterized by intense competition  relatively short product life cycles and rapid technological change 
in addition  the networking sub market has undergone a period of rapid growth  price erosion and consolidation in recent years 
although the company has expanded its product mix and customer base  the company expects its dependency on sales to network equipment manufacturers to continue for the immediate future 
the company s business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant slowdown in the computer networking equipment market 
international revenues for totaled million  or of net revenues  compared to million  or of net revenues  for and million  or of net revenues  for the increase in international revenues in compared to and was due to stronger demand for the company s products in asia and europe 
international revenues in exclude shipments to amtron 
a significant portion of amtron s purchases were sold to samsung electronics and other korean customers 
there were no samsung sales to amtron in and  compared to of net revenues in through the end of  the company had not experienced any negative impact as a result of the financial and stock market dislocations that occurred in the asian financial markets 
domestic distributor revenues were approximately of total net revenues for each of  and the company expects sales to domestic distributors to increase in the future as a percentage of total net revenues due to anticipated shifts in the sales channel mix 
in this regard  several of the company s oem original equipment manufacturer customers have moved their manufacturing operations to subcontractors and in turn are placing their orders through distributors 
the company defers recognition of revenue derived from sales to domestic distributors until such distributors resell the products to their customers 
revenue is recognized by the company upon shipment to international representatives  but the gross margin on these shipments is deferred until international distributors notify the company of product sales to end users 
gross margin the company s gross margin is affected by the volume of product sales  price  product mix  manufacturing utilization  product yields and the mix of sales to oem s and to distributors 
gross margin has been and will continue to be periodically affected by expenses incurred in connection with start up and installation of new process technologies at outside manufacturing foundries 
the company s gross margin declined to in from in  primarily due to lower average selling prices related to competitive pricing pressures  especially in the communications market which represents a substantial majority of the company s net revenues 
gross margins increased to in from in  primarily due to lower per unit manufacturing costs as a result of higher manufacturing utilization  and a shift in product mix to higher margin products 
the company s gross margin is adversely impacted by the costs associated with installing new processes at its foundries 
although the company has recently been able to mitigate the adverse impact on gross margin associated with new wafer manufacturing process costs by relying upon process technologies existing at its outside wafer foundries  there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to incur significant expenses in the future to develop  or obtain access to  advanced process technologies and to transfer and install such technologies at one or more of its foundries  which could have a material adverse effect on gross margin in the future 
the company currently purchases its wafers from six wafer suppliers 
a substantial majority of the company s wafer supply is obtained from three wafer suppliers 
the company s products are assembled and packaged by four vendors 
any delays or interruptions due to such factors as inadequate capacity or unavailable raw materials in the company s wafer suppliers or assembly vendors could materially and adversely affect product shipments 
the company purchases nearly all of its bicmos wafers from two wafer foundries  the majority of which are supplied by one wafer foundry in taiwan 
although both wafer foundries are qualified to supply the company with bicmos wafers  the company s short term bicmos wafer supply could be materially and adversely affected if the wafer foundry in taiwan is unable to meet the company s wafer supply requirements 
approximately one third of the company s bipolar wafers are purchased from a wafer foundry in japan and have pricing contracts that are tied to currency fluctuations of the yen 
wafer pricing for this foundry is adjusted every months  either up or down  depending on the movement of the yen 
the company does not expect to be significantly impacted by this pricing agreement and as a result does not enter into foreign currency hedging arrangements 
however  due to the uncertainty of the currency markets and the recent fluctuations of the yen versus the us dollar  there can be no assurance that significant swings in currency will not have a material adverse effect on gross margin in the future due to the impact of such fluctuations on this contract or other contracts the company has with foundries in japan 
research and development expenses research and development expenses include costs associated with the definition  design and development of standard and semi standard products  tile arrays and standard cells 
in addition  research and development expenses include test development and prototype assembly costs associated with new product development 
the company also expenses prototype wafers and new production mask sets related to new products as research and development costs until products based on new designs are fully characterized by the company and are demonstrated to support published data sheets and satisfy reliability tests 
the company believes that the development and introduction of new products is critical to its future success 
research and development expenses such as mask and silicon costs that are related to the development of new products can fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to the timing of the product design process 
research and development expenses were million for  or of net revenues  compared to million  or of net revenues  in and million  or of net revenues  in the increase in research and development in absolute dollars in compared to is primarily attributable to the addition of personnel associated with the company s new design center in cambridge  england 
the increase in research and development in absolute dollars in compared to is primarily attributable to higher prototype product costs associated with new product development 
the company expects to add additional design engineers in cambridge throughout the remainder of the company believes that the development and introduction of new products is critical to its future success and expects that research and development expenses will increase in the future in absolute dollars 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were million for  or of net revenues  compared to million  or of net revenues  in and million  or of net revenues  in the increase in absolute dollars in compared to is primarily attributable to higher staffing levels  an increase in sales commissions due to higher net revenues  increased business conference costs  and increased professional fees 
the increase in absolute dollars in compared to is primarily attributable to an increase in staffing levels  increased travel costs and legal fees associated with a litigation matter 
the company expects additional spending increases in absolute dollars in selling  general and administrative expenses in the future 
interest and other income and interest expense interest and other income was million for  million for and million for the decrease in over and over were due to lower average cash balances and lower interest rates 
interest income is affected by changes in the company s cash balance as well as prevailing interest rates 
interest expense was million for each of and and million for provision for income taxes the company s effective tax rates for and were compared to for the higher effective tax rate in compared to was due principally to the full utilization of all remaining federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in fiscal the effective tax rates for and differ from the statutory income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes  net of federal research credits 
the effective tax rate for differs from the statutory income tax rate primarily as a result of utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and adjustments of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources since  the company has financed its operations and capital requirements principally through cash flow from operations and the proceeds from its initial public offering in october operations provided million of net cash during  an increase of million over the increase in cash from operations is primarily attributable to decreased inventory levels and deferred tax assets and higher accounts payable partially offset by higher accounts receivable balances at the end of cash used in investing activities for is attributable to capital expenditures of million and the net purchase of short term investments of million 
the company currently expects capital expenditures to be approximately million in and as of december  had capital commitments for of approximately 
million 
financing activities for consist primarily of the repurchase of the company s common stock for million 
from january through the end of  the board of directors approved the repurchase of an aggregate of million of the company s common stock in stock repurchase programs 
through december   the company has repurchased  shares at an aggregate cost of million through the end of subsequent to year end  the company had repurchased a total of  shares of its common stock for million as of february  and the board of directors approved an additional million in january to be used for the stock repurchase program 
the company also generated million of proceeds from common stock issued under employee stock option and purchase plans 
working capital amounted to million as of december  and includes cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million 
the company s liquidity is affected by many factors  including  among others  the extent to which the company pursues additional wafer fabrication capacity from existing foundry suppliers or new suppliers  capital expenditures  and the level of the company s product development efforts  and other factors related to the uncertainties of the industry and global economies 
although the company s cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors  the company anticipates that its existing cash resources and cash generated from operations will fund necessary purchases of capital equipment and provide adequate working capital for at least the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurance that events in the future will not require the company to seek additional capital sooner or  if so required  that such capital will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
other factors affecting future operating results the company s quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially and adversely affect revenues and profitability  including the company s access to advanced process technologies  the timing and extent of process development costs  the company s ability to introduce new products on a timely basis  the volume and timing of orders received  market acceptance of the company s and its customers products  the timing of new product announcements and introductions by the company or its competitors  changes in the mix of products sold  the timing and extent of research and development expenses  the availability and cost of wafers from outside foundries  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  fluctuations in the relative exchange rate of the yen and the us dollar  competitive pricing pressures and cyclical semiconductor industry conditions 
a majority of the company s net revenues are derived from sales of a limited number of products 
historically  average selling prices in the semiconductor industry have decreased over the life of any particular product 
competitive pricing pressures are expected to continue in the future  especially in the communications market  and may have a material adverse effect on the company s gross margin 
the company s business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules  and customer orders typically can be canceled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer 
due to the absence of substantial noncancellable backlog  the company typically plans its production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
in addition  the company is limited in its ability to reduce costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
as a result of the foregoing or other factors  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which would materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the markets for the company s products are characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product introductions 
to remain competitive  the company must develop or obtain access to advanced semiconductor process technologies in order to reduce die size  increase die performance and functional complexity  and improve yields 
semiconductor design and process methodologies are subject to rapid technological change  requiring large expenditures for research and development 
if the company is unable to develop or obtain access to advanced wafer processing technologies as they become needed  or is unable to define  design  develop and introduce competitive new products on a timely basis  its future operating results will be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  if the company is unable to transfer and install such new process technologies to one or more of its foundries in a timely manner  its business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
a substantial portion of the company s net revenues are derived from sales of products for computer networking applications 
sales of the company s products to network equipment manufacturers accounted for approximately of the company s net revenues in and accounted for of the company s top selling products for these products constituted approximately of the company s revenues for the same period 
the computer networking equipment market is characterized by intense competition relatively short product life cycles and rapid technological change 
in addition  the computer network equipment market has undergone a period of rapid growth and experienced consolidation among the competitors in the market place in recent years 
although the company has expanded its product mix and customer base  the company expects its dependency on sales to network equipment manufacturers to continue into the company s business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant slowdown in the computer networking equipment market 
in addition  as a result of competitive pricing pressures  the company has experienced lower margins in certain of its existing and recently introduced products for computer networking applications 
there can be no assurance as to when or if such pricing pressure will lessen 
such pricing pressures will have an adverse affect on the company s results of operations unless they can be offset by higher margins on other products or reduced operating expenses 
the company s market diversification and product development activities have placed  and could continue to place  a significant strain on the company s limited personnel and other resources 
the company s ability to manage any future growth effectively will require it to integrate its new employees into its overall operations  to continue to improve its operational  financial and management systems and to attract  train  motivate and manage its employees successfully 
if the company s management is unable to manage growth effectively  the company s business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change  cyclical market patterns  significant price erosion  periods of over capacity and production shortages  variations in manufacturing costs and yields and significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development 
the industry has from time to time experienced depressed business conditions 
the company may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future operating results due to general semiconductor industry conditions or other factors 
in june  the fasb issued statement no 
fas reporting comprehensive income 
fas establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements 
comprehensive income as defined includes all changes in equity net assets during a period from nonowner sources 
an example of an item to be included in comprehensive income which is excluded in net income would be unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities 
the company currently estimates that the impact of adopting sfas will be insignificant 
the disclosures prescribed by fas are effective for fiscal also in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas establishes standards for the way companies report information about operating segments in annual financial statements 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
the company currently believes that it operates in one segment as defined by sfas and therefore believes that the impact of sfas on the company s financial statement disclosures will be insignificant 
the disclosures prescribed by sfas are effective for fiscal year the year issue arises because most computer systems and programs were designed to handle only a two digit year  not a four digit year 
when the year begins  these computers may interpret as the year and could either stop processing date related computations or could process them incorrectly 
the company has commenced  for all of its information systems  a year date conversion project to address all necessary code changes  testing and implementation and accordingly does not anticipate any internal year issues from its own information systems  databases or programs 
the company could be adversely impacted by year issues faced by major distributors  suppliers  customers  vendors and financial service organizations with which the company interacts 
the company is in the process of developing a plan to determine the impact that third parties who are not year compliant may have on the operations of the company 
at this time  the year compliance expense and related potential effect of the company s earnings are estimated to be insignificant 
as of march  the company has not identified any loss contingencies related to the year issues for products it has sold
