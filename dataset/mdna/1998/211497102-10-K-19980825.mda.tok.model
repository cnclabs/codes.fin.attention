continental information systems corporation and its subsidiaries year as the year approaches  a critical issue has emerged for all companies  including the company  with respect to whether application software programs and operating systems utilized by a company and the companies with which it does business can accommodate this date value 
in brief  many existing application software products in the marketplace were designed only to accommodate a two digit date position which represents the year eg  is stored on the system and represents the year 
as a result  the year ie  could be the maximum date value these systems will be able to process accurately 
the company has  for several months  been engaged in a review of the software and information systems it uses in an effort to determine whether it or its operations may be materially adversely affected by this so called year conversion 
as a result of that review  the company upgraded and replaced its hardware systems with systems that are year compliant 
in addition  the company has engaged a vendor to provide new lease billing software and has identified another vendor to replace its accounting software 
the company expects that this software will be installed by the middle of the company has inquired of  and generally obtained the assurances of  the providers of such software with respect to its being year compliant 
based on its review the company does not presently believe that year compliance issues with respect to its software and systems will cause any material disruptions  malfunctions or failures of its business 
however  no assurances can be given that such review uncovered every potential adverse effect of the year conversion in connection with any of such software or systems 
with respect to assets other than its computer hardware and software systems  the company is aware that some of the equipment it leases may have embedded technology that is not year compliant 
under the terms of the leases  however  the company is not responsible for the maintenance and repair of this equipment  and the leases are non cancelable 
failure to achieve year compliance may materially adversely affect the residual value of such equipment 
no assurance can be given that such decrease in residual value would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business or results of operations 
the company has only recently begun a review of whether the software and systems of the vendors  financing sources  customers  equipment manufacturers or distributors or other parties with which it deals may  as a result of the year conversion  have a materially adverse effect on the company or its operations 
accordingly  it is too early for the company to be able to predict whether such software and systems of such parties may have such effect 
as part of this review  the company will attempt to obtain assurances from each of such parties  whose dealings with the company are material to the company or its operations  that such party does not and will not utilize software or systems that may interfere with the company  or are or will be important to the operations of such party  that may cause problems to such party or the company as a result of the year conversion 
however  no assurances can be given that the company will be able to obtain the information from such parties necessary for the company to determine whether it may be materially adversely affected by the software or systems of such parties 
continental information systems corporation and its subsidiaries the company currently believes that its systems will be year compliant during and therefore has not developed a contingency plan 
nevertheless  the company will maintain an ongoing effort to recognize and evaluate potential exposure relating to the year conversion arising from its use of software supplied by other parties or its dealings with other parties 
the total cost to the company of these year compliance activities has not been  and is not anticipated to be  material to its financial position or results of operations in any given year
