item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this review contains management s discussion of the company s operational results and financial condition and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements 
overview medimmune commenced operations in april and  through  revenue was generated solely from research and development agreements and research grants 
in  contract revenues rose substantially and the company began selling its first product  cytogam  to an exclusive distributor 
in december  the company reacquired the cytogam marketing rights from its distributor and launched an expanded marketing program for this product through its own sales force 
on january   the company s second product  respigam  was licensed for marketing by the us food and drug administration fda for the prevention of serious lower respiratory tract infection caused by rsv in children under months of age with bpd or a history of prematurity 
because of the seasonal nature of rsv  limited sales  if any  are expected during the second and third quarters  causing results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
results of operations compared to product sales increased for the year ended december   over the year ended december   due to increased demand for respigam in the first half of the product s second full season of sales  as well as a increase in cytogam sales 
respigam sales were million in versus million in  a increase  reflecting an increase in vials sold 
supply constraints limited and sales 
cytogam product sales increased to million from million in due primarily to a increase in units sold  and two price increases that took effect in mid and mid in cytogam product sales were reduced by a million reserve for trade receivables due from a pharmaceutical wholesaler that filed chapter bankruptcy in august  million was recovered against this loss in as a result of a sale of the receivables to a third party 
although the company markets directly to hospitals and physicians  the company sells its products through a limited number of pharmaceutical wholesalers 
a similar event with another wholesaler could adversely affect operating income 
the level of future product sales will be dependent on several factors  including  but not limited to  the timing and extent of future regulatory approvals of the company s products and product candidates  availability of finished product inventory  approval and commercialization of competitive products and the degree of acceptance of the company s products in the marketplace 
the company submitted a biologic license application to the fda in december requesting marketing clearance for its second generation rsv product  synagis 
marketing clearance has not yet been obtained and there can be no assurance that such approval will be obtained 
the company believes that if synagis were licensed for marketing  it would significantly adversely affect sales of respigam 
other revenues increased to million in from million in other revenues in reflect primarily fees paid by abbott laboratories for the right to market and distribute the company s second generation rsv drug  synagis  outside the us the company is also entitled to receive an additional million from abbott upon receipt of a marketing approval in the us and other major markets 
sales of synagis are dependent upon marketing clearance from the fda and other regulatory authorities and there can be no assurance that such clearance will be obtained 
other revenues in reflect the completion of milestone and research funding payments under the company s strategic alliance with ahp  formerly american cyanamid company 
under the terms of the alliance  the company and ahp share in the profits or losses of respigam  reimbursements or payments under this arrangement are deducted from or added to operating expenses and are included in selling  administrative and general expenses 
subsequent to december   the company received million from smithkline beecham pursuant to an agreement signed in december to develop and commercialize human papillomavirus vaccines for prevention of cervical cancer and genital warts 
this payment will be included in other revenues along with research funding that will be due the company under the terms of the alliance 
the level of contract revenues in future periods will depend primarily upon the extent to which the company enters into other collaborative contractual arrangements  if any 
cost of sales increased to million in from million in  due to a increase in vials sold 
gross margins in improved to versus in  reflecting the increased sales of respigam in the product mix  which has a lower royalty rate than cytogam 
margins were adversely impacted by a charge for an estimate of additional royalties due to massachusetts health research institute as part of a possible settlement of an ongoing inquiry by the inspector general of the commonwealth of massachusetts 
see note of notes to financial statements 
if settled as presently contemplated  the increased royalty rate would continue to apply to future sales of respigam 
the company s products are manufactured by third parties and future per unit cost of sales could increase if the company is unable to negotiate favorable pricing 
the company has substantially completed construction of its own manufacturing facility intended for some portion of the production of its two approved products as well as other product candidates  including synagis 
this facility is subject to inspection and approval by the fda and any resulting sales of product from this facility would not commence for at least the next months 
if synagis is licensed for marketing by the fda  the company may book a reserve against respigam inventory 
the magnitude of this reserve  if any  would be determined by factors including  but not limited to  the timing of synagis approval  the extent of respigam inventory on hand at the time  the assessed market potential of synagis and the assessed market potential of respigam 
additionally  if synagis is licensed for marketing by the fda  its margin may differ significantly from those of the company s existing products  however  because synagis has never been produced in commercial quantities  the impact  if any  on margins is not known 
research  development and clinical costs of million were incurred in compared to million in  an increase of 
expenditures in and include approximately million and million  respectively  for the clinical studies performed for synagis  including a  patient phase clinical trial that began in the fourth quarter of and was substantially completed by the end of the second quarter 
expenses also include million in license fees relating to synagis and medi  a monoclonal antibody that inhibits t cell responses 
the level of the company s total research and development expenses in future periods will fluctuate depending on the extent of clinical trial spending 
the company expects clinical trial expenses to be significantly lower in than selling  administrative and general expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in reflects primarily ahp s share of respigam s profits  which resulted in a charge of million to selling expenses as calculated under the terms of the strategic alliance 
this compared to million in reimbursement from ahp in for its share of respigam product line loss  as calculated under the terms of the strategic alliance 
other selling and marketing expenses increased by million  reflecting increased commission and product distribution costs resulting from the increased product sales 
this was offset by a million decrease in sales detailing costs to ahp as a result of the company s decision to not use ahp s sales force to detail respigam in the rsv season 
general and administrative expenses increased by million reflecting increased headcount  legal and other costs 
selling  administrative and general expenses are expected to increase in as the company prepares for the potential market launch of synagis  if and when licensed by the fda 
expenses in include million of other operating expenses  which include the costs of start up of the frederick manufacturing facility and scale up of production of synagis at the gaithersburg pilot plant and at a third party manufacturer  boehringer ingelheim pharma kg bi in biberach  germany 
the company expects to incur significant start up and scale up costs throughout and into interest income decreased to million in compared to million in the decrease reflects lower cash balances available for investment  partially offset by an increase in interest rates that increased the overall portfolio yield 
interest expense increased to million in from million in  reflecting primarily interest on the convertible subordinated notes of the company issued in july net of amounts capitalized and interest on equipment financing  primarily in the second half of interest expense in and is net of and million  respectively  of interest capitalized against the manufacturing facility and the pilot plant expansion 
the net loss of million  or basic and diluted per common share  compared to a net loss of million  or basic and diluted per common share 
shares used in computing basic and diluted loss per share were million and million  respectively  in and the company does not believe that inflation had a material effect on its financial statements 
these results were consistent with the company s objectives for the year and with the continued development of its immunotherapeutic and vaccine products 
the factors that affected results may continue to affect near term future financial results
