item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following is a discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the company for the years ended december   and the information contained in the following discussion reflects the results of the fuel systems business of dyno industrier a 
s dyno or walbro europe subsequent to its acquisition on july  year ended december  compared to  compared to sales the company reported sales in of million  an increase of from million 
the sales increase was generated by additional sales to the automotive market in north and south america and additional sales to the small engine market partially offset by lower sales to the europe automotive market due to lower foreign currency exchange rates 
sales in were million compared to sales of million in  an increase of mostly because of the dyno acquisition 
on a percentage basis  sales to the automotive market increased in compared to a increase in sales to the small engine market increased in compared to a increase in aftermarket sales increased in compared to flat sales in compared to sales of the company s original equipment automotive products were million in compared to million in and million in the increase in automotive product sales resulted from increased sales of plastic fuel tank systems to both north american and south american oem customers partially offset by lower sales of steel fuel rails in the us and lower plastic fuel tank sales to european oem customers 
the entire european sales decline was due to foreign currency exchange rates which were off compared to the us dollar causing a million decrease in sales 
the increased sales of plastic fuel tank systems resulted from the launch of four new programs in the us during and one new program launched in late in brazil 
the sales growth was lower in due to i insourcing of fuel pumps and fuel modules by one of the company s largest customers which was completed during the first half of  ii lower shipments to chrysler in the second quarter because of a strike at chrysler s mound road engine plant  and iii lower production of passenger cars in the us in addition  sales were lower due to the delay of one new plastic tank program and the cancellation of another new plastic tank program by a customer who decided to delay the conversion from a steel to plastic fuel tank 
in  all of the automotive product sales increase was generated by sales in europe  as us based automotive product sales declined by 
the increase was primarily the result of including a full year of walbro europe sales in  million  versus including only five months of walbro europe sales in of million 
us based automotive product sales were lower in because of insourcing of fuel pumps and fuel modules by one of the company s largest customers 
the decline in us based automotive product sales was substantially offset by increased sales of fuel modules to the company s largest customer and sales of the company s new plastic fuel rails 
sales of the company s small engine products were million in  up from million in and million in during  ignition system sales had the largest increase of followed by float feed carburetor sales in the people s republic of china prc with a increase 
diaphragm carburetor sales increased and float feed carburetor sales in the us increased by 
most of the diaphragm carburetor sales increase was in japan which increased by in spite of a decline in the yen dollar exchange rate 
the increase in prc sales was less than expected because sales suffered in the second half of from a significant reduction in orders as customers were forced to reduce excess motorcycle inventories 
in  much of the increase in small engine product sales came from increased sales of ignition systems up million or and to a lesser extent float feed carburetors in the us up million or and float feed carburetors in the prc up million or 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in diaphragm carburetors of million or due to reduced demand for handheld power equipment caused by drought in the southeast and southwest us and cold  wet spring conditions in other parts of the us sales declined in japan because of lower demand and the lower yen dollar exchange rate 
sales of small engine ignition systems were million in compared to million in and million in as customer demand has grown for this expanding family of products 
management believes that ignition systems will play a more significant role in the future as small engines become subject to more stringent emissions regulations 
in  the california air resources board promulgated comprehensive air quality regulations limiting small engine emissions  which became effective in august a more stringent phase is scheduled to become effective in in addition  the environmental protection agency epa has imposed similar regulations which became effective in august  with a more stringent phase expected to become effective during the to period 
the more stringent regulations could significantly reduce the number of units currently sold  especially diaphragm carburetors  as these regulations could force manufacturers to replace low cost gasoline powered lawn and garden equipment with electric powered equipment 
in response to the more stringent regulations  the company is integrating its carburetor and ignition technology to develop an engine management system which will electronically control both fuel delivery and ignition functions to limit exhaust emissions 
the company has successfully refined existing carburetors to meet the first set of standards and company engineers are developing new technology to meet the subsequent requirements 
the company s aftermarket business includes both automotive and small engine products 
aftermarket sales were million in compared to million in and million in the increase in sales was due to adding new customers during the year and the addition of several new products offered to aftermarket customers 
aftermarket sales declined slightly in because of increased in house production by one of the company s larger aftermarket customers 
cost of sales cost of sales was million in compared to million in and million in cost of sales as a percent of sales was in compared to in and in and consequently gross margin was in compared to in and in gross margin declined in because of lower margins in both automotive and small engine products 
the lower automotive gross margin was due to a change in the mix of products sold in the us  the launch costs of four new multi layer plastic fuel tank programs  start up costs for new plants in argentina and south korea  relocation of two plants in europe  and increased warranty costs 
the change in mix of products sold involved lower steel fuel rail volume  lower volume of fuel pumps and fuel modules from customer insourcing  the chrysler mound road facility strike  and lower production of us passenger cars 
at the same time  volume increased for new plastic fuel tank systems which carry lower gross margins because they include a high level of purchased components 
increased warranty costs in included million for four product warranty issues 
the warranty issues included a steel fuel rail  two plastic fuel tanks in europe and an ignition module for the small engine market 
management believes that the technical issues have been resolved and does not expect additional charges related to these warranty claims 
the lower gross margin in for small engine products was related primarily to lower volume in the two facilities in the prc  the warranty cost for an ignition module previously discussed and one time costs of moving two plants 
the mexico carburetor plant and the mexico ignition system plant were relocated to a new larger facility in mexico that supports both operations with lower overhead costs 
gross margin declined in because of lower margins in both automotive and small engine products 
lower margins in automotive products resulted from lower volumes at all of the north american facilities  new plant start up costs in brazil and from an increased share of european plastic fuel tank volume which carry lower margins than the company s other automotive products 
during  walbro europe gross margins were compared to in and were lower primarily because of the new plant start up costs in belgium  lower volume at the united kingdom plant and the norway plant 
lower margins in small engine products resulted primarily from lower volumes of diaphragm carburetors  the new plant start up costs in tianjin  prc and the weaker yen dollar exchange rate 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative s a expenses were million in  an increase of compared to million in the increase in s a was due to new plants in south korea and the prc and due to higher professional fees 
the increased professional fees included financing fees for modifications to bank loan agreements  legal fees  settlement of legal claims and other one time charges 
in  s a expenses increased by without europe compared to million in the full year of walbro europe s a expenses in compared to only five months in caused a large portion of the increase and the remainder of the s a increase came primarily from new plants in brazil  the prc and the new tucson precision products plant 
as a percent of sales  s a expenses were in  in and in research and development expenses research and development r d expenses were million in  a decrease of compared to million in in  r d resources to support small engine product development were increased because of emission regulations but overall expenses declined because automotive r d resources were used to support many new production launches of plastic fuel tank programs and their expenses were charged to cost of sales 
in  walbro europe r d expenses accounted for all of the increase as r d expenses excluding europe decreased by 
restructuring and impairment charges during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a million pretax charge for restructuring its operations and other actions 
the charge was comprised of a million charge for restructuring and a million charge associated with asset impairments 
the restructuring actions include divestiture of the company s ligonier  indiana steel fuel rail manufacturing facility and disposition of its interest in us coexcell inc  a manufacturer of blow molded plastic drums in maumee  ohio 
in addition  the company will consolidate its small engine operations in the asia pacific region and restructure its european automotive fuel tank operations 
the asset impairment charge included the write off of obsolete equipment and tooling  write off of its interest in saginaw plastics  an injection molder in saginaw  michigan and charges related to its korean automotive activities 
lastly  the restructuring charge included a corporate wide headcount reduction of approximately percent including reductions related to the divestitures and restructuring 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
loss on foreign exchange transactions the company entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the company s foreign currency exposure related to a sales commitment to a foreign customer 
the loss on these contracts was treated as a hedge for accounting purposes and recorded as a deferred asset  which was amortized as foreign currency exchange loss in and the foreign currency exchange result was a million loss in compared to a small gain in and see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
net interest expense net interest expense was million in compared to million in and million in to finance the dyno acquisition in july  the company sold million in aggregate principal amount of its senior notes and obtained a new million secured credit facility 
in december  the company sold million of its senior notes and used the proceeds to repay a significant part of the secured credit facility 
borrowing levels were higher in both and to support capital expenditures for facility expansions and for additional equipment and tooling 
the additional borrowings and the shift to a higher percentage of long term fixed rate debt raised the average cost of capital and caused the higher interest expense 
the average cost of borrowing was in  in and in see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details of the borrowings 
income taxes the provision for income taxes was a credit of million in compared to expense of million in and million in the provision was a credit because of negative taxable income related to the restructuring charge and other actions with an effective tax rate of 
the provision was higher in compared to because of a lower research and development r d tax credit recorded in of million compared to million recorded in these r d tax credits resulted from a change by the internal revenue service in defining the r d activities which qualify for the tax credit 
the million credit in and lower taxable income caused the lower provision for income taxes in the r d tax credits resulted in an effective tax rate of for compared to for joint venture income the company s equity in income of joint ventures was million in compared to million in and million in the decrease in resulted from lower income at marwal systems france due to payment of royalties to the company  start up costs for marwal argentina and losses at korea automotive fuel systems 
the increase in compared to resulted from increased income at marwal systems partially offset by losses at korea automotive fuel systems 
minority interest minority interest was million in compared to million in and million in the increase was due to the sale of million of convertible preferred securities of walbro capital trust in february the preferred dividends are included as minority interest 
net income loss and income loss per share net loss for was million compared to net income of million in and million in net loss per share was for compared with net income per share of for and for the net loss for was the result of the reasons stated above including the restructuring charge and warranty reserve 
inflation inflation potentially affects the company in two principal ways 
first  a portion of the company s debt is tied to prevailing short term interest rates which may change as a result of inflation rates  translating into changes in interest expense 
second  general inflation can impact material purchases  labor and other costs 
in many cases  the company has limited ability to pass through inflation related cost increases due to the competitive nature of the markets that the company serves 
in the past three years  however  inflation has not been a significant factor for the company 
foreign currency transactions approximately of the company s sales during were derived from international manufacturing operations in europe  asia  south america and mexico 
the financial position and the results of operations of the company s subsidiaries in europe of sales  japan and south korea of sales  south america of sales and prc of sales are measured in local currency of the countries in which they operate and translated into us dollars 
the effects of foreign currency fluctuations in europe  japan  prc  south america and south korea are somewhat mitigated by the fact that expenses are generally incurred in the same currencies in which sales are generated and the reported income of these subsidiaries will be higher or lower depending on a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar 
for the company s subsidiaries in singapore and mexico of sales the expenses are generally incurred in the local currency  but sales are generated in us dollars  therefore  results of operations are more directly influenced by a weakening or strengthening of the local currency versus the us dollar 
approximately of the company s net assets at december   are based in its foreign operations and are translated into us dollars at foreign currency exchange rates in effect as of the end of each period 
accordingly  the company s consolidated shareholders equity will fluctuate depending upon the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar 
in addition  the company has equity investments in unconsolidated joint ventures in argentina  brazil  france  japan  korea and mexico 
the company s reported income from these joint ventures will be higher or lower depending upon a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar 
the company s strategy for management of currency risk relies primarily upon the use of forward currency exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations related to its operations in foreign countries and to manage its firm transaction commitments in foreign currencies 
the year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs that were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in miscalculations or system failures 
the company is working to resolve the potential impact of the year on the processing of date sensitive information and is in the process of conducting an evaluation of the impact of the issue at all locations 
the evaluation includes computer programs used for management information systems and computer programs used to electronically control manufacturing equipment and other devices 
the evaluation has not progressed enough to allow management to assess whether the cost of addressing this issue will have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows in future periods 
management expects this evaluation to be completed during liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had million outstanding in short term debt  including current portion of long term debt  and million in long term debt 
the approximate minimum principal payments required on the company s long term debt in each of the five fiscal years subsequent to december  are million in  million in  million in  million in  million in and million thereafter 
in february  the company completed an offering of  shares or million of convertible preferred securities of walbro capital trust and the proceeds were used to pay down borrowings on the million secured bank credit facility the credit facility 
in december  the company issued million of its senior notes due and the proceeds were used to pay down borrowings on the credit facility 
with the issuance of the senior notes the amount currently available under the credit facility was reduced to million 
at february   the company had approximately million of funds available to it under the credit facility 
in april  the company received a commitment for a million line of credit the new credit facility consisting of a million revolving line of credit and a million capital expenditure facility 
the new credit facility will be available for five years after closing 
proceeds of the new credit facility will be used to pay off million under the credit facility  the purchase money loan agreement  and the notes described below including an early retirement premium of approximately million  to finance capital expenditures  and to meet working capital needs 
closing of the new credit facility is subject to customary conditions and is expected to occur by may  failure to close the new credit facility would have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the company is a party to an intercreditor agreement the intercreditor agreement dated as of july  and executed by and among the company  the holders the noteholders of the senior notes due october  the notes and the banks which are a party to the credit facility the banks 
the company and the banks and the noteholders disagree with the interpretation of certain provisions of the intercreditor agreement 
as a result  the company has agreed to use its best efforts to retire the notes by no later the may  and the noteholders have agreed that  until may   they will forbear from taking any action under the notes 
the company will use the new credit facility to provide the financing to retire the notes 
as of december   accounts receivable amounted to million  an increase of million  compared to million at december  the average collection period at december  was days compared to days at december  the increase in accounts receivable was due to higher sales  larger amounts of accounts receivable for customer tooling and the addition of foreign customers with longer payment terms 
the company s plans for capital expenditures for facilities  equipment and tooling total approximately million 
the capital expenditure plan includes new processing equipment and tooling 
the company intends to finance the capital expenditures with borrowings under the new credit facility  potential lease financing  access to capital markets and cash from operations 
management believes that the company s long term cash needs will continue to be provided principally by operating activities supplemented  to the extent required  by borrowing under the company s existing and future credit facilities and by access to the capital markets 
management expects to replace these credit facilities as they expire with comparable facilities
