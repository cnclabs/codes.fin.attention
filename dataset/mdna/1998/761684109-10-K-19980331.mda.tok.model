during  the company s board of directors adopted a formal plan of restructuring whereby the company implemented a plan to cease production operations at its elkhart  indiana manufacturing plant and potentially sell all or part of the real estate the facility occupied 
this decision was based upon the company s evaluation of costs and the product quality of the recreational vehicles being produced in elkhart 
concurrent with this decision  the company recently completed an expansion of its lancaster facility to accommodate the expected rise in production 
two key transactions adversely impacted the company s results of operations during in addition to the aforementioned restructuring charge for the production closure of the elkhart facility  the company reached a settlement of an existing class action lawsuit against the company 
pursuant to the settlement  the company is required to pay  plus issue coupons to all members of the class for a discount of on future repairs or  towards the purchase of a new rexhall vehicle

in implementing these plans  the company decided to cease manufacturing operations at its elkhart  indiana plant 
the closure of this facility was done in conjunction with the recently completed expansion of its lancaster  california facility to accommodate the anticipated increased production 
the company believes that the national market can be adequately served from the california facility and that any slight increase in freight charges will be more than offset by the reduced manufacturing costs
