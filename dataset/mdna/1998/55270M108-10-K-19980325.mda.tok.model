the amount of the credit facility that existed in available to the company could not exceed the lesser of million or an amount equal to the sum of i of the net book value of all eligible receivables less than days old  except that all receivables from any particular customer would be ineligible if more than of the total due from such customers are aged days or more plus ii an amount equal to the lesser of either of the then value of all inventory  not to exceed of the aggregate unpaid principal balance less the amount secured by inventory acquired by the company from hewlett packard and not yet paid for  or if advances were made against foreign accounts receivables  not to exceed million the borrowing base 
the borrowing base could be changed by the bank  in its sole discretion  from time to time

interest on the credit facility was payable in arrears on the last day of each month and at maturity  except that interest on loans bearing interest utilizing the libor option was payable on the last day of the contract period and at maturity  unless the contract period was longer than days in which case interest was payable every three months 
the company s ability to utilize the libor option was subject to certain conditions set forth in the credit facility  including the condition that the libor option must have adequately compensated the bank for making such loan 
if the interest option selected by the company was deemed ineffective by the bank  the company would be required to pay the bank interest at the prime rate until an effective libor election was made

under the terms of the credit facility  the company paid the bank a quarterly commitment fee of of the daily difference between million and the aggregate unpaid principal outstanding balance under the credit facility 
the principal amount of the credit facility could be prepaid without premium or penalty unless the amount prepaid was subject to the libor option  in which event the company would be obligated to pay the bank accrued interest  if any  and a premium based on the principal amount paid and computed for the period from the date of the last day of the contract period for the amount subject to the libor option at a rate equal to the excess  if any  of the libor rate over the bond equivalent yield for us treasury debt securities for a term similar to the contract period 
moreover  if  in the bank s opinion  any event had occurred which increased the cost of funding or maintaining the libor option or reduced the amount of any payment to be made to the bank in respect thereof  the company would be obligated to pay the bank an amount equal to such cost increase or reduced payment  as the case may be  and the company must also pay to the bank any amount which reduced the bank s rate of return and required the bank to increase its capital 
the indebtedness under the credit facility was secured by substantially all of the assets of the company  including accounts receivable  equipment and inventory 
in addition  the credit facility required that the company maintain a tangible net worth of million and thereafter increasing by an amount equal to of the company s net income annually thereafter  maintain a debt to tangible net worth ratio of and annual pre tax interest coverage net income plus interest expense plus income tax of or more of the company s annual interest expense 
the company was  at december   in compliance with these financial covenants 
events of default under the credit facility include  among other things  the failure to pay interest and or principal when due  the failure of the representations or warranties of the company to be true and correct  the failure or repudiation of the performance of the credit facility by the company  any default of the company and other indebtedness where such creditor had the right to accelerate the maturity of such indebtedness  the entry of any judgment against the company  the failure of the company to provide information to the bank  the use of the proceeds of the credit facility for any purpose not in the ordinary course of the company s business or the occurrence of any event which  in the bank s judgment  was likely to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition  properties or business operations of the company  or if the bank believed that the prospect of payment or the performance of any obligation evidenced by the credit facility was impaired 
the occurrence of an event of default would have given the bank the right to immediately terminate the credit facility and declare any indebtedness outstanding thereunder immediately due and payable 
the credit facility further stated that it would be an event of default if the company  without first providing to the bank prior written notice i used advances under the credit facility to acquire less than a majority interest in any company or venture  ii became a party to any merger or consolidation  purchased all of the assets or business of any corporation or business enterprise  created or acquired any subsidiary or made any investment in any stock or other equity securities of any kind  or iii became a party to any joint venture or partnership  sold or transferred any equity interest in any subsidiary  or issued any equity interest 
moreover  the company could not  except in connection with certain acquisition transactions  without the bank s prior consent  make loans or advances to others or borrowings under the credit facility  or become a guarantor of any kind

these covenants include  among other restrictions i the maintenance of certain financial ratios  ii restrictions on a the purchase or sale of assets  b any merger  sale or consolidation activity  c loans  investments and guaranties made by the company  d lease and sale and leaseback transactions  and e capital expenditures  and iii certain limitations on the incurrence of other indebtedness 
these provisions may constrain the company s acquisition strategy  or may delay  deter  or prevent a takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in its best interests and may have an adverse effect on the market price of the company s common stock 
in addition  the credit facility prohibits the payment of dividends and certain repurchases of the common stock 
inflation certain of the company s product offerings  particularly paper products  have been and are expected to continue to be subject to significant price fluctuations due to inflationary and other market conditions 
the company is generally able to pass such increased costs on to its customers through price increases  although the company may not be able to adjust its prices immediately 
in general  the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its results of operations in recent years 
technological advances have caused its prices on certain products to decrease  which could have a negative impact on margins 
inventory management the company manages its inventory by maintaining sufficient quantities of the most frequently ordered products to achieve high order fill rates while at the same time attempting to maximize inventory turns 
the company does not maintain any inventory of certain items  which items  when ordered from the company are drop shipped ie  shipped from the manufacturer s loading dock directly to the company s customers 
while the company sells more than  stock keeping units skus or items of merchandise  approximately skus account for approximately of the company revenues 
consequently  the company is continually attempting to identify slow moving inventory by use of its computer software applications and deletes those skus whenever possible in order to maximize inventory turns 
inventory balances will fluctuate as the company adds new product lines  when it makes large purchases from suppliers to take advantage of attractive terms and when certain inventory items are deleted 
inventory turns on an annual basis remained consistent at times for the years ended december  and year the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the millennium approaches 
the year problem is pervasive and complex as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to the issue is whether computer systems will properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
the company is utilizing internal resources to identify and correct  or reprogram  the system for year compliance 
the company s as hardware and operating system are already compliant 
the company is in the process of selecting and installing new software in response to the company s expansion and acquisition program which is year compliant 
the installation is expected to be completed in and is expected to cost approximately million
