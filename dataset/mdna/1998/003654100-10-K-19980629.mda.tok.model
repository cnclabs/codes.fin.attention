item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data  and the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
the discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth under risk factors below 
overview the company is a leader in the research and development of cardiac assist and heart replacement technology 
the company developed  manufactures and sells the bvs  a temporary cardiac assist device  and is developing a totally implantable  battery powered  heart replacement device 
the company s operating results reflect the dual activities of commercial operations and investments in the research and development of new technologies 
the bvs is a temporary cardiac assist device designed to provide a patient s failing heart with full circulatory assistance while allowing the heart to rest  heal and recover its function 
the bvs is the only device that can provide full circulatory assistance approved by the fda as a bridge to recovery device for the treatment of all patients with reversible heart failure 
since fiscal  the first full year of marketing the bvs in the united states  increasing reorders and new orders of the bvs have made product revenues the largest contributor to the company s revenues 
the company has focused its initial selling efforts of the bvs on the approximately medical centers that perform the most heart surgery procedures  teaching centers and transplant centers 
as of march   the bvs had been purchased by over medical centers in the united states  many of which are within the group of medical centers initially targeted 
the bvs consists of a pneumatic drive and control console  single use external blood pumps and cannulae 
during fiscal  revenues from bvs sales represented all of the company s product revenues with no single customer representing more than of product revenues 
research and development is a significant portion of the company s operations 
the company s research and development efforts are focused on the development of new products  primarily related to cardiac assist and heart replacement  and the continued enhancement of the bvs and related technologies 
the company s research and development expenses have been primarily attributable to research and development under the company s government contracts and grants 
revenues from contract research and development and total research and development costs have increased in each of the past three years 
the company s government sponsored research and development contracts generally provide for payment on a cost plus fixed fee basis 
the company accounts for revenue under these contracts and grants as work is performed  provided that the government has appropriated sufficient funds for the work 
there can be no assurance that the government will not terminate  reduce or delay the funding for any of the company s contracts 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining any new government contracts or further extensions to existing contracts 
in fiscal  the company began using its own resources to fund the further development of the hrd in amounts significantly in excess of the funding provided under the company s hrd contract 
the company estimates that the development of the hrd  including conducting pre clinical and clinical studies and obtaining regulatory approvals  will require substantial funds 
in fiscal  the company incurred million  or per share  of discretionary spending for this project in excess of the amount appropriated under the company s hrd contract 
excluding these expenses  the company s income from continuing operations for fiscal would have been million or per share 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop the hrd  or receive the required regulatory approvals to commence clinical trials on a timely basis or within budget  if at all 
in fiscal  the company made the decision to shift all of its focus to the company s core cardiovascular business and to sell  license or otherwise dispose of its dental business 
the company s consolidated financial results contain certain accounts that have been reclassified in each of the periods presented to reflect this decision by the company 
the operating losses of the company s dental business are presented on a net basis in the consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations and  for the year ended march   include a one time charge of  representing the estimated loss on the disposal of the business  its assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated as a percentage of total revenues year ended march  revenues products contracts total revenues costs and expenses cost of product revenues research and development selling  general and administrative total costs and expenses income loss from operations interest and other income  net income loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations net income loss revenues 
total revenues  excluding interest income  increased to million in fiscal from million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
this represents increases of and for fiscal and respectively 
these increases were attributable to an increase in both product and contract revenues 
product revenues increased to million in fiscal from million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the and increases in product revenue in fiscal and  respectively  were primarily attributable to growing united states unit sales of bvs single use products  including increased blood pump reorders  growing united states unit sales of bvs consoles and to increased average selling prices of the bvs single use products and bvs consoles 
the majority of the company s product revenue in the last three years has been to united states customers 
international revenues represented  and of total product revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
contract revenues increased to million in fiscal from million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the and increases in contract revenue in fiscal and primarily reflected increased activity under the company s hrd contract 
the company accounts for revenue under its government contracts and grants as work is performed  provided that the government has appropriated sufficient funds for the work 
through march   the government had appropriated million of the million phase ii hrd contract amount 
during fiscal  the company s expenditures under the hrd contract exceeded the appropriated amount 
as a result  in fiscal  the company recognized as revenue all of the remaining million balance of the million appropriated under the hrd contract and used million of its own resources to fund hrd development 
the original government appropriation schedule calls for million to be appropriated for the hrd contract in both october and this schedule is subject to change at the discretion of the government 
the company plans to further increase its expenditures in connection with the development of the hrd  and it will not recognize any further contract revenues under the hrd contract until such time as additional funds are appropriated under the hrd contract  if ever 
the company believes that certain of its costs incurred prior to further appropriations may be reimbursable under the hrd contract  if and when additional appropriation under the hrd contract is made 
due to the company s accelerated hrd development activity and the timing of government appropriations  the company believes that it will experience significant quarterly fluctuations in contract revenues 
the company also believes that its total expenses to complete the development of the hrd will significantly exceed the remaining million hrd contract amount 
as of march   the company s total backlog of research and development contracts and grants was million including million under the hrd contract and million for heart booster research and development 
funding for the company s government research and development contracts is subject to government appropriation  and all of these contracts contain provisions which make them terminable at the convenience of the government 
cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues represented approximately  and of product revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
the changes in gross margins as a percent of product revenues are primarily attributable to the mix of product sold with a higher proportion of revenues derived from bvs blood pumps in fiscal and compared to fiscal the higher fiscal cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues also included costs related to the company s voluntary recall in fiscal of certain production lots of disposable bvs blood pumps 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for fiscal increased to million compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively  representing increases of and for and  respectively 
these increases primarily reflected a higher level of development activity related to the hrd 
the company anticipates that its research and development expenses will continue to increase as a result of its plans to further increase its research and development efforts to further develop and test the hrd and enhance the bvs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased to million compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively  representing increases of approximately and for and  respectively 
the increases primarily reflect increased sales expenses  particularly increased personnel and sales commissions  related to the increase in product revenues  as well as additional administrative personnel and legal expenses 
interest and other income 
interest and other income consist primarily of interest earned on the company s short term investments 
interest income increased to million in fiscal compared to million in both fiscal and  representing an increase of 
this increase primarily reflects the company s higher average investment balances 
discontinued operations 
discontinued operations consist of the net revenues  costs and expenses of the company s dental subsidiary  abiodent 
in fiscal  the company made the decision to shift all of its focus to the company s core cardiovascular business and to sell  license or otherwise dispose of its dental business 
the million loss from discontinued operations for the year ended march  represents a loss from dental operation of  or per share  and an estimated loss on the disposal of the business  its assets and extinguishment of liabilities of  or per share  which includes an estimated operating loss from dental activities of  to be incurred during the first six months of fiscal liquidity and capital resources as of march   the company had million in cash and short term marketable securities 
the company also has a  line of credit from a bank that expires in september  and which was entirely available at march during fiscal  operating activities used  of cash 
net cash used by operating activities in fiscal reflected a net loss of million  including depreciation and amortization expense of  an increase in accounts receivable of approximately  an increase in inventory of approximately  and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of approximately  these uses of cash were partially offset by the establishment of a reserve for net assets and liabilities of discontinued operations of approximately million  an increase in accounts payable of approximately  and an increase in accrued expenses of approximately million 
the increase in accounts receivable is attributable to increased revenues and extended collection periods for certain accounts 
the increase in inventory reflects increased production levels 
the increase in accounts payable is primarily attributed to increased purchases and timing of purchases of direct material and capital equipment for manufacturing  research and development 
the increase in accrued expenses reflects timing of payments and increased operating activity throughout the company  including increased size of payroll and payroll related costs 
during fiscal  investing activities used million of cash 
net cash used by investing activities included million of purchases of short term investments and million of purchases and improvements of property and equipment 
although the company does not currently have significant capital commitments  the company believes that it will continue to make significant investments over the next several years to support the development and commercialization of its products and the expansion of its manufacturing facility 
the company is currently negotiating with its landlord to enter into a new or amended lease which would allow the company to consolidate its operations into one building by expanding into approximately  square feet of additional space in one of the two buildings occupied by the company and exiting approximately  square feet of space in the second building 
the company intends to use the additional space primarily to expand its manufacturing and research and development activities 
the company anticipates beginning to use this new space within the next twelve months 
the company has not yet finalized the details of its plans for this space and estimates that within the next twelve months it may incur costs of between two and three million dollars to improve the new and existing spaces 
during fiscal  financing activities provided million of cash 
net cash provided by financing activities included million in net proceeds from the private placement of common stock to genzyme corporation and certain of the company s directors in july  million in net proceeds from the sale of the company s common stock in november and  in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 
the company believes that its revenues and existing resources will be sufficient to fund its planned operations  including the planned increases in its internally funded hrd and new bvs development and product extension efforts  for at least the next twelve months 
however  the company estimates that it will require significant additional funds in order to complete the development and achieve regulatory approvals of the hrd and other products under development over the next several years 
see risk factors future capital needs and uncertainty of additional funding 
risk factors this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of the company s plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
the cautionary statements made in this report should be read as being applicable to all forward looking statements wherever they appear in this report 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below  as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report 
dependence on bvs product line  early stage of bvs market development in the fiscal year ended march   sales of the bvs product line  including related services  represented all of the company s product revenues 
the company believes that its dependence on the bvs product line is likely to continue for at least the next several years  unless and until the company successfully develops  obtains regulatory approvals for and sells new products 
the company has initially focused its marketing efforts on larger medical centers and hospitals 
the commercial success of the bvs will be dependent upon both the company s ability to sell the bvs to smaller hospitals and medical centers  which generally have more limited financial resources  and to increase the use of the bvs at those medical centers and hospitals which have purchased the systems 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in marketing the bvs 
advances in medical technology  biotechnology and pharmaceuticals may reduce the size of the potential markets for the company s products or render those products obsolete 
failure of the company to expand the market for and use of the bvs would have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
uncertainty of product development and clinical trials the company has developed and markets a limited number of products and believes that its future success will in large part be dependent upon its ability to develop and market innovative new products  such as the hrd 
the successful development of these products presents enormous challenges 
the company must demonstrate that the hrd  which is being designed to assume the full pumping function of both the left and right ventricles of the heart  can operate effectively and reliably within a patient over an extended period 
for many years  the company and others have been attempting to develop products that meet these criteria and have not yet been successful 
before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any of its products under development  the company must demonstrate through pre clinical studies and clinical trials that the product is safe and effective 
initial pre clinical testing of the hrd and other products being developed by the company will be conducted in simulated environments and animal models to demonstrate safety and effectiveness over an extended period of time before they are permitted to be clinically tested in humans 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully complete pre clinical testing of the hrd or other products being developed by the company and receive fda approval to initiate clinical trials of such products in a timely manner  if at all 
moreover  pre clinical trials may not be predictive of results that will be obtained in clinical trials 
any significant delays in  or termination of  pre clinical trials of the company s products under development would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
clinical trials for the company s cardiac assist and heart replacement products will be conducted with patients who are critically ill 
during the course of treatment  these patients may die or suffer other adverse medical effects for reasons that may not be related to the product being tested but which can nevertheless affect clinical trial results 
a number of companies in the medical device industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after promising results in earlier trials 
clinical trials of the company s hrd and other products under development may be delayed or terminated as a result of many factors  and there can be no assurance that such delays or terminations will not occur 
one such factor is the rate of enrollment of patients  which generally varies throughout the course of a clinical trial and which depends on the size of the potential patient population  the number of clinical trial sites  the proximity of the patients to clinical trial sites  the eligibility criteria for the trial and the existence of competitive clinical trials 
the company cannot control the rate at which patients present themselves for enrollment  and there can be no assurance that the rate of patient enrollment will be consistent with the company s expectations or be sufficient to enable clinical trials of the company s products under development to be completed in a timely manner  if at all 
any significant delays in  or termination of  clinical trials of the company s products under development would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the company s product development will be subject to numerous other risks associated with new product development  including unanticipated delays  expenses  technical problems or other difficulties that could result in the abandonment or substantial change in the design  development and commercialization of these new products 
given the uncertainties inherent with product development and introduction  there can be no assurance that any of the company s products under development will demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals  on a timely basis and within budget  if at all  or that any of these products will be commercially successful if such approvals are obtained 
anticipated future losses the company is using its own resources to fund the further development of the hrd in amounts significantly in excess of the funding provided under the company s development contract for the hrd with the nhlbi hrd contract 
the company estimates that the development of the hrd  including conducting pre clinical and clinical studies and obtaining regulatory approvals  will require substantial funds 
its spending under the hrd contract in the fiscal year ended march  exceeded by approximately million the amount which the government has appropriated for that contract  and the original government appropriation schedule calls for no further appropriations for the hrd contract until october there can be no assurance that the government will appropriate any additional amounts under the hrd contract or any of the company s other government contracts on a timely basis  if at all 
even if and when additional amounts are appropriated under the hrd contract  the company believes that its total expenses to complete the development of the hrd will significantly exceed the remaining hrd contract amount 
as a result  the company believes that it is likely that the company will incur losses from continuing operations 
the amount and duration of these losses will depend upon a number of factors  including the company s ability to increase sales and profitability of its present products  to develop and obtain regulatory approvals for new products and product enhancements  and to successfully manufacture and market these new products and enhancements  as well as the timing and extent of the company s spending related to product development and the timing of government appropriations related to the company s nhlbi contracts 
complex manufacturing  high quality requirements the nature of the company s products requires high quality manufacturing 
the company s manufacturing and quality testing processes and procedures are highly dependent on the diligence and experience of the company s personnel 
to the extent that the company s manufacturing volumes expand or the company begins the manufacture of new products  this dependence on personnel will likely increase 
in addition  the manufacture of the blood contacting surfaces of the company s products requires a high degree of precision 
these surfaces are manufactured from polyurethane based materials 
the quality and composition of polyurethane based products can vary significantly based on numerous factors including humidity  temperature  material content and air flow during the manufacturing process 
the company s products also incorporate plastic components for non blood contacting surfaces 
the company relies on third party vendors to provide these components to the company s specifications 
the company is not able to fully inspect the quality of all vendor supplied components and  therefore  relies on its vendors with respect to the quality of these components 
once the plastic based components of the company s products have been assembled  accessibility for inspection is limited 
if a defect is detected in as few as one of the company s products  or in one component of a company product  it can result in the recall or restriction on sale of products 
once assembled  in most cases  the company s blood contacting components cannot be reworked for human use 
the manufacturing lead times for parts and assemblies  particularly the polyurethane based components  can take many weeks from the date that all materials and components are received by the company 
in addition  vendor lead times for materials and components of the company s products vary significantly  with lead times for certain materials and components exceeding six months 
the company is planning to expand its manufacturing facility for the bvs during the next twelve months 
there can be no assurance that the products manufactured in the expanded facility will be manufactured at the same cost and quality as the bvs is currently being manufactured 
in addition  to the extent that the company s products under development have been manufactured  they have been manufactured as prototypes with  at most  pilot scale production 
the company s products under development are likely to involve additional manufacturing complexities and high quality requirements 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase production of the bvs or manufacture future products  if developed and approved  in commercial quantities on a consistent and timely basis  with acceptable cost and quality 
the inability to manufacture current and future products in sufficient quantities in a timely manner  and with acceptable cost and quality  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risk of market withdrawal or product recall complex medical devices  such as the bvs and other of the company s products under development  can experience performance problems that require review and possible corrective action by the manufacturer 
similar to many other medical device manufacturers  the company periodically receives reports from users of its products relating to performance difficulties that they have encountered 
the company expects that it will continue to receive customer reports regarding the performance and use of the bvs 
there can be no assurance that component failures  manufacturing errors or design defects that could result in an unsafe condition or injury to the patient will not occur 
certain of these failures or defects have been deemed sufficiently serious by the company to result in recalls of products associated with certain manufacturing lots or containing certain components 
any product problems could result in market withdrawals or recalls of products  voluntarily or required  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that a product recall will result in the recovery of all defective products or prevent customers from using these products 
the use of a defective product could result in injury to a patient and significant liability to the company  which could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
fluctuations and unpredictability of operating results the company s annual and quarterly operating results have fluctuated and the company expects these fluctuations to continue 
significant annual and quarterly fluctuations in the company s results of operations may be caused by  among other factors  the overall state of health care and cost containment efforts  economic conditions in the company s markets  the expense and timing of the company s development efforts for a particular product or product enhancement  the timing of regulatory actions  the potential need to recall or rework products from time to time  timing of government appropriations related to the company s research contracts and grants  the timing of or changes in third party reimbursement policies for the company s products  the timing of expenditures in anticipation of future sales  variations in the company s product mix and component costs  the availability of components  the timing of customer orders  adjustments of delivery schedules to accommodate customers  inventory levels of products at customers including inventory at distributors  changes in the government s funding policies under the company s existing contracts  pricing and other competitive conditions  and the timing of the announcement  introduction and delivery of new products and product enhancements by the company and its competitors 
customers may also cancel or reschedule shipments  and production difficulties could delay shipments 
the price for the bvs console is significantly higher than for the single use blood pumps 
as a result  variations in the number and timing of consoles sold have a disproportionate effect on the company s revenues and results of operations 
the company also believes that bvs sales may be somewhat seasonal  with reduced sales in the summer months  reflecting hospital personnel and physician vacation schedules 
in fiscal  the company anticipates potentially significant annual and quarterly fluctuations in contract revenues and research and development costs due to the timing of additional government appropriations under the hrd contract and to increased levels of company spending 
markets for products under development unproven most of the company s products under development  including the hrd  are targeting new and unproven markets 
there can be no assurance that the hrd or other products under development by the company will gain any degree of market acceptance among physicians  medical centers and third party payers  including managed care organizations  even if necessary regulatory approvals and reimbursement are obtained 
as a result  it is likely that the company s evaluation of the potential markets for these products will materially vary with time 
in addition  the effective use of these products will likely require development of new surgical techniques by well trained physicians  which will initially limit the market for the company s products 
physicians  patients and society as a whole may have ethical concerns or be reluctant to accept medical devices designed to replace the heart 
the timing and amount of reimbursement  if any  by third party payers for the use of these products  if developed  will also have a significant impact on the market for these products 
other companies may also introduce products or technologies that will compete with these products  reduce the market for these products  or render these products obsolete 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to market successfully any of its products under development  if and when these products are developed 
failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on key personnel  risks associated with growing number of employees the company is highly dependent on the principal members of its scientific  sales  and management staff  the loss of whose services could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition among medical device companies for highly skilled scientific  sales and management personnel is intense 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain all personnel necessary for the development of its business 
failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company has recently experienced a significant increase in the number of its full time employees  from at april  to at april  to at june  moreover  the company intends to continue to add a significant additional number of employees to support its development and expanding manufacturing  marketing and sales efforts 
the expansion of the company s personnel has placed additional demands upon  and may significantly strain the company s management  financial systems and other resources 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully manage its growing number of employees 
failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
future capital needs and uncertainty of additional funding the company is working on the research and development of several long term projects and is placing increased emphasis on development of the hrd and other technologies  which will result in significantly increased internally funded research and development expenditures 
these costs include costs of pre clinical trials and regulatory approvals 
the company estimates that the cost of developing the hrd and other products will be significant 
these costs may include costs related to pre clinical and clinical trials and regulatory approvals 
the company estimates that it will require significant additional funds in order to complete the development and achieve regulatory approvals of the hrd and other products under development 
generally  estimates of long term project costs are extremely imprecise and cost overruns are common 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the company will not require significantly more resources to complete the development of the hrd and its other products 
the company plans to fund this effort through a combination of the hrd contract  existing resources  sales of additional securities and cash flow from sales of its existing products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain sufficient funds on favorable terms  if at all  to complete the development of the hrd and other products 
moreover  the company may require additional funds to commence the manufacture and marketing of the hrd or any of the company s other products under development in commercial quantities  if and when approved or cleared by the regulatory authorities 
failure of the company to obtain any required additional funding could delay product development and otherwise materially and adversely affect the business of the company 
competition and technological change competition in the cardiac assist market is intense and subject to rapid technological change and evolving industry requirements and standards 
many of the companies developing or marketing cardiac assist products have substantially greater financial  product development  sales and marketing resources and experience than the company 
these competitors may develop superior products or products of similar quality at the same or lower prices 
moreover  there can be no assurance that improvements in current or new technologies will not make them technically equivalent or superior to the company s products in addition to providing cost or other advantages 
other advances in medical technology  biotechnology and pharmaceuticals may reduce the size of the potential markets for the company s products or render those products obsolete 
the bvs is the only device that can provide full circulatory assistance approved by the fda as a bridge to recovery device for the treatment of all patients with reversible heart failure 
in may  thoratec laboratories corporation received fda approval to market their device for postcardiotomy recovery of the natural heart  which represents the primary patient population historically addressed by the bvs 
the company is not aware of any other company that has applied for fda approval of a device which is competitive with the bvs 
approval by the fda of products that compete directly with the bvs increases competitive pricing and other pressures and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is aware of other heart replacement device development efforts in the united states  canada  europe and japan 
a joint effort between pennsylvania state university  m corporation  inc and minnetronix  inc 
is developing a heart replacement device with significant nhlbi support 
there are a number of companies  including thermo cardiosystems  inc and novacor  a division of baxter international  inc  which are developing permanent cardiac assist products  including implantable left ventricular assist devices lvads and miniaturized rotary ventricular assist devices  that may address markets that overlap with those targeted by the company s hrd 
the company s customers frequently have limited budgets 
as a result  the company s products compete against the broad range of medical devices for these limited funds 
the company s success will depend in large part upon its ability to enhance its existing products and to develop new products to meet regulatory and customer requirements and to achieve market acceptance 
the company believes that important competitive factors with respect to the development and commercialization of its products include the relative speed with which it can develop products  establish clinical utility  complete clinical testing and regulatory approval processes  obtain reimbursement and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
government regulation clinical testing  manufacture and sale of the company s products and products under development  including the bvs and the hrd  are or will be subject to regulation by the fda and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies 
noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in  among other things  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  failure of the government to grant pre market clearance or pre market approval for devices  withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecution 
the fda also has the authority to request repair  replacement or refund of the cost of any device manufactured or distributed by the company 
any devices  including the bvs  which are manufactured or distributed by the company pursuant to fda clearances or approvals  are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the fda and certain state agencies 
manufacturers of medical devices for marketing in the united states are required to adhere to the fda s quality system regulation and must also comply with medical devices reporting requirements that a firm report to the fda any incident in which its product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury  or in which its product malfunctioned and  if the malfunction were to recur  it would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury 
labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the fda and  in certain circumstances  by the federal trade commission 
current fda enforcement policy prohibits the marketing of approved medical devices for unapproved uses 
the company is subject to routine inspection by the fda and certain state agencies for compliance with the quality system regulation and medical device reporting requirements  as well as other applicable regulations 
the company is also subject to regulation in each of the foreign countries in which it sells its products 
many of the regulations applicable to the company s products in these counties are similar to those of the fda 
the company believes that foreign regulations relating to the manufacture and sale of medical devices are becoming more stringent 
the european union has adopted regulations requiring that medical devices comply with the medical device directive by june   which includes iso and ce certification 
the company s bvs currently is not yet certified for iso compliance 
the company has substantially completed the requirements to obtain iso and ce certification from an accredited registrar for its bvs operations 
while there can be no assurance that the company will obtain such certification in a timely manner  if at all  the company believes that it will be certified in the near term with no discernable negative effect on its european sales 
until iso and ce certification are obtained  the company s sale of the bvs into the european union will be restricted 
many manufacturers of medical devices  including the company  have often relied on foreign markets for the initial commercial introduction of their products 
the more stringent foreign regulatory environment could make it more difficult  costly and time consuming for the company to pursue this strategy for new products 
any fda  foreign or state regulatory approvals or clearances  once obtained  can be withdrawn or modified 
delay in the company obtaining  or inability of the company to obtain and maintain  any necessary united states or foreign clearances or approvals for new or existing products or product enhancements  or cost overruns resulting from these regulatory requirements  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
reliance on government contracts the company generally relies on external funding for its basic research and development  primarily through government research contracts and grants 
such funding has been obtained for the initial development of most of the company s current products and products under development 
in particular  in september  the company was awarded by the nhlbi a four year million extension to its hrd contract  and in september the company was awarded a five year million contract from the nhlbi for the development of the company s heart booster 
as of march   the company s total backlog of government contracts and grants was million 
such contracts and grants are not expected to be sufficient to commercialize the underlying products  and for certain products  including the hrd  the cost of product development in excess of the contract value is expected to be significant 
the company s strategy is to continue to seek government contracts and grants to support development efforts 
funding for the company s government research and development contracts is subject to government appropriation  and all of these contracts contain provisions  which make them terminable at the convenience of the government 
there can be no assurance that the government will not terminate or reduce or delay the funding for any of the company s contracts 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining any new government contracts or further extensions to existing contracts 
a significant delay or reduction of funding under the company s government contracts could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on limited sources of supply the company relies on outside vendors to supply certain components used in the bvs and in its products under development 
certain of the components of the bvs are supplied by sole source vendors or are custom made for the company 
from time to time  suppliers of certain components of the bvs have indicated that they intend to discontinue  or have discontinued  making such components 
in addition  certain of these components are supplied from single sources due to quality considerations  costs or constraints imposed by regulatory authorities 
there are relatively few additional sources of supply for certain components and establishing additional or replacement suppliers for such components cannot be accomplished quickly and may require fda approval 
in the past  certain suppliers have announced that  due to government regulation or in an effort to reduce potential product liability exposure  they intend to limit or terminate sales of certain products to the medical industry 
there can be no assurance that  if such an interruption were to occur  the company would be able to find suitable alternative supplies at reasonable prices or would be able to obtain requisite regulatory approvals in a timely manner  if at all 
similarly  when and if the company reaches the clinical testing stage of its products under development  it may find that certain components become more difficult to source from outside vendors due to the product liability risk perceived by those vendors 
the company s inability to obtain acceptable components in a timely manner or to find suitable replacements at an acceptable cost would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on third party reimbursement the company s bvs product is  and most of its products under development are intended to be  sold to medical institutions 
medical institutions and their physicians typically seek reimbursement for the use of these products from third party payers  including medicare  medicaid  private health insurers and managed care organizations 
as a result  market acceptance of the company s current and proposed products may depend in large part on the extent to which reimbursement is available to medical institutions and their physicians for use of the company s products 
the level of reimbursement provided by united states and foreign third party payers varies according to a number of factors  including the medical procedure category  payer  location  outcome and cost 
in the united states  many private health care insurance carriers follow the recommendations of hcfa  which establishes guidelines for the reimbursement of health care providers treating medicare and medicaid patients 
internationally  medical reimbursement systems vary significantly 
in certain countries  medical center budgets are fixed regardless of levels of patient treatment 
in other countries  such as japan  reimbursement from government or third party payers must be applied for and approved 
as of the date of this annual report  under hcfa guidelines  medicare reimburses medical institutions for medicare patients based on the category of surgical procedures in which the bvs is used and incrementally reimburses physicians for the use of the bvs 
medicare does not  however  currently reimburse medical institutions for the incremental cost of using the bvs above the amount allowed for the reimbursement category of the surgical procedure 
certain private health insurers and managed care providers provide incremental reimbursement to both the medical institutions and their physicians 
the company is currently petitioning hcfa to assign a higher paying reimbursement category whenever the bvs is used 
in october  hcfa established a special icd code for the bvs in an effort to more clearly track and evaluate hospital and physician costs associated specifically with the bvs compared to current reimbursement levels  so that hcfa can determine the appropriate category and level of reimbursement 
there can be no assurance that hcfa will reassign the bvs to a higher paying category in a timely manner  if at all 
no reimbursement levels have been established for the company s products under development  including the hrd 
prior to approving coverage for new medical devices  most third party payers require evidence that the product has received fda approval or clearance for marketing  is safe and effective and not experimental or investigational  and is medically necessary and appropriate for the specific patient for whom the product is being used 
increasing numbers of third party payers require evidence that the procedures in which the products are used  as well as the products themselves are cost effective 
there can be no assurance that the company s products under development will meet these criteria  that third party payers will reimburse physicians and medical institutions for the use of the products or that the level of reimbursement will be sufficient to support the widespread use of the products 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that third party payers will continue to provide reimbursement for the use of bvs or that such payers will not reduce the current level of reimbursement for the product 
failure to achieve adequate reimbursement for its current or proposed products would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
potential inadequacy of product liability insurance the company s business involves the risk of product liability claims inherent in the manufacture and marketing of life support systems 
there are many factors beyond the control of the company that could result in the failure of the bvs to sustain the life of a patient  the most important of which is the condition of the patient prior to the use of the product 
as a result  many of the patients using the bvs do not survive 
in addition  the effectiveness of the company s products could be adversely affected by the reliability of the physicians  nurses and technicians using and monitoring the use of the product  and the maintenance of the product by the company s customers 
the failure of the bvs or any other life support system under development by the company to save a life could give rise to product liability claims and result in negative publicity that could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company currently maintains product liability insurance  subject to certain deductibles and exclusions 
there can be no assurance that this insurance will be sufficient to protect the company from product liability claims  or that product liability insurance will continue to be available to the company at a reasonable cost  if at all 
the risk of product liability claims against the company may increase as the company introduces new products under development  particularly products such as the hrd intended for permanent life support 
the hrd will have a finite life and could cause unintended complications to other organs 
the eventual failure of the hrd could give rise to product liability claims  regardless of whether the hrd has extended or improved the quality of the patient s life beyond that expected without the use of the hrd 
as a result of the additional product liability risks that will be associated with the hrd and other products under development by the company  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to secure product liability insurance for these products  when and if developed  or that such insurance will be sufficient to protect the company at an acceptable cost 
the failure of the company to be able to obtain adequate product liability insurance  if any  for these products could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on patents and proprietary rights the company s business depends significantly upon its proprietary technology 
the company relies on a combination of trade secret laws  patents  copyrights  trademarks and confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions to establish  maintain and protect its proprietary rights  all of which afford only limited protection 
there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to the company s trade secrets or disclose such technology or that the company can meaningfully protect its trade secrets 
the company has been issued or allowed patents and has pending five patent applications in the united states 
the company has obtained or applied for corresponding patents for certain of these patents and patent applications in a limited number of foreign countries 
these patents relate to the bvs and certain of its products under development including the hrd 
the company s united states patents expire at various times from to there can be no assurance that the company s pending patent applications or any future applications will be approved  that any patents will provide the company with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties  or that the patents of others will not render the company s patents obsolete or otherwise have an adverse effect on the company s ability to conduct business 
because foreign patents may afford less protection under foreign law than is available under united states patent law  there can be no assurance that any such patents issued to the company will adequately protect the company s proprietary information 
others may have filed and may file patent applications in the future that are similar or identical to those of the company 
to determine the priority of inventions  the company may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office or opposition proceedings before a foreign patent office that could result in substantial cost to the company 
no assurance can be given that any such interfering patent or patent application will not have priority over patent applications filed on behalf of the company or that the company will prevail in any opposition proceeding 
the medical device industry is characterized by a large number of patents and by frequent and substantial intellectual property litigation 
there can be no assurance that the company s products and technologies do not infringe or violate any patents or proprietary rights of third parties 
the company has in the past and may in the future be notified that it may be infringing or violating proprietary rights possessed by others 
any intellectual property litigation would be costly and could divert the efforts and attention of the company s management and technical personnel  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that infringement or other claims will not be asserted in the future or such assertions  if proven to be true  will not prevent the company from selling its products or materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
if any such claims are asserted against the company s proprietary rights  it may seek to enter into a royalty or licensing arrangement 
there can be no assurance  however  that a license will be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
the company could decide  in the alternative  to resort to litigation to challenge such claims or to design around the patented or otherwise proprietary technology 
such actions could be costly and would divert the efforts and attention of the company s management and technical personnel  which would materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
on january   world heart corporation and the ottawa heart institute research corporation filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of delaware 
the complaint seeks damages and injunctive relief for alleged breaches of contract  misappropriation of trade secrets  conversion of trade secrets and patent infringement by the company 
these claims and allegations relate to certain technology used in its transcutaneous energy transmission system that is a component of the hrd under development by the company 
the company does not believe that it is infringing any patent or other intellectual property rights of the plaintiffs and intends to vigorously defend this position 
there can be no assurance that the company will prevail in the defense of these claims and allegation or in the defense of any future infringement or other claim  if made 
if infringement or violation of the patent or other proprietary rights were determined to exist  the company would either be required to use or develop alternative technology for its transcutaneous energy transmission system or to seek a license of the technology 
there can be no assurance that the company could obtain a license of this technology on a timely basis or on reasonable terms  if at all 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company could develop or license alternative technology on a timely basis  if at all  to allow for the safe and effective transmission of energy into the body without wires penetrating the skin 
as a result  a determination of infringement or violation could have a material adverse effect on the company s development of the hrd and on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
any patent or intellectual property dispute or litigation could result in product development delays  would be costly and could divert the efforts and attention of the company s management and technical personnel  and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
year compliance as the year approaches  it is generally anticipated that computers  software and other equipment utilizing microprocessors may be unable to function properly 
the company has evaluated this potential issue with respect to its products  its financial and management information systems and it suppliers 
with respect to the company s products  the software controlling the bvs drive console includes internal counters  but the bvs operation is not related in any way to a specific calendar date 
accordingly  the company believes that the bvs will not need any repair or modification with regard to the year issue 
with respect to the company s financial and management information systems  the company must upgrade the application software to be year compliant 
the supplier of the software has developed a year compliant version of the software and the company anticipates upgrading its systems to this version prior to the end of fiscal because on april  the company begins its fiscal year  the company anticipates that if it does not upgrade its financial and management information systems in fiscal  it may encounter year compliance issues as early as april with respect to its suppliers  the company is beginning to communicate with key suppliers to assess their vulnerability to the year issue and intends to increase inventory levels of certain key components to help mitigate the risk of certain suppliers not being able to supply materials on a timely basis due to systems issues 
any interruption to the company s ability to operate and manufacture product due to the effect of the year issue on the company s systems or on the systems of its suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations
