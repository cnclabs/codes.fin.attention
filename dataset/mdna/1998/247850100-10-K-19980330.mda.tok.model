the majority of deltic s computer equipment and financial system software was purchased when the company was spun off from murphy

in addition  the oversupply of lumber that developed in the second half of and the resulting depressed prices may extend into the company expects that timber sales by the united states government will remain at historically low levels  and increasing environmental pressures in canada  along with the canada united states lumber quota agreement  will prevent any significant increase in canadian imports 
pine sawtimber harvested from the company s fee lands is projected to increase annually through the year  depending on the company s ability to increase timber inventory through growth and timberland acquisitions 
lumber production is also projected to increase over this period  as the company continues to increase the capacity of its manufacturing facilities
