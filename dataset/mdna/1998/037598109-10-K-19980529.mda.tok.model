item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in fiscal  we continued our focus on company wide efforts to improve margins  productivity  working capital usage and capital allocation 
for most of our businesses  we achieved improved profitability on increased net sales in fiscal however  the success of these efforts was significantly overshadowed by operating losses and nonrecurring charges related to international curtainwall construction activities 
during the year  we made the strategic decision to close or exit our european and asian curtainwall operations and to focus more selectively on higher margin domestic curtainwall business 
related to these actions  european operations have been deconsolidated  reflecting our ceding of control over those entities 
consequently  the net operating results of european operations for fiscal have been included in our consolidated results of operations under the caption unusual items  which also includes two nonrecurring charges related to international curtainwall operations 
the net liability associated with these businesses was included in accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet at february  the closure of these european and asian curtainwall operations will permit the company to focus on other business markets that management believes will provide opportunity for greater returns on capital invested 
a more detailed description of our results for and financial position is provided in this financial review

our glass technologies gt and auto glass ag segments reported net sales gains of and  respectively 
gt s net sales grew primarily due to continued strong demand for its fabricated glass products  particularly the viracon unit s high performance architectural glass 
ag increased net sales by combining nominal retail same store net sales growth  the addition of retail and wholesale locations  and the full year inclusion of portland glass  which the segment acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal building products services bps net sales dropped  nearly two thirds related to the deconsolidation of european curtainwall operations 
domestic and asian curtainwall net sales fell  while net sales of bps noncurtainwall businesses grew 
on a consolidated basis  cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  fell to its lowest figure this decade  dropping 
the deconsolidation of european curtainwall results accounted for two thirds of the margin improvement 
productivity gains at most of our fabrication operations  most notably viracon and viratec thin films viratec  and a shift in net sales mix away from low margin curtainwall construction business combined to produce the remainder of this positive variance 
bps reported improved margins for all but its international operations 
these factors were partly offset by higher costs experienced by the ag segment s retail and distribution operations 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses grew by million  or 
as a result  sg a costs increased as a percent of net sales 
the primary factors were higher salaries  outside services  increased information systems and marketing costs  particularly at our ag segment 
sg a expenses in fiscal also included million in foreign currency translation losses in bps asian curtainwall unit  a million write off of certain information systems assets  primarily in ag  and severance costs associated with certain management changes 
in fiscal  pre tax charges of million were included in our consolidated results of operations under the caption unusual items 
the above amount included nonrecurring charges of million and million recorded in the third and fourth quarter  respectively  related to our international curtainwall operations 
in addition  unusual items included operating losses totaling million  representing the net operating results for european curtainwall operations which were deconsolidated as described in the above introductory paragraph 
net interest expense rose nominally in fiscal increased interest income from investments held by the company s captive insurance subsidiary and lower interest rates offset nearly all of the effect of higher borrowings under our revolver and uncommitted credit lines 
we expect higher debt levels and interest expense for fiscal due to the financing of higher capital investments 
our income tax benefit amounted to of our net loss before income taxes 
the unusually low effective rate was primarily due to foreign operating activity for which no tax benefit was recognized 
our share of net losses recorded by various affiliated companies in which we have a or less equity interest amounted to  in fiscal compared to  last year 
apogee s fiscal net loss was million  or diluted loss per share 
this compared to net earnings of million  or diluted earnings per share  a year ago 
the negative return on average shareholders equity was in fiscal versus a positive return of for fiscal at february   our consolidated backlog stood at million  down from a year ago 
this reduction was primarily attributable to the closure of our international curtainwall business 
approximately million of the february backlog will not be reflected as net sales in fiscal segment analysis the following information provides a more detailed look at each of our three business segments 
also see note business segment information on page for a three year history of each segment s net sales  operating income loss  identifiable assets  capital expenditures  and depreciation and amortization 
dollar amounts in thousands glass technologies net sales    operating income    auto glass net sales    operating income    building products services net sales    operating income loss    glass technologies gt posted record net sales and operating income for the fifth consecutive year 
net sales rose by  while operating income improved to million 
the net sales increase reflected improvements by each of the segment s units 
most of the segment s earnings improvement came from viracon  our high performance architectural glass fabrication unit 
viracon posted net sales and operating income growth of and  respectively 
the gains were due to strong demand for its architectural glass products  improved product mix  and improved productivity 
viracon ran near full capacity during the year  even as expanded production capacity was added 
in response to continued strong demand for its segment s high performance architectural glass products  viracon will begin construction of a new architectural glass fabrication complex in statesboro  georgia 
this facility  expected to be operational in fiscal  together with enhancements at viracon s existing facility  will eventually increase viracon s capacity by over 
viratec reported improved results in fiscal viratec  which applies optical grade coatings to glass and other substrates  saw its net sales grow by  while operating earnings nearly quadrupled 
both improvements were primarily due to viratec s optium tm cathode ray tube coating operation formerly known as cart 
optium net sales more than doubled for the year and the unit reported a small operating profit versus a sizable loss in the prior year 
viratec s flat glass operations had a double digit net sales gain  but industry pricing pressure and production downtime related to an ongoing capacity expansion caused the operation to report lower earnings 
at february   viratec s backlog was lower than last year s year end backlog  primarily due to the suspension of the optium business related to its expected relocation 
during fiscal  viratec s optium line is expected to be moved to a location closer to the flow of customers computer monitor supply chains  reducing shipping costs and breakage risks 
the segment s tru vue unit  our custom picture framing glass and matboard fabricator  also posted improved net sales and operating earnings for the year 
these results occurred despite somewhat soft industry sales  as the unit again successfully controlled its production costs 
tru vue plans to move to a new facility in fiscal this should allow for increased capacity and improved productivity for both its picture framing glass and matboard operations 
based on current order rates and industry conditions  gt expects to report higher net sales and solid operating results in fiscal however  each of the segment s operating units will be affected by the start up costs and disruptions associated with significant capital projects  making earnings improvements difficult to project 
the extent of earnings gains will be highly dependent on the ability of its business units to reach operational status for each project as planned 
auto glass ag operates retail stores under the harmon autoglass harmon name and distribution centers under the glass depot name 
due to an industry merger in  ag became the second largest company in the auto glass repair and replacement industry 
ag reported net sales improvement in fiscal despite lower unit sales demand in the replacement auto glass industry 
approximately one third of the net sales growth was due to the fourth quarter fiscal acquisition of portland glass 
the segment s net sales growth continued to outpace the industry 
market data indicated that unit demand for replacement auto glass in the us fell from despite the net sales increase  ag s operating income fell to million  a decline 
margin pressures intensified throughout the year due to intense competition  particularly at the retail level 
lower margins  and higher selling and administrative costs were the primary factors behind the decline 
the segment also recorded a million write off of certain information systems assets 
same location retail net sales rose by  while unit net sales declined 
the segment s curvlite operation fabricates auto glass for the replacement auto glass aftermarket 
curvlite increased net sales in fiscal by about 
the unit s national distribution center  which offers other manufacturers products as well as its own for both domestic and foreign vehicles  and the autoglass express program  a delivery system to fill customer orders more quickly and completely  accounted for much of the unit s net sales growth 
about of curvlite s net sales were made to glass depot units in fiscal during the year  ag completed four small acquisitions 
these acquisitions  combined with other locations added during the year  increased the number of locations to harmon retail locations and glass depot distribution centers 
the segment continues to explore opportunities to expand the reach of its businesses 
the merger of the industry s two largest companies may provide ag with an enhanced position as insurance companies adjust their allocations of business to maintain their own flexibility and access to competitive pricing 
insurance companies  which make up about of the replacement auto glass market  prefer vendors who can expedite claims processing and other administrative efforts related to auto glass replacement and repair 
the segment has the ability to offer comprehensive claims processing services to these customers on a nationwide basis 
partly due to the aforementioned factors  ag expects to report higher net sales in fiscal with unit growth from market penetration and start up or acquired locations 
meanwhile  the segment is taking actions to reduce its cost structure and improve productivity  particularly in its retail operations 
however  the continued uncertainty of industry unit sales and pricing makes it difficult to project operating earnings for fiscal building products services bps posted a million operating loss in fiscal  compared with operating income of million a year ago 
other than the segment s international curtainwall operations  bps operating units recorded solid results  with operating income for those units higher than a year ago 
as expected  segment net sales decreased to million  or of consolidated net sales  which represented bps lowest percentage contribution to apogee s total net sales in over years 
two thirds of the decrease related to the deconsolidation of european curtainwall operations 
adjusting for this factor  bps net sales would have fallen 
domestic and asian curtainwall net sales fell by and  respectively  due primarily to our decision to focus more selectively on higher margin domestic curtainwall business and the closure of our asian curtainwall business 
net sales of bps noncurtainwall businesses grew 
the operating loss was primarily due to international curtainwall operations and included two nonrecurring pre tax charges amounting to million related to exit activities and other unusual items 
a million pre tax provision for restructuring and other unusual items was recorded in the third quarter 
the provision also included amounts for the estimated loss associated with certain disputed construction contract receivables in europe  including the accrual of certain penalty amounts  and the accrual of costs associated with the resolution of legal proceedings related to organizational changes in its european curtainwall unit 
in the fourth quarter  we recorded a million pre tax provision for exiting all european curtainwall and related operations  including the completion of certain remaining projects 
in addition to the nonrecurring charges  international curtainwall operations posted an operating loss of million  reflecting significant cost overruns at certain projects in europe and asia 
the operations also sustained sizable foreign currency translation losses on asian assets  particularly those held in malaysia 
despite a decline in net sales  our domestic curtainwall unit produced sharply higher profits  aided by the completion of the getty museum project as well as by reductions in overhead and operating costs 
bps noncurtainwall businesses posted another year of solid results 
net sales for these units rose  while operating profits totaled million 
the segment s full service business had another solid year  generating slightly higher net sales 
a favorable shift in net sales mix towards higher margin service business helped the unit s profitability 
the detention security unit also reported slightly higher net sales 
however  operating income fell as improved earnings from contracting were offset by losses from a start up operation 
the wausau architectural products unit leveraged higher net sales into sharply higher profitability as the unit improved its engineering and fabrication productivity 
these businesses enter fiscal with backlog higher than a year earlier 
at february   bps backlog was million 
of this amount  curtainwall operations accounted for million 
the domestic curtainwall backlog was essentially unchanged from a year ago  while the asian backlog fell by 
the absence of significant operating losses from international curtainwall activities should enable bps to report favorable earnings comparisons in fiscal the segment anticipates lower net sales from domestic curtainwall operations with better overall project margins  but the smaller domestic net sales base makes it unlikely that operating income for that unit can match fiscal levels 
overall  bps noncurtainwall businesses are expected to post another year of improved results 
ultimate outcomes will continue to depend on bps ability to control costs  effectively manage projects  maintain margins inherent in the segment s backlog and book additional contracts 
fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales grew to million in fiscal  largely reflecting gains by our gt and ag segments 
gt s net sales grew primarily due to continued strong demand and firm pricing for its fabricated architectural glass products and the addition of net sales from the newly acquired viratec thin films viratec unit 
despite a very challenging industry environment  our ag segment increased net sales by combining retail same store net sales growth of with additional retail and wholesale locations and strong net sales growth at curvlite 
bps net sales were essentially unchanged from the prior year 
fiscal comprised weeks  the additional week accounting for approximately of the consolidated net sales that year  while fiscal comprised weeks 
overall  cost of sales  as a percent of net sales  fell from the previous year 
slight productivity gains at most of our operations  sharply lower insurance costs due to reserve reductions and a significant change in net sales mix away from the low margin curtainwall construction activity of bps new construction unit combined to produce this positive variance 
sg a expenses grew  reflecting increased information systems and marketing costs  particularly at our ag segment  and higher profit sharing and commission expense related to higher net sales and improved profitability 
as a result  sg a costs as a percent of net sales rose  despite the moderate net sales gain and productivity measures undertaken by our operating segments 
net interest expense rose  primarily due to the impact of interest paid associated with the settlement of outstanding tax matters 
our effective tax rate dropped to from in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the tax benefits related to higher export net sales levels and the resolution of prior years tax examinations 
these items were partially offset by foreign operating losses for which no tax benefit was recognized 
as explained below  the inclusion of of the results of marcon coatings marcon and viratec in our consolidated financial statements means that equity in net earnings of affiliates in no longer included a interest in those units 
the  charge to earnings in fiscal reflected our share of net losses recorded by various affiliated companies in which we have a or less equity stake 
minority interest rose due to a larger loss at harmon europe sa  a owned french subsidiary 
consolidated net earnings advanced in fiscal to million  or a share  from million  or a share  in fiscal return on shareholders equity rose to from a year earlier 
the aforementioned per share figures reflect the two for one stock split  effected in the form of a stock dividend  paid to shareholders on february  apogee ended fiscal with a million backlog  down from million at the end of fiscal segment analysis the following information provides a more detailed look at each of our three segments 
also see note business segment information on page for a three year history of each segment s net sales  operating income loss  identifiable assets  capital expenditures  and depreciation and amortization 
glass technologies gt included viracon  our architectural glass fabricator  tru vue  our picture framing glass and matboard fabricator  and viratec  which applies optical grade coatings to glass and other substrates 
as described below  viratec was acquired along with marcon  which applies coatings to architectural and residential building glass  and was merged into viracon s operations 
beginning in march  marcon and viratec were consolidated with our other majority owned business units 
through fiscal  our equity in marcon s and viratec s net earnings was included in the consolidated results of operations under the caption equity in net earnings of affiliated companies 
in january  we agreed to pay our joint venture partner jv partner million for its interest in marcon viratec and certain leased assets 
this agreement also included the irrevocable release of both parties from all outstanding claims related to the litigation as described hereafter 
in november  our jv partner in marcon viratec commenced litigation against us  alleging claims for damages and seeking to have the court order us to sell our interest to the jv partner 
we filed counterclaims seeking to have the jv partner s interest sold to us 
in march  the court ordered the jv partner to sell the shares of stock representing its interest in marcon viratec to us upon payment by us of fair value for those shares as determined by the court after further proceedings 
as a result of the court order  the jv partner s rights and status as shareholder and directors were terminated and marcon viratec was consolidated in our financial statements beginning in the first quarter of fiscal the jv partner s claims against us for damages were still pending and the court also was considering a motion brought by the jv partner to add a claim for punitive damages until agreement was reached by the parties in january gt improved net sales and earnings for the fifth consecutive year  exceeding fiscal s record results 
net sales rose  while operating income improved to million 
the net sales increase was due to continued strong demand and firm pricing for its fabricated architectural glass products and the addition of net sales from the acquired viratec unit 
while the segment contributed of consolidated net sales  it provided of our consolidated operating income 
viracon experienced continued strong demand for its architectural glass products 
this unit ran at or near full capacity for most of the year 
viracon s operating income grew 
further production capacity was added in and additional increases were planned for tru vue posted marginally improved net sales and operating income in fiscal these results occurred against a backdrop of soft industry net sales 
the unit was successful in controlling costs and made progress toward integrating its matboard operations with its picture framing glass business 
on a pro forma basis  viratec saw its net sales fall  although year end activity reflected high incoming order rates 
in fiscal  industry pricing pressure for its flat glass coated products and the unit s inability to reach operating profitability for its direct coat business combined to reduce operating income when compared to fiscal at march   viratec s backlog of million was more than double the prior year s million year end backlog 
auto glass ag reported modestly improved results in fiscal the segment net sales grew during the year despite intense competition and lower unit movement in the replacement auto glass industry 
operating income increased 
this increase resulted mainly from the above mentioned increase in net sales  which more than offset the increase in information systems and marketing expense associated with the segment s drive to expand market coverage and develop new services to meet customers needs 
ag  which operates retail stores under the harmon autoglass harmon name and distribution centers under the glass depot name  possessed the third largest market share in the auto glass repair and replacement industry during fiscal insurance companies continued to prefer vendors who could expedite claims processing and other administrative efforts related to auto glass replacement and repair 
the segment s significant investment in information systems provided harmon the means to offer comprehensive claims processing and management services to these customers on a nationwide basis 
curvlite  ag s auto glass fabricator  increased net sales in fiscal by 
the unit s national distribution center  which in fiscal began to offer other manufacturers products as well as its own for both domestic and foreign vehicles  and autoglass express program  a new delivery system which allowed curvlite to fill customer orders more quickly and completely  accounted for much of the unit s net sales growth 
about of curvlite s net sales were made to glass depot units 
in january  harmon completed its acquisition of portland glass  a location auto glass replacement chain operating in the northeast us this acquisition  combined with other locations added during the year  increased the number of locations to harmon retail locations and glass depot distribution centers 
at march   ag also had midas muffler franchises 
building products services bps posted its first operating profit in five years in fiscal  recording earnings of million 
overall net sales were flat compared to a year earlier 
higher net sales by our detention security  full service and architectural products units were offset by lower domestic curtainwall net sales and the absence of net sales from the nanik window coverings businesses sold in fiscal overseas net sales grew marginally for the year 
other than the segment s european operations  each of bps operating units recorded solid operating earnings improvement compared to fiscal harmon  ltd  bps domestic and international curtainwall unit  experienced flat results as the domestic and asian operations improved earnings were offset by a large operating loss in europe 
the european loss reflected high risk projects taken and executed at unacceptably low margins 
the improvement in operating earnings by our domestic and asian curtainwall units was achieved through overhead and operating cost reductions  and improved management of projects 
the segment s full service unit had another solid year  generating higher net sales and healthy operating income 
the detention security unit reported higher net sales and significantly greater income in fiscal however  its fiscal year end backlog was down from a year earlier 
the architectural products unit leveraged its higher net sales into sharply higher profitability as the unit improved its engineering and fabrication productivity 
at the end of fiscal  bps backlog was million  which represented almost of the consolidated total 
liquidity and capital resources financial condition net cash provided by financing activities in may  we obtained a five year  committed secured credit facility in the amount of million 
this new credit facility requires us to maintain minimum levels of net worth and certain financial ratios 
this facility replaced a million five year  multi currency committed credit facility which had been obtained in may this previous credit facility also required us to maintain minimum levels of net worth and certain financial ratios 
as a result of our losses and exit charges relating to our international curtainwall businesses in fiscal  we were not in compliance with certain financial covenants of the previous credit facility 
as we are in compliance with all of the financial covenants of the new credit facility  all bank borrowings at february  were classified as long term debt 
long term debt  including current installments of million  stood at million at february   up million from a year earlier 
most of the company s long term debt consisted of bank borrowings 
the additional borrowings were required to finance capital spending and the repurchase of common stock under the company s share repurchase program 
for fiscal  we expect outstanding borrowings will increase to fund the amount by which estimated capital spending and dividend requirements exceed the anticipated cash flow from operations 
we believe efforts to reduce working capital relative to net sales growth plus our available credit facilities will enable us to maintain adequate liquidity 
net cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operating activities in fiscal fell to million from million in fiscal the decrease primarily reflected lower net earnings  which were partly offset by favorable changes in working capital 
net receivables dropped million  primarily reflecting lower receivables in our remaining curtainwall operations  after accounting for the effect of removing european curtainwall operations from apogee s consolidation 
receivables growth at ag  gt and bps noncurtainwall businesses generally tracked sales growth in the last quarter of the fiscal year 
most of our million increase in inventories was due to gt  reflecting the segment s higher activity level 
the change in costs and earnings in excess of billings was essentially offset by the change in billings in excess of costs and earnings on uncompleted contracts 
accounts payable changed nominally after accounting for the removal of european curtainwall operations from consolidation 
year end accrued expenses were million higher than a year earlier  mainly due to accruals associated with the nonrecurring charges recorded during the year 
net cash used in investing activities new capital investment in fiscal totaled million  versus million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
additions to property  plant and equipment totaled million  and consisted primarily of expenditures for manufacturing equipment  facility expansion and upgrading of information systems throughout the company 
the ag segment completed four small acquisitions of retail auto glass replacement stores for million 
in fiscal  we intend to invest an estimated million in capital expenditures  primarily in our gt businesses 
gt plans include expenditures for the construction of an architectural glass fabrication facility in statesboro  georgia  a new tru vue facility in chicago  illinois and the move of viratec s optium cathode ray tube coating line to a new location 
shareholders equity at february   apogee s shareholders equity stood at million  down from a year ago 
our net loss  dividends paid  and the repurchase of common stock primarily accounted for the decrease slightly offset by the effect of common stock issued in connection with our stock based compensation plans 
apogee pays a quarterly dividend of cents per share 
for the year  the company repurchased  shares of common stock for million  while issuing  common shares under its stock based incentive plans 
in february  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional  shares of the company s common stock 
impact of inflation our financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis  which does not completely account for the effects of inflation 
however  since the cost of many of our inventories is determined using the last in  first out lifo method of accounting  cost of sales  except for depreciation expense included therein  generally reflects current costs 
year end prices were essentially unchanged from a year ago for the cost of glass  one of our primary raw materials 
we expect the cost of glass to remain essentially unchanged in fiscal aluminum prices at year end were slightly lower than a year ago 
while our construction and supply contracts are at fixed prices  the material components are usually based on firm quotes obtained from suppliers 
labor cost increases  including taxes and fringe benefits  rose moderately in fiscal and a moderate increase also can be reasonably anticipated for fiscal other costs are managed to minimize the inflationary pressures that exist in markets for goods and services our business operations require 
impact of year we are reviewing the potential impact of the year date change which involves the inability of certain software and systems to properly recognize and process date information relating to the year we have assigned a team to evaluate the nature and extent of the work required to make our systems  products and infrastructure year compliant 
a number of existing systems projects are either underway or under review within our various business units to incorporate year compliance  the cost of which has not been determined 
we continue to evaluate the estimated costs associated with our efforts to ensure that our systems  products and infrastructure are year compliant 
while these on going efforts will involve additional costs  we believe  based on available information  that we are and will continue to effectively manage our year transition without any material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition
