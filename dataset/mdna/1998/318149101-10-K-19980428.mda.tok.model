item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business environment gkn holding corp 
and its subsidiaries the company are primarily engaged in institutional research  investment banking  securities brokerage and securities trading  with an emphasis on small and mid capitalization companies 
this represents a change during the fiscal year ended january   away from a focus on emerging growth and micro cap companies 
this reorientation was in part driven by the acquisition of southeast research partners  inc southeast research and by a degradation of the business fundamentals surrounding the micro cap marketplace 
the company s profitability is affected by many factors  including general economic and market conditions and the volatility of trading markets  specifically the small and mid capitalization market 
the company acquired southeast research on march  southeast research brought a proven track record of institutional quality research and institutional brokerage 
the acquisition of southeast research added nine new research analysts to the company  including four current or prior institutional investor all stars 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for descriptions of the company s acquisitions 
the securities industry as a whole experienced another year of record setting results during calendar year and the company s fiscal year ended january  this happened despite a rapidly deteriorating climate for micro cap stocks  where the company has historically had a strong franchise 
declining volumes combined with regulatory moves to depress this market 
regulatory changes by the sec and nasd relating to underwriting and trading of micro cap stocks sought to reduce investors transaction costs and widen the distribution of new offerings 
unfortunate and perhaps unintended consequences of these moves were more volatile after market and other trading  as well as declining access to capital for micro cap issuers 
these events significantly impacted our financial results for the year 
combining the acquisition of southeast research with the macro economic changes to our business led us to a thorough analysis and self assessment of our business structure 
as a result  the company has altered its focus and mission to evolve into a preeminent relationship based  research driven niche investment bank focusing on small and mid capitalization companies offering integrated research  investment banking  institutional and retail brokerage  and asset management
