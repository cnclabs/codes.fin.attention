general cygnus is engaged in the development and manufacture of diagnostic and drug delivery systems  utilizing its proprietary technologies to satisfy unmet medical needs cost effectively 
the company s current efforts are primarily focused on two core areas a painless  bloodless and automatic glucose monitoring device the glucowatch system and transdermal drug delivery systems 
the company s product development efforts have been and are expected to continue to be either self funded  funded by licensees or distributors  or both 
in general  the company s agreements provide that cygnus will manufacture its products and receive manufacturing revenues from sales of these products to its licensees or distributors 
cygnus may also receive royalties based on certain of its licensees or distributors product sales 
in certain circumstances  the company may elect to license manufacturing rights for a product to its licensee in exchange for a technology transfer fee and or a higher royalty rate 
cygnus licensees and distributors generally have the right to abandon a product development effort at any time for any reason without significant penalty 
such cancellations may result in delays  suspension or abandonment of clinical testing  the preparation and processing of regulatory filings and product development and commercialization efforts 
licensees have exercised this right in the past  and there can be no assurance that current and future licensees or distributors will not exercise this right in the future 
if a licensee or distributor were to cease funding one of the company s products  cygnus would either self fund development efforts  identify and enter into an agreement with an alternative licensee or distributor or suspend further development work on the product 
there can be no assurance that  if necessary  the company would be able to negotiate an agreement with an alternative licensee or distributor on acceptable terms 
since all payments to the company under its agreements following their execution are contingent on the occurrence of future events or sales levels  and the agreements are terminable by the licensee or distributor  no assurance can be given as to whether the company will receive any particular payment thereunder or as to the amount or timing of any such payment 
the company may choose to self fund certain research and development projects in order to exploit its technologies 
any increase in company sponsored research and development activities will have an immediate adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
however  should such company sponsored research and development activities result in a commercial product  the long term effect on the company s results of operations could be favorable 
in the past some of the company s licensees  distributors and collaborators have approached the company requesting modification of the terms of existing agreements 
becton dickinson has recently approached the company to discuss modifying the non compete terms of the existing agreement 
the company is unable to predict the outcome of these discussions 
for the company to remain competitive  it will need to develop  in license or acquire new diagnostic and drug delivery products 
furthermore  the company s ability to develop and commercialize products in the future will depend on its ability to enter into collaborative arrangements with additional licensees on favorable terms 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to enter into new collaborative arrangements on such terms  if at all 
the company s results of operations vary significantly from year to year and depend on  among other factors  the signing of new product development agreements and the timing of recognizing payment amounts specified thereunder  the timing of recognizing license or distribution fees and cost reimbursement payments made by pharmaceutical licensees  the demand for its nicotrol product  the demand for and shipments of its fempatch product  and the costs associated with its manufacture 
up front and interim milestone payments from contracts are generally earned and recognized based on the percentage of actual efforts expended compared to total expected efforts during the development period for each contract 
however  contract revenues are not always aligned with the timing of related expenses 
to date  research and development expenses have generally exceeded contract revenue in any particular period and the company expects the same situation to continue for the next few years 
in addition  the level of revenues in any given period is not necessarily indicative of expected revenues in future periods 
the company has incurred net losses each year since its inception and does not believe it will achieve profitability in at december   after recording the million arbitration settlement discussed below  the company s accumulated deficit and net capital deficiency were approximately million and million  respectively 
results of operations comparison for the years ended december  and product revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  included in product revenue  for the year ended december   are initial shipments of fempatch  the company s second commercialized product 
fempatch is a low dose  day estrogen replacement transdermal patch for the treatment of menopausal symptoms 
sanofi  the company s worldwide licensee  has sublicensed us marketing rights to warner lambert 
cygnus manufactures fempatch and first recorded revenue from its initial shipments in the third quarter of the reduction in total product revenue resulted from the discontinuation of nicotrol manufacturing in the first quarter of in may cygnus reported it had initiated arbitration proceedings against pharmacia upjohn pharmacia relating to nicotrol  cygnus smoking cessation patch 
in march of this year  cygnus announced that pharmacia exercised its option to purchase the united states manufacturing right of nicotrol 
the agreement between cygnus and pharmacia provided that pharmacia would be obligated to pay cygnus for  amount other things  existing inventory costs and for certain purchase order commitments 
pharmacia disputes its obligations regarding certain purchase order commitments 
the arbitration is intended to resolve these matters 
separately  cygnus and pharmacia are not in agreement regarding certain royalty calculations for and if this issue is unable to be resolved by the two companies  it could become part of the arbitration proceedings 
however  the company does not believe the resolution of this issue will have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations 
due to the above factors  the uncertainty of the success of the company s recently launched fempatch product  and the uncertainty regarding when and if additional products will obtain clearance from the fda and when and if licensees will sell and market such products  the company believes that the level of product revenues experienced to date are not indicative of future results and may fluctuate from year to year 
contract revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to the million for the year ended december  contract revenues primarily reflect labor and material cost reimbursements associated with certain transdermal delivery systems and the amortization of milestone payments relating to certain transdermal delivery systems and the glucose monitoring device 
the increase in contract revenues is primarily due to a million payment from pharmacia for the exercise of its option to purchase the manufacturing rights for nicotrol  as noted above 
in february  the company entered into an agreement with becton dickinson and company for the marketing and distribution of the glucowatch  a painless  automatic glucose monitoring device being developed by cygnus 
under the terms of the agreement  becton dickinson has exclusive worldwide marketing and distribution rights  with the exception of japan and korea 
cygnus will have primary responsibility for completing product development  obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing 
in addition  cygnus may participate in sales  marketing and customer service and support for the product 
in the first half of  cygnus received an up front  non refundable payment from becton dickinson 
the company is also eligible to receive future milestone payments as well as a percentage of the product s future commercial success 
in july  the company entered into an agreement with yamanouchi for the marketing and distribution of the glucowatch 
under the terms of this agreement  yamanouchi has exclusive marketing and distribution rights in japan and korea 
cygnus will have primary responsibility for completing product development and for manufacturing 
in the third quarter of  cygnus received an up front  non refundable payment from yamanouchi and is eligible to receive milestone payments as well as a percentage of the product s future commercial sales 
in july  the company also entered into a development and marketing agreement with yamanouchi for a day transdermal product to deliver a proprietary yamanouchi compound 
under the terms of the agreement  cygnus will receive funding for the development of the transdermal product and will have exclusive rights to manufacture and supply yamanouchi with the product and yamanouchi will have exclusive worldwide marketing rights to the product 
contract revenues are expected to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and from year to year  and future contract revenues cannot be reasonably predicted 
the contributing factors to achieving contract revenues include  but are not limited to  future successes in finalizing new collaborative agreements  timely achievement of milestones under current contracts  and strategic decisions on self funding certain projects 
cygnus licensees and distributors generally have the ability to abandon the rights to a product and the obligation to make related payments 
since all future payments to the company under these agreements following their execution are contingent on the occurrence of future events or sales levels  and the agreements are terminable by the licensee or distributor  no assurance can be given as to whether the company will receive any particular payment thereunder or as to the amount or timing of any such payment 
the company is unable to predict to what extent potential future terminations of existing contracts by current partners  or new collaborative agreements  if any  will impact overall contract revenues in and subsequent future periods 
royalty and other revenues for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december  the amounts include royalties from sales by pharmacia of the company s nicotine transdermal product in europe and canada and by pharmacia s marketing partner in the united states 
the net increase in royalty and other revenues is primarily due to the recognition of previously deferred royalty payments associated with the us otc sales of nicotrol during the second half of and a million reimbursement payment from pharmacia relating to inventory and purchase commitments previously expensed by the company in royalty revenue will fluctuate from period to period since it is primarily based upon sales by the company s licensees 
the level of royalty income for a product also depends on various external factors  including the size of the market for the product  product pricing levels and the ability of the company s licensee to market the product 
therefore  the level of royalty revenue for any given period is not indicative of the expected royalty revenue for future periods 
the company expects royalty and other revenue to decrease in due to the non recurring million payment mentioned above and the high level of royalty payments earned in early costs of products sold for the year ended december   were million compared to million for the year ended december  costs of products sold primarily include direct and indirect production  facility and personnel costs required to meet future anticipated production levels 
the decrease in costs of products sold largely reflects the reduction of direct expenses related to nicotrol production as a result of pharmacia exercising its option to purchase the manufacturing rights of nicotrol 
cost of products sold for the year ended december  include the initial shipments of fempatch  the company s second commercialized product 
the company experienced negative product margins for the year ended december  due to low production volumes which prevented the company from absorbing all of its fixed manufacturing costs 
due to the above factors  the uncertainty of the success of the company s recently launched fempatch product  and the uncertainty regarding when and if additional products will obtain clearance from the fda and when and if licensees will sell and market such products  the company believes that the level of costs of products sold experienced to date are not indicative of future results and may fluctuate from year to year 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  research and development and clinical activities primarily include the glucose monitoring development program  the support of the company s hormone replacement therapy products one of which  fempatch  was launched in september and two of which are in clinical trials and a contraception product 
while current levels are slightly lower than the prior year  cygnus anticipates that the development of new products  continued research of new technologies and preparation for regulatory filings and clinical trials will result in an increase in its overall research and development expenses 
marketing  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease primarily reflects decreased professional fees associated with the company s legal proceedings involving sanofi see note to the financial statements 
the company expects that marketing  general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as the company expands its operations 
arbitration settlement expense for the year ended december  was million 
as of december   the company had accrued liabilities related to the arbitration settlement of million 
these amounts represent a non recurring arbitration settlement expense 
of the total accrued liability of million  million is long term 
under the terms of the settlement  cygnus i paid sanofi million in cash in january  ii will make royalty payments of between and of any and all net sales of two products  which are subject to minimum payments in an aggregate amount equal to million  commencing in and ending in  whether or not any net sales of the two products have occurred  and iii issued in december  a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of million  payable in full at the end of four years and bearing interest at per annum 
the note will be convertible into the company s common stock at sanofi s option  exercisable at any time during the four year term  at a conversion rate of per share 
interest income  net of interest and other expense for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is due primarily to higher interest expense associated with the company s june million bank loan agreement for short term working capital 
in addition  interest income earned has decreased in conjunction with the decrease in the cash and cash equivalents balance 
there will be interest expenses recorded in reflecting the issuance of the convertible debt and the amortization of the financing fees related to this debt see note to the consolidated financial statements comparison for the years ended december  and product revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  this reflects increased demand for additional shipments of nicotrol during due to the change of nicotrol s status from a prescription to an over the counter otc product 
on july  the united states us food and drug administration the fda approved nicotrol as the first otc smoking cessation transdermal patch 
contract revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to the million for the year ended december  contract revenues primarily reflect labor and material cost reimbursements associated with certain transdermal delivery systems and the amortization of milestone payments relating to certain transdermal delivery systems and the glucose monitoring device 
in  the company received up front non refundable payments from becton dickinson and yamanouchi 
royalty and other revenues for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december  the amounts include royalties from sales by pharmacia of the company s nicotine transdermal product in europe and canada  and by pharmacia s marketing partner in the us additionally  in the first half of  amounts included the amortization of the unearned balance of prepayments from pharmacia 
as of june   all of the prepayments were fully amortized 
the net increase in royalty and other revenues is primarily due to the significant increase in volume of units shipped as a result of the change of nicotrol s status to otc in the us costs of products sold for the year ended december   were million compared to million for the year ended december  costs of products sold include direct and indirect manufacturing costs of nicotrol production and facility and personnel costs required to meet production levels 
in addition  due to uncertainties related to the level of the future sales of nicotrol  the company recorded in as part of cost of products sold  certain expenses relating to estimated committed future production costs 
costs of products sold increased primarily due to increased nicotrol shipments as a result of the change of nicotrol s status to otc in the us and the expenses related to the estimated committed future productions costs 
while the company experienced a positive product margin during due to increased demand for additional shipments of nicotrol  the company experienced negative product margins during  primarily due to low production volumes which prevented the company from absorbing all of the fixed costs associated with its production of nicotrol 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  this increase reflects the company s accelerated level of research and development costs primarily associated with the glucose monitoring system 
research and development and clinical activities primarily include the glucose monitoring development program  the support of the company s hormone replacement therapy products one of which  fempatch  was approved by fda on december  and two of which are in clinical trials  and a contraception product 
marketing  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase resulted from increased legal expenses primarily related to the sanofi arbitration  which has been settled see note to the financial statements 
interest income  net of interest and other expense for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is due primarily to interest earned on the proceeds from the company s public offering 
impact of year on january   the company implemented a new suite of financial and manufacturing applications which are fully year compliant 
the company uses these applications for the management of all financial data as well as inventory control and planning 
the company is instituting a program to analyze all other ancillary programs to ensure year compliance 
this program is expected to be completed prior to december  and is not expected to result in material expenditures to resolve year issues 
in addition the company has initiated a program to review year compliance by all major suppliers and customers in order to determine any exposure to year issues 
this program should be completed by december  it is not anticipated that there will be any significant exposure areas  but it is possible that non compliance to year concerns by major vendors or customers could have a material adverse effect on the company 
liquidity and capital resources overall  the cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances as of december  totaled million  representing a decrease of million from the total as of december  at december   the company had a negative net worth of million 
through october  the company received net proceeds of approximately million from public offerings of its common stock 
through  the company financed approximately million of manufacturing and research equipment under capital loan and lease arrangements 
in  the company entered into a new loan agreement for million to finance additional capital equipment 
borrowings under this agreement are secured by specific company assets and a security deposit of in december of  the company borrowed million under a bank line of credit to finance the purchase of manufacturing and research equipment 
this line is being repaid in monthly installments through june  as of december  there was million outstanding under this agreement 
in june  the company received million under a bank loan agreement for short term working capital 
this loan is being repaid monthly through december as of december  there was million outstanding under this agreement 
the bank loans are subject to a number of financial and other covenants 
in the event of default  the bank may  at its option  exercise its rights to remedies specified in the loan agreements which include  among other things  the acceleration of amounts due under the agreements 
as a result of recording the arbitration settlement  the company was in default of these agreements due to the breach of several financial covenants  including those related to the ratio of debt to tangible net worth and the total tangible net worth 
the company could remove the default condition on the june loan by pledging cash or certificates of deposit in the amount of of the million december  outstanding balance 
however  since the bank had agreed to forbear from exercising its rights under the loan documents until march   the company did not provide this collateral as of december  as of december   the company also was in violation of similar financial covenants with one leasing company  which had agreed to waive the covenant defaults until february  on february   the company completed financing arrangements which raised gross cash proceeds of million 
the company issued million of convertible notes and million of equity before offering costs and expenses see note to the consolidated financial statements 
both the bank and the leasing company have agreed to include the convertible debt in equity for purposes of measuring covenant compliance 
as a result of the receipt of proceeds from the financing arrangements  the company has cured the default conditions with the bank and the leasing company as of february  and the company expects to remain in compliance with these financial covenants throughout in addition to the cash received from the public offerings  equipment lease and short term working capital financing  the company has been financing its operations primarily through revenues and interest income 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million  compared with net cash used of million for year ended december  cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  was primarily due to the company s net loss of million  decrease of million in deferred revenue  decrease of million in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities and an increase of million in prepaid expenses and other current assets 
this was offset by the million increase in sanofi obligations  decrease of million in accounts receivable  million of depreciation and amortization and an increase of million in deferred compensation and other long term liabilities 
cash used in operations during the year ended december  was primarily due to the company s net loss of million  increase of million in accounts receivable offset by an increase of million in deferred revenue and million of depreciation and amortization 
the current level of cash used in operating activities is not necessarily indicative of the level of future cash usage 
for example  in january the company paid sanofi million of its arbitration settlement obligation recorded in as a result of increased expenditures for the development of new products  preparation for regulatory filings and clinical trials and the expected reduction in product revenues  the company has experienced an increase in cash usage in and anticipates an increase in cash usage for future operating activities 
net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  resulted primarily from million in capital expenditures offset by million in net maturity and sales of short term investments 
net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  resulted primarily from million in capital expenditures 
net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  included million from the exercise of warrants to purchase common stock  million of common stock issuance proceeds and million received from the company s capital equipment loan offset by million in long term debt and capital lease repayments 
net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  includes million received from the company s working capital loan and security agreement  million of common stock issuance proceeds and million received under the equipment lease agreement offset by million in long term debt and capital lease repayments 
the company s long term capital expenditure requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the progress of the company s research and development programs  the time required to obtain regulatory approvals  the resources that the company devotes to the development of self funded products  proprietary manufacturing methods and advanced technologies  the ability of the company to obtain additional licensing arrangements and to manufacture products under those arrangements  the additional expenditures to support the manufacture of new products if and when approved  and possible acquisitions of products  technologies and companies 
as the company evaluates the progress of its development projects  in particular the glucowatch and hormone replacement products  its commercialization plans and the lead time to set up manufacturing capabilities  cygnus may commence long term planning for another manufacturing site 
nevertheless  the company believes that such long term planning will not result in any material impact on cash flows and liquidity for based upon current expectations for operating losses  arbitration settlement payments  and projected short term capital expenditures  the company believes that its existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million as of december   when coupled with cash from revenues  earnings from investments and the recently completed financing arrangements which raised net proceeds of approximately million  will be sufficient to meet its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements at least through the end of however  there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional financing depending upon future business strategies  results of clinical trials and management decisions to accelerate certain research and development programs and other factors
