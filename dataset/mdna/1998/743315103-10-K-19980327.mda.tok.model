the primary market risk exposure to the fixed income portfolio is interest rate risk  which is limited by managing duration to a defined range of to years 
the distribution of maturities and convexity are monitored on a regular basis 
common stocks and similar investments  which generally have greater risk and volatility of market value  are limited to a target of  with a range of to 
market values  along with industry and sector concentrations of common stocks and similar investments  are monitored daily 
exposure to foreign currency exchange risk is limited by company restrictions and is monitored regularly 
exposures are evaluated individually and as a whole  considering the effects of cross correlation 
for the quantitative market risk disclosures  see page of the company s annual report 
the company regularly examines its portfolio for evidence of impairment 
in such cases  changes in market value are evaluated to determine the extent to which such changes are attributable to i interest rates  ii market related factors other than interest rates and iii financial conditions  business prospects and other fundamental factors specific to the issuer 
declines attributable to issuer fundamentals are reviewed in further detail 
available evidence is considered to estimate the realizable value of the investment 
when a security in the company s investment portfolio has a decline in market value which is other than temporary  the company is required by generally accepted accounting principles gaap to reduce the carrying value of such security to its net realizable value 
derivative instruments are primarily used to manage the risks and enhance the returns of the available for sale portfolio 
this is accomplished by modifying the basis  duration  interest rate or foreign currency characteristics of the portfolio or hedged securities 
derivative instruments may also be used for trading purposes 
during  net activity in the trading portfolio was not material to the company s financial position  cash flows and results of operations

at december   trading positions had a net market value of million  at december   there were no trading positions 
results of operations operating income  which excludes net realized gains and losses from security sales and one time items  was million  or per share  in  million  or per share  in and million  or per share  in the gaap combined ratio was in  in and in direct premiums written increased to  million in  compared to  million in and  million in net premiums written increased to  million in  compared to  million in and  million in the difference between direct and net premiums written is largely attributable to premiums written under state mandated involuntary commercial auto insurance procedures caip  for which the company retains no indemnity risk  of million in  million in and million in the company provided policy and claim processing services to state caips in and  compared to in premiums earned  which are a function of the amount of premiums written in the current and prior periods  increased in  compared to in and in in the company s core business units  which write insurance for private passenger automobiles  recreational vehicles and small fleets of commercial vehicles  net premiums written grew  and in  and  respectively  reflecting an increase in unit sales driven by the company s competitive rates 
the company decreased rates an average of 
in  compared to rate increases of and in and  respectively 
the company continues to write  through multiple distribution methods  standard and preferred risks  which represented between and of total core business volume 
in  the company used rating criteria based partially upon consumer financial responsibility 
this approach has been approved by numerous regulators and is in use in the states that represent of the core business units volume  the company expects to complete rollout of this approach into the remaining states where it can be offered in the company believes that its use of financial responsibility in auto insurance rating produces a more accurate distribution of losses among consumers and  therefore  produces more accurate pricing resulting in lower rates for most consumers 
in addition  in order to encourage writing more standard and preferred risks and to improve customer retention  the company in adjusted its contingent cash incentive compensation program for employees to reflect the increase in value created by adding new customers 
the company believes that growing the numbers of policyholders  particularly standard and preferred risks with their higher retention rates  builds intrinsic value because renewals are more profitable than first year business 
the drive to add customers faster resulted in more spending to promote the progressive brand and to hire and develop more claim adjusters and customer service representatives  and the company expects this to continue at least in the near term 
these costs  along with lower margins on first year business  are likely to bring profit margins more in line with the company s objective of achieving a underwriting profit margin over the entire retention period of an insured 
in  the core business units generated an underwriting profit margin of  compared to in and in claim costs  the company s most significant expense  represent actual payments made and changes in estimated future payments to be made to or on behalf of its policyholders  including expenses required to settle claims and losses 
these costs include a loss estimate for future assignments and assessments  based on current business  under state mandated involuntary automobile programs 
claims costs are influenced by inflation and loss severity and frequency  the impact of which is mitigated by adequate pricing 
increases in the rate of inflation increase loss payments  which are made after premiums are established 
accordingly  anticipated rates of inflation are taken into account when the company establishes premium rates and loss reserves 
claim costs  expressed as a percentage of premiums earned  were in  compared to in and in the company writes directors and officers and other professional liability coverage for community banks and credit unions and  therefore  could potentially be exposed to liability for errors made by these institutions relating to the year conversion 
to minimize its risk  in october  the company began including year exclusions in all new and renewal policies for commercial banks representing approximately of all policies written since that date which have multi year terms that extend beyond december  the company is not currently aware of any other company in the industry that is including such exclusion provisions or increasing their premiums to cover potential exposure on year compliance issues 
as a regulated industry  financial institutions are under pressure from government regulatory agencies and other interested parties to ensure they achieve readiness for the year the company is monitoring its customers compliance efforts and believes that substantially all such customers are pursuing plans to achieve year compliance 
it is currently unknown whether the financial institutions will be able to completely avoid errors relating to year compliance and the company is unable to predict to what extent such financial institutions will incur losses as a result of noncompliance and whether their directors and officers will be subject to individual liability for such noncompliance 
at december   approximately professional liability policies  or about of all policies  do not contain year exclusion provisions and extend into the year in the event of a claim  applicable factual and coverage issues would have to be resolved 
based on information currently available and management s best estimate  the company does not believe that it will incur any costs that will have a material impact on the company s financial condition  cash flows or results of operations 
because the company is primarily an insurer of motor vehicles  it has limited exposure for environmental  product and general liability claims 
the company has established reserves for these exposures  in amounts which it believes to be adequate based on information currently known by it 
management does not believe that these claims will have a material impact on the company s liquidity  financial condition  cash flows or results of operations 
policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses as a percentage of premiums earned were in  compared to in and in in  the company incurred additional expenses to support its infrastructure and to hire and train people in anticipation of growth 
the company also introduced its advertising campaign to states during  bringing the total number of states where the company advertises to markets 
recurring investment income interest and dividends increased to million in  compared to million in and million in  primarily due to an increase in the size of the investment portfolio 
net realized gains on security sales were million in  million in and million in investment expenses were million in  compared to million in and million in  in  the company purchased a new portfolio management system and incurred expenses related to the sale of the commercial mortgage backed securities
