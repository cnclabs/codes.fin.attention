item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except as otherwise indicated  all references to  and refer to the fiscal year ended on december of those years respectively 
introduction basis of presentation 
effective february  pld telekom inc was continued as a delaware corporation 
as a result  the consolidated financial statements for  and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
prior to  the audited consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with canadian gaap  with a reconciliation to us gaap 
ebitda  which is used as a measure of operating performance  is defined as follows earnings before taxes and minority interest plus interest interest expense less interest income plus depreciation and amortization 
principal operations and future activities 
the company s key interests at december  include a equity interest in peterstar  which provides telecommunication services in st 
petersburg  russia  a equity interest in becet  which provides cellular services in kazakstan  and an equity interest in technocom which  through its equity interest in teleport tp  operates an international teleport in moscow  fiber optic networks in moscow and its environs and a satellite based long distance network across russia 
cable wireless is the company s principal shareholder at december  the consolidation of financial information in the financial statements differs from by reflecting the company s acquisition of an additional interest in technocom effective december  the consolidation of financial information in the financial statements differs from by reflecting i the company s acquisition of of the outstanding shares of bcl in april  and ii the acquisition by technocom of a controlling voting interest in teleport tp effective december  the company s telecommunications businesses are developing rapidly in an emerging economy which  by its nature  has an uncertain economic  political and regulatory environment 
the general risks of operating businesses in the former soviet union include the possibility for rapid change in government policies  economic conditions  the tax regime and foreign currency regulations 
in addition  teleport tp s satellite based long distance network is at an early stage of its development and operations 
ultimate recoverability of the company s investments in peterstar  becet and teleport tp is dependent upon each of these subsidiaries achieving and maintaining profitability  which is dependent to a certain extent on the stabilization of the economies of the former soviet union  the ability to maintain the necessary telecommunications licenses and the ability to obtain adequate financing to meet capital commitments 
effect of change from canadian gaap to us gaap 
the effect of the restatement of prior year comparatives from canada to us gaap is explained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
however  the main differences may be summarized as follows i under canadian gaap  the convertible notes issued in connection with the june placement are a compound financial instrument and the debt and equity elements are separately accounted for 
under us gaap  the convertible notes are accounted for as a single debt instrument under the long term debt caption  and ii us gaap does not permit the capitalization of pre operating costs 
therefore  in anticipation of the change to us gaap  effective december  the company changed its canadian gaap policy with respect to pre operating costs to be in accordance with us gaap 
as a result  all such costs were retroactively expensed 
accounting standards 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  reporting comprehensive income  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information  were issued in june sfas establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
this statement requires that all items that are required to be recognized under accounting standards as components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements 
the company has not determined the impact of sfas on its financial statements 
sfas establishes standards for the way public companies report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that those companies report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports issued to shareholders 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
the company is required to adopt both new standards in the first quarter of management fees 
certain of the company s subsidiaries pay management fees to their shareholders  including the company 
the figures presented for the subsidiaries reflect all payments of such fees ie  management fees are included in operating expenses in the same way as other expenses of the subsidiary 
profitability measures ebitda  operating profit and net income are therefore quoted after accounting for such payments

corporate in connection with the continuance of the company from ontario to delaware  the company closed its executive offices in toronto  canada on february  and subsequently established executive offices in new york  usa in the second quarter of at the same time the company reduced substantially the activities carried out by its wholly owned subsidiary  pldms  from its offices in london  england

working capital and other balance sheet items at december   the company had a working capital deficit not including funds held in escrow of million compared to a working capital surplus of million at december  the reduction in working capital was primarily the result of the company s acquisition of the additional interest in technocom for gross consideration of million 
the acquisition  which increased the company s ownership in technocom to  was financed with million series a senior secured revolving credit notes  million series b senior revolving credit notes  both due in  a million draw from escrow of the proceeds of the senior notes originally issued in june and the issuance of  shares of common stock from treasury 
the company placed privately a total of million in senior and convertible notes in june the proceeds  which amounted to million net of discounts  commissions and expenses  were used to pay off the company s million bank facility and to meet the company s then outstanding million commitment to technocom  with the remainder being targeted for capital investments in the existing operating units  the development of additional products and services to be delivered over the company s networks  and general corporate purposes 
funds targeted for capital investment or new products and services were required to be held in escrow 
the senior notes mature on june  with interest accreted at a rate of per annum  compounding semi annually  to an aggregate principal amount of million by december  cash interest does not accrue on the senior notes prior to december  thereafter  interest will accrue at the rate of per annum and will be payable in cash  semi annually  on june and december of each year  commencing june  the convertible notes  with a face value of million  mature on june  with interest accruing at the rate of per annum  payable in cash  semi annually  on june and december of each year 
at december   the funds being held in escrow  which are not included in current assets  totaled million compared to million at the end of the company s ability to access these funds freely is restricted since the funds in escrow can only be accessed after compliance with a number of conditions  including ensuring that the funds are only used for certain designated purposes and that certain other safeguards are in place 
the company believes that the funds in escrow should be sufficient to implement the business plans of its operating subsidiaries at least through the indentures governing the release of the escrow funds have recently been amended to broaden the range of transactions for which the company may use the escrow funds to make telecommunications assets available to its operating subsidiaries 
it is anticipated that million will be released from escrow shortly 
the indentures have also been amended to revise certain covenants relating to corporate indebtedness  the guarantee of subsidiary debt  and the establishment of us special purpose subsidiaries 
under the terms of the company s senior notes  the company is required to raise million in a common share financing by may  should the company not complete such an offering by may   the annual interest rate on the senior notes will automatically increase to until such time as an offering in completed 
the obligation to raise million in equity is also a requirement under the terms of the series a and b senior revolving credit notes issued in november should the company not raise million in equity prior to may   the interest rate on the series a and b notes will increase to per annum for the period commencing on june  until maturity 
interest on both the series a and b notes is payable monthly in arrears 
the series a notes mature on december  and the series b notes mature on september  the company is also required  under the terms of the revolving credit notes  to reduce the aggregate commitments of the notes by million on july  and on the last day of each succeeding month 
in connection with the issuance of the series a and b notes  the company issued warrants to purchase a total of  shares of its common stock 
in addition  the company will be obligated to issue additional warrants to the holders of the series a and b notes should the company not effect certain targeted reductions in commitment as follows commitment reduction date targeted reduction amount july   august   september   october   november   the holders of the series a notes will receive  additional warrants to purchase shares of the company on each date on which such reduction was not made 
in the event that the company has not made the targeted reductions scheduled for july  and august   the holders of the series b notes will receive  additional warrants to purchase shares of such common stock 
the exercise price of the above warrants is per share  except that  if the series b notes are not repaid in full by september   the exercise price of all warrants issued to the holders of the series b notes becomes per share  and  if the series a notes are not repaid in full by december   the exercise price of all warrants issued to the holders of the series a notes also becomes 
the total number of warrants which could be issued under these arrangements is  all of the warrants expire on december  in addition  if the series b notes are not repaid in full on september   then  commencing september  and on the last day of each succeeding month until the series b notes have been repaid in full  the holders of the series b notes shall receive  additional warrants to purchase shares of the company s stock at a price of per share

shareholders equity of million at december  compared with million at the end of and consisted of million in common stock and additional paid in capital  offset by the company s deficit of million 
capital stock increased during the year as a result of the issuance of  common shares  at an effective price of per share  as part consideration in respect of the company s acquisition of the additional interest in technocom and the exercise throughout the year of  share options and warrants at prices ranging between c and us 
the company s ratio of long term indebtedness to equity at december  was compared with at december  to the extent that i actual cash flows from operations are below the company s estimates as a result of lower than expected revenues per line or higher operating costs  or ii development costs of the build out of the peterstar  becet and technocom teleport tp networks exceed current estimates  the company may be required to seek additional debt or equity financing beyond that required above 
year issue the year issue exists because many computer systems and applications  particularly older systems and applications  use a two digit  rather than a four digit  date field to designate a particular year 
as a result  with the century change  date sensitive systems may recognize dates in the twenty first century ie  after as dates in the twentieth century ie  the corresponding year commencing with the prefix 
equally  such systems may not recognize dates in the twenty first century at all 
all of this could lead to system failures or miscalculations which could lead to disruption of operations such as data being lost  an inability to process transactions  incorrect data being generated and critical deadlines being overlooked 
the impact of these disruptions could be significant 
the company has addressed the year issue in the following ways 
first  the company has contacted  and has required all of its operating businesses to contact the manufacturers of equipment and producers of software which they use in their businesses or review websites or other materials published by such parties relating to such equipment or software 
such survey has indicated that  except in a few instances  all such equipment and software is year compliant 
where possible  steps are being taken to upgrade or replace equipment which is not year compliant 
while there can be no assurance that disruptions will not occur  the company believes  based on this survey and the fact that much of the equipment and software on which its businesses are for the most part of recent vintage  that it should not encounter material problems in this particular area 
while it does not appear that any of the parties from whom the company or any of its operating businesses have obtained goods or services in the past have provided specific undertakings regarding year compliance  and there is some doubt whether existing warranties or other undertakings will in fact be construed to cover year compliance  starting in january  all operating businesses are also being required to use their best efforts to obtain specific warranties of year compliance from parties with which they contract for products or services thereafter 
additionally  such operating businesses have been required to review the terms under which they have heretofore supplied products and or services to third parties 
no case has been identified in which any operating business has specifically guaranteed year compliance  and the company has instituted a policy regarding the giving of such guarantees in the future in order to control and limit possible exposure thereunder 
further  since none of the operating businesses manufacture equipment or produce proprietary software for customers other than in exceptional cases  virtually all such transactions involve the re sale or assignment of products and services supplied by others 
accordingly  the company believes that  to the extent that such products and services are either warranted or shown to be year compliant  its own exposure is commensurately reduced 
the company has investigated the possibility of obtaining insurance against liability arising out of claims that products or services supplied are not year compliant  but has determined that such insurance is not obtainable upon terms which are sufficiently comprehensive and or is only obtainable upon terms which are uneconomical given the level of perceived risk  and accordingly has elected not to pursue such insurance 
based on all of the foregoing  the company believes that it does not have any material exposure to claims that the products or services it supplies are not year compliant  that the cost of ensuring that equipment and software used in its operations and the operations of its operating businesses is likely to be immaterial  and that the possible disruptions to all such operations arising from year problems is likely to be relatively minimal 
taxation the company and its subsidiaries are subject to a number of taxes in different jurisdictions 
the most significant taxes affecting the company and its subsidiaries are likely to be taxes in russia and kazakhstan including withholding taxes and income taxes payable by the company in the united states 
withholding taxes could apply to distributions by the company s operating businesses in russia and kazakhstan and to distributions by intermediate level companies in jurisdictions outside russia  kazakhstan  canada and the united states 
the company has attempted to mitigate the potential for withholding tax liabilities by structuring its interests through a cypriot holding company  thereby taking advantage of the double taxation treaty between the russian federation and cyprus 
as a result of the continuance and its ability to take advantage of the double taxation treaties between the united states and the russian federation and kazakhstan  respectively  the company may elect to hold its interests through one or more delaware holding companies 
notwithstanding this  obtaining the benefits of applicable tax treaties can be extremely difficult due to the documentary and other requirements imposed by the russian and kazakh authorities 
for example  the kazakh tax authorities require that an exemption application be submitted in respect of every payment made  while at the same time requiring non standard certifications from the home country taxing authority 
in addition  a recent instruction issued by the russian state tax service mandates full withholding regardless of any treaty and requires the recipient to seek to obtain a refund for withholding in excess of treaty amounts 
the need to comply with these provisions may negate or impair tax planning initiatives undertaken by the company to reduce its and its subsidiaries overall tax obligations 
in general  the company s russian and kazakh operating businesses are faced with a wide variety of taxes  including property taxes  advertising taxes  road taxes  housing taxes  transport taxes and education taxes 
in addition  peterstar  technocom and becet are subject to corporate profits taxes of  and  respectively 
the tax systems in russia and kazakhstan have changed rapidly in recent years and may undergo additional changes  which may have a material adverse effect on the company 
technocom established a representative office in moscow in october and registered this office with the relevant russian tax authorities 
this resulted in technocom becoming subject to profits and other russian taxes as of such date 
inasmuch as technocom operated to some extent in the russian federation prior to this date  without clarifying its tax status with any russian taxing authority  it is also possible that tax officials may take the position that technocom may be subject to vat and or profits and other russian taxes with respect to the period before october at december   the company had operating loss carryforwards for us federal income tax purposes of approximately million 
in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable future income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning in making these assessments 
at december   the company had operating loss carryforwards for canadian income tax purposes of approximately million and allowable capital loss carryforwards of approximately million 
upon the company s emigration to the united states in february  these losses do not carryover for us tax purposes 
currency controls the russian federation exchange controls 
the russian federation currently has in place relatively liberal policies regarding hard currency transfers by russian residents to non residents 
payments in us dollars may generally be made freely between russian residents which generally includes all russian companies and citizens resident in russia and non residents which generally includes non russian companies even if they have a representative office or other permanent establishment in russia for current currency transactions generally those where payment is made within days of the provision of goods and services 
payments in us dollars classified as movements of capital which generally includes direct investments  portfolio investments  acquisition of real estate and payments made pursuant to loan  lease  sale of goods and services agreements having terms of over days are subject to licensing by the central bank 
while peterstar believes that it has applied for all the necessary licenses  not all licenses have been received 
failure to apply for the appropriate licenses  or to receive the outstanding licenses could result in fines and penalties 
additionally  delays in the receipt of licenses will also delay the time at which the company can start to realize cashflows from the leasing of assets to its operating subsidiaries in russia

payments between russian residents must generally be made in roubles 
russian companies may exchange roubles for us dollars if they can document us dollar denominated liabilities that are due and payable within specified periods 
russian companies are required to convert of most hard currency earnings into roubles  but as noted in the preceding sentence may be able to reconvert such amounts into hard currency if they can document hard currency denominated liabilities that are due and payable within a specified period 
roubles may not be lawfully exported from  or converted into  other currencies outside of russia 
availability of hard currency for conversion purposes 
the ability of foreign investors to convert roubles into hard currency is also subject to the availability of hard currency in the russian currency markets 
although there is an existing market within russia for the conversion of roubles into other currencies  including the interbank currency exchange  over the counter and currency futures markets  the development of this market is uncertain 
exchange rates 
significant fluctuations in the value of the rouble against the us dollar and other hard currencies can also have a material impact on the value of a foreign investor s rouble dividend income or rouble proceeds from the sale of rouble denominated securities 
in recent years  the rouble has experienced a significant depreciation relative to the us dollar and other hard currencies  although during and it achieved relative stability vis a vis the us dollar and other hard currencies 
repatriation 
although russian law governing foreign investment guarantees foreign investors the right to repatriate their earnings from russian investments  the russian exchange control regime  including licensing requirements administered by the central bank  may materially affect their ability to do so and may increase the cost of such repatriation 
see business risk factors risks involving the company currency controls  restrictions on repatriation of payments  prior investments 
kazakhstan exchange controls 
kazakhstan currently has in place relatively liberal policies governing hard currency transfers by kazakh residents to non residents 
residents which generally includes all kazakh companies and citizens resident in kazakhstan can use hard currency to pay non residents which generally includes all non kazakh companies and their branch offices and representative offices in kazakhstan for current currency transactions generally those where payment is made within days of the provision of goods or services 
payments in us dollars classified as movements of capital which generally includes direct investments  portfolio investments  payments with respect to real estate and payments made after days for goods and services are subject to licensing by the national bank of kazakhstan 
payments between kazakh residents must generally be made in tenge 
kazakh companies may exchange tenge for us dollars if they can document us dollar denominated liabilities that are due and payable within specified periods 
the national bank of kazakhstan does not currently require the conversion of hard currency earnings into tenge 
tenge may not be lawfully exported from kazakhstan or converted into other currencies outside of kazakhstan 
availability of hard currency for conversion purposes 
the ability of foreign investors to convert tenge into hard currency is also subject to the availability of hard currency in the kazakh currency markets 
although there is an existing market within kazakhstan for the conversion of tenge into other currencies  including the interbank currency exchange and the over the counter markets  the development of this market is uncertain 
exchange rates 
significant fluctuations in the value of the tenge against the us dollar and other hard currencies can also have a material impact on the value of a foreign investor s tenge dividend income or tenge proceeds for the sale of tenge denominated securities 
since january  the tenge has experienced relative stability against the us dollar and other hard currencies 
repatriation 
kazakhstan s foreign investment legislation provides that earnings from investments made by foreign investors may be freely repatriated provided that all applicable fees and taxes have been paid 
however  the exchange control regime in kazakhstan may materially affect an investor s ability to do so and may increase the cost of such repatriation

inflation since the break up of the soviet union  both the russian and kazakh economies have been characterized by high rates of inflation 
although in and  inflation in both countries decreased substantially  there is no assurance that these trends will continue 
in recent years  the devaluation of the rouble and tenge has not kept pace with inflation 
to the extent that the company s costs are denominated in the rouble or the tenge and devaluation of these currencies does not fully offset inflation  the company s local currency costs will increase in hard currency terms 
if the company s operating businesses are unable to increase prices in line with inflation  due to competitive pressures or otherwise  the results of operations of the company s operating businesses may be adversely affected
