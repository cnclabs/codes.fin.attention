the company relies on payments from general textiles and factory u to service the required principal  interest and dividend payments related to its debt and preferred stock and to pay operating costs and expenses 
such payments from general textiles include payments to the company pursuant to a tax sharing agreement defined below  debt service arising from certain subordinated debt of general textiles which the company owns pursuant to purchases from third parties  and a management agreement the gt management agreement  as described below 
general textiles filed as part of its bankruptcy proceedings a plan of reorganization the reorganization plan 
the us bankruptcy court confirmed it april  debt securities issued under the reorganization plan prohibit the payment of dividends and other distributions by general textiles to the company 
payments by factory u to the company are limited under the factory u revolving credit facility to payments pursuant to a management agreement the factory u management agreement and a debt guaranty agreement the guaranty fee agreement 
pursuant to the reorganization plan  the company and general textiles entered into the tax sharing agreement the tax sharing agreement 
the tax sharing agreement requires general textiles to pay to the company or to its affiliates  an amount equal to of any federal income tax savings achieved by general textiles sharing in net tax losses arising from general textiles filing its federal income tax return on a consolidated basis with the company and its affiliates as opposed to filing a federal income tax return on an unconsolidated stand alone basis 
likewise  the tax sharing agreement also requires the company to pay to general textiles of any federal income tax savings accruing to the company that arise from the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return 
payments or accruals to the company or general textiles under the tax sharing agreement are made annually based on the estimated tax savings  if any 
the payments or accruals under the tax sharing agreement are intercompany transactions that are eliminated in consolidation  and have no effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations 
at january   the company has significant net operating loss carryforwards nols that may benefit general textiles in future periods and result in general textiles being required to make payments to the company under the tax sharing agreement 
general textiles experienced a tax loss for federal purposes in fiscal and therefore did not benefit from the company s nols 
furthermore  a significant portion of the company s nols are of limited use in the future because of section of the internal revenue code  which limits the offsetting of nols against current taxable income following a change in control 
therefore  to the degree that general textiles experiences tax losses in the future or has its own nols available to offset future taxable income  or to the degree there are limits on the availability of the company s nols to offset future taxable income of general textiles  payments to the company pursuant to the tax sharing agreement may be significantly limited 
at january   the company owned an aggregate of million face amount of general textiles subordinated notes acquired from third party note holders in fiscal and general textiles makes payments to the company in accordance with the terms of the notes and the reorganization plan as described below 
the debt securities issued under the reorganization plan permit the payment of management fees and bonuses by general textiles to the company pursuant to the gt management agreement 
obligations for payments by general textiles under the gt management agreement are subordinated to general textiles obligations under its revolving credit facility 
management believes that the company s sources of cash  including the cash received under the tax sharing agreement  the trade subordinated notes defined below  the company subordinated note defined below  the gt management agreement  the fu management agreement  and the guaranty fee agreement will be adequate to finance its operations and meet obligations under its existing indebtedness as they become due for at least the next twelve months 
the ability of the company to make dividend payments on the series a preferred stock as they come due will be dependent on the results of operations of the company 
obligations of the company 
as of january   the company  exclusive of general textiles and factory u  had outstanding indebtedness in the principal amount of million 
the november acquisition of factory u was completed pursuant to a stock purchase agreement between the company and the former shareholders of factory u 
the acquisition was financed in part by the issuance of certain notes payable 
at january   the company was obligated pursuant to two promissory notes a million term note with principal and accrued interest due in october and a million installment note with principal and interest payable in quarterly installments until october collectively  the fu acquisition notes 
the fu acquisition notes bear interest at a rate of per annum and are subject to penalties and adjustment in the event of failure to pay amounts when due 
in january  the company settled a lawsuit commenced in by former owners of mandel kahn industries  inc which was purchased by the company in under the settlement  the company paid million and entered into a five year consulting agreement requiring an aggregate of million in cash payments and issuance of  shares of series a preferred stock 
the company remains obligated at january  to pay an aggregate of million in monthly installments until january series a preferred stock 
dividends on the series a preferred stock total million per year based on the annual dividend rate of per share and are payable quarterly if  as  and when declared by the board of directors 
private placements of series b preferred stock 
on february  and march   the company issued  and  additional shares  respectively  of its series b junior convertible  exchangeable preferred stock the series b preferred stock for aggregate proceeds of million 
then  on march  and june   the company issued  and shares  respectively  of series b preferred stock to certain members of management in return for million in full recourse notes collateralized by the stock 
the series b preferred stock has an increasing rate dividend 
accordingly  dividends on series b preferred stock are recorded using the effective interest method to recognize the dividends ratably over the estimated period in which the stock will be outstanding 
although dividends are recorded for financial statement purposes  the series b preferred stock pays no cash dividends  except under certain events of liquidity  until there is no longer any series a preferred stock outstanding 
the net proceeds obtained from the private placements were used by the company to pay the costs to settle the existing employment and benefit agreements of the former executives and to reduce outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facilities defined below

credit terms provided by vendors and other suppliers are usually net days

upon and after emerging from bankruptcy in may  general textiles issued non interest bearing subordinated notes and reorganization securities collectively  the bankruptcy debt in satisfaction of the claims of its creditors 
payments to holders of the bankruptcy debt are contingent upon the annual earnings and cash flow levels of general textiles 
interest expense and carrying value of the bankruptcy debt is determined based on projections of the earnings and cash flows of general textiles  which in turn impact the projected amounts and timing of payments to be made on debt principal 
due to the contingent nature of the timing and amounts of future payments  the carrying value and annual interest expense related to the bankruptcy debt can be significantly impacted by changes in expected earnings and cash flows of general textiles 
likewise  actual earnings and cash flows  as well as minimum payment provisions of the reorganization plan and the related notes  can result in substantial principal payment requirements in future years 
the inability of general textiles to make such payments can result in additional issuance of debt or  ultimately  in the loss of control of general textiles  as described more completely below 
management believes that general textiles will have sufficient resources to provide for capital expenditures  to finance its working capital needs and to make expected payments required under the bankruptcy debt and other debt during the next twelve months from credit supplied by the company  its suppliers  its working capital facility and internally generated cash flow

if general textiles failed to pay at least of the original principal amount of the trade subordinated notes by days after determination of its excess cash flow for fiscal  it would be required to issue additional subordinated notes equal to of those which had originally been issued 
however  sufficient principal payments have been made to avoid this requirement

these services include merchandising  finance  accounting  distribution  advertising and executive administrative support 
general textiles also serves as the purchasing agent for all merchandise shipped to factory u 
factory u generally pays general textiles for merchandise purchased by general textiles within days of receipt of goods by general textiles

inflation in general  the company believes that inflation has had no recent material impact on operations and none is anticipated in the next fiscal year 
minimum wage increases and welfare reform the company employs  both in its stores and in its corporate headquarters  a substantial number of employees who earn hourly wages near or at the minimum wage 
actions by both the federal and certain state governments have increased the hourly wages payable by the company to such employees 
to mitigate the impact of this wage increase  the company has instituted policies to maintain its ratio of wages to gross margins by controlling aggregate wage increases through an enhanced wage control and monitoring system and increased initial mark ons to its retail prices 
management believes that these measures will be adequate to control the impact of hourly wage increases on the overall profitability of its operations 
a significant number of the company s customers are believed to come from low income families whose incomes have historically been subsidized by government and other forms of assistance 
management believes that action by the federal and certain state governments to reform income subsidies may have an impact on its operating performance 
however  management also believes it is too early to tell whether the impact will be materially adverse to the company 
although management expects demand for off price apparel and low priced home goods to continue to grow in the markets its serves despite governmental reforms  management recognizes that there can be no assurance that demand will grow at all or as fast as it has historically 
the company has made substantial investments and financial commitments towards serving low income customers  and any adverse impact on the income of such customers may adversely impact the operating results of the company 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations the company historically has realized its highest level of sales and income during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year the quarters ending in october and january as a result of the back to school august and september and christmas november and december seasons 
if the company s sales were substantially below seasonal expectations during the third and fourth quarters  the company s annual results would be adversely affected 
the company historically has realized lower sales in its first two quarters february through july  which often has resulted in the company incurring losses during those quarters 
the company incurred a net loss and net losses applicable to common stock in both of the first two quarters of fiscal based on these historical results  management believes that it may  during the first two quarters of fiscal  experience operating results that are substantially below those expected for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year issue the company uses various computer programs that would fail to perform accurately if not replaced before the year affects any transactions 
the company has reviewed new integrated software packages to support future growth and which are capable of addressing the issues associated with the year as part of its capital expenditure plans previously discussed  the company plans to install new software commencing in at a cost of approximately million to million and does not anticipate that conversion issues will materially influence operations or operating results 
cautionary statement for purposes of safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of certain statements contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that are not related to historical results are forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from those projected or implied in the forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which are more fully described in part i  item of this form k
