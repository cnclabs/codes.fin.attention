contributing to the increase were strong market share gains for an insecticide for which the company is the exclusive north american distributor 
north american compost nutritional supplement sales were reduced slightly as the company introduced its proprietary supplement product in extensive field trials and product sampling programs had the short term effect of displacing existing sales
