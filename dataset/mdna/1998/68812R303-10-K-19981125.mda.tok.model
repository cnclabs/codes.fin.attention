item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is a leader in the field of genomics based drug targets discovery the identification and functional characterization of genes 
the company has over ten years of experience in the field of genomics  having served as one of the primary researchers under genome programs sponsored by the united states government  and has developed numerous techniques and tools that are widely used in the field 
the company s commercial gene discovery strategy capitalizes on its pioneering work in genomics by applying its high throughput sequencing technology and positional cloning  its experience and skills in functional genomics and its bioinformatics capabilities 
the two areas of focus are the discovery and characterization of i genes of pathogens that are responsible for many serious diseases and ii human disease genes 
the company believes that its genomic discoveries may lead to the development of novel therapeutics  vaccines and diagnostic products by it and its strategic partners 
the company has entered into numerous corporate collaborations in connection with its pathogen and human gene discovery programs 
the company does not anticipate revenues on a sustained basis until such time that therapeutic  vaccine and diagnostic products based on the company s research efforts are commercialized  if at all 
the company s product development strategy is to form collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies accessing drug discovery and clinical development capabilities that currently do not exist at the company 
in the pharmaceutical alliances  the company generates revenues from licensing fees  sponsored research and milestone payments during the term of the collaboration 
once a product resulting from the research collaboration is commercialized  the company is entitled to receive royalty payments based upon product revenues 
additionally  the company will sell non exclusive access to its proprietary pathogenome tm database 
these collaborations are expected to result in the discovery and commercialization of novel therapeutics  vaccines and diagnostics 
the sale of the genetic database generates subscription revenue over the term of the subscription and royalty payments to the company from product sales downstream 
in order for a product to be commercialized based on the company s research  it will be necessary for the collaborators to conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  obtain regulatory clearances and make manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements 
accordingly  the company does not expect to receive royalties based upon product revenues for many years 
the company s primary sources of revenue are collaborative agreements with pharmaceutical company partners  subscription agreements to the company s proprietary pathogenome tm database and government research grants and contracts

under these agreements  the subscribers will receive non exclusive access to the company s pathogenome tm database and associated information relating to microbial organisms 
since  the company has been awarded a number of research grants and contracts by various agencies of the united states government pursuant to the government genomics programs 
the scope of the research covered by grants and contracts encompasses technology development  sequencing production  technology automation projects and positional cloning projects 
these programs strengthened the company s genomics technology base and increased the number and enhanced the expertise of its scientific personnel 
from january through august  the united states government awarded the company grants and contracts providing for the aggregate payments over their terms of approximately million 
however  over the last two years  the company has substantially reduced its reliance on government research grants and contracts as the company focuses its resources more toward drug discovery in collaboration with pharmaceutical partners 
the company has incurred significant losses  since inception  with an accumulated deficit of approximately  at august  the company s results of operations have fluctuated from period to period and may continue to fluctuate in the future based upon the timing and composition of funding under existing and new collaborative agreements and government research grants and contracts

see note to consolidated financial statements 
many currently installed computer systems and software applications are designed to accept only two digit entries in the date code field used to identify years 
these date code fields require modification to recognize twenty first century years 
as a result  computer systems and software applications used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with the year requirements 
significant uncertainty exists concerning the potential effects of failure to comply with such requirements 
the company is currently performing an extensive review of its computer systems  software applications  and genomic database storage and retrieval systems used both internally and sold to its customers to identify which systems may be impacted by year the company plans to develop a comprehensive compliance program  using internal and  if necessary  external resources to address year issues 
the program would include an evaluation of its internally developed operating systems and internally used financial and administration systems 
externally  the program will include soliciting and obtaining compliance certificates from third party software vendors as well as determining the readiness of its major suppliers 
at this time  given that the company s internal financial and administrative systems have been installed within the last few years and the internally developed software based systems are not generally date sensitive  the company does not expect the cost of addressing the year issue to have a material impact on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
if such modifications  conversions  and or replacements are not completed in a timely manner  or if any of the company s suppliers or customers do not successfully deal with the year issue  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company s research and development efforts could be significantly interrupted resulting in delays in meeting its scientific obligations to existing collaborations  delays in progress of its internal drug discovery programs and  consequently  delays in attracting new collaborative partners 
after evaluating its internal compliance efforts as well as the compliance effort of third parties with which the company does business  the company will develop appropriate contingency plans in fiscal to address situations in which various systems of the company  or of third parties are not yet year compliant 
if there are unidentified dependencies on systems to operate the business or  if any required modifications are not completed on a timely basis or are more costly to implement than anticipated  the company s business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially affected 
statements in this form k that are not strictly historical are forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of the actual results may differ from those projected in the forward looking statement due to risks and uncertainties that exist in the company s operations and business environment
