item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company develops  manufactures and globally distributes medical devices used in minimally invasive ophthalmic surgery 
the company s primary products are its foldable iols  its glaucoma wick tm  its icls tm and its staarvisc tm viscoelastic solution 
the company markets its principal products  its iols  both domestically and in numerous foreign countries 
iol sales accounted for of the company s domestic revenues and of the company s international revenues in  respectively 
the company markets the glaucoma wick tm  which the company introduced in late  and its icls tm and staarvisc tm viscoelastic solution  which the company introduced in late  in selected foreign countries 
the company has marketed its foldable iols internationally since and  in september  following a lengthy period of clinical studies  received fda pre market approval to fully market the company s elastimide tm and elastic tm foldable iol models within the united states 
since that time  the company s total revenues increased from million in its fiscal year to million in its fiscal year  representing a compound annual growth rate of 
the company also receives royalty income with respect to certain of its licensed technologies  although it does not consider the royalty income to be material to its prospective financial condition 
international revenues represented of total revenues for the fiscal year  up from for the fiscal year 
the mix of the company s revenues and profits  on both a product and geographic basis  will be affected by the continued introduction and acceptance of the company s glaucoma wick tm  icls tm and staarvisc tm viscoelastic solution in various markets worldwide  including the united states 
sales of the company s glaucoma wick tm and icls tm will be limited to international markets until such products receive united states fda pre market approval 
the company s objective is to increase international revenues to account for one half of total revenue 
the company s principal customers are ophthalmologists  ambulatory surgical centers  hospitals  managed care providers  health maintenance organizations and group purchasing organizations 
the company generally supplies a quantity of foldable iols with different specifications to customers on a consignment basis and recognizes sales when an ophthalmic surgeon implants the consigned foldable iol 
sales to distributors are generally recognized upon shipment 
the company typically does not have any backlog of orders for its products 
the company s customers for foldable iols are generally eligible to receive reimbursements from government or private third party payors  such as medicare  subject to certain limitations and pricing pressures 
the company does not expect that icls tm will be eligible for  and there can be no assurance that the glaucoma wick tm will be eligible for  reimbursement by government or private third party payors 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues represented by certain items reflected in the company s income statement for the period indicated and the percentage increase or decrease in such items over the prior period

total costs and expenses operating income other income expense  net income before income taxes 
income tax provision bene fit net income fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
revenues for the year ended january  were million  representing a increase over million in revenues for the prior year ended january  the increase in revenues was principally attributable to i an increase in royalty payments  primarily due to a payment by a licensee of past royalties  and ii increased sales of the company s new products and increased international sales of the company s iols  partially offset by domestic and international price decreases 
royalty revenues increased from million to million 
revenues from the sale of the company s new products  principally its icls tm  glaucoma wick tm and new iol products including the toric tm iol  increased to million in fiscal from  in fiscal international sales of iols in fiscal increased by in unit volume  and by million in dollar terms  over the prior fiscal year 
total international sales increased to of total sales for the fiscal year  as compared to of total sales for the prior fiscal year  reflecting the company s ongoing efforts to develop international markets as well as the conversion of these markets to foldable iols 
increases in sales of iols in unit volume were partially offset by an average price decrease for iols of nearly  as a result of competitive pressures  both domestically and internationally 
management anticipates that international sales revenues will continue to increase at a rate significantly greater than domestic sales  reflecting i the company s increased efforts to broaden its international distribution channels and to promote its products internationally  ii increased iol unit volumes due to the continued conversion of international iol markets to foldable iols  and iii greater international awareness and acceptance of the company s icls tm and glaucoma wick tm  particularly as ophthalmologists continue to receive the surgical training required to implant these ocular products  and the company continues to proceed with its united states clinical studies 
management also believes that it will continue to benefit from volume increases attributable to the continuing conversion of the domestic cataract market to foldable iols  albeit at a slower rate of increase due to the higher rate of conversion to date of the domestic market to foldable iols 
management believes that the prices of iols will continue to be affected by competition 
cost of sales 
due primarily to additional royalty income and also continued manufacturing efficiencies  cost of sales as a percentage of revenues for the year ended january  declined to of revenues as compared to for the prior fiscal year 
this reduction was effectuated notwithstanding price decreases resulting from competitive pressures and a product mix change due to an increased demand for the elastimide tm iol which is relatively more expensive to manufacture than the elastic tm model 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense for the year ended january  was million  or of revenues  as compared to million  or or revenues  for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in general and administrative expense  both in dollar terms and as a percentage of revenues  was attributable to additional administrative infrastructure expenditures required to support the increase in revenues and costs related to investors relations 
marketing and selling 
marketing and selling expense for the year ended january  was million  or of revenues  as compared to million  or of revenues  for the prior fiscal year 
the decline in marketing and selling expense as a percentage of revenues was attributable to the significant growth in overall revenues permitting greater absorption of fixed marketing and selling ie non commission costs 
the increase in marketing and selling expense in dollar terms was principally attributable to additional selling and marketing expenses arising from the operations of the company s new european distribution subsidiaries 
research and development 
research and development expense for the year ended january  was million  or of revenues  as compared to million  or of revenues  for the prior fiscal year 
these expenditures were attributable to the company s continued investment in developing new products  manufacturing and distribution systems  cost reduction projects for manufacturing and increased costs incurred conducting clinical studies in the united states 
other expense or income  net 
other expense for the year ended january  was  or of revenues  as compared other income of  or of revenues  for the prior fiscal year 
the primary reasons for the overall increase in other expenses over income were increased interest expenses  and losses in translating foreign currency 
income tax provision 
income taxes increased to a provision of million for the year ended january   as compared to a provision of million for the prior fiscal year 
the company s tax rate increased from a rate of in fiscal to a rate of for fiscal  primarily due to a greater percentage of income before taxes being subject to taxation at the higher united states combined federal and state marginal tax rate 
during fiscal the company utilized all of its remaining tax operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the company s positive operating results for each of the three years ended january  the company determined that deferred tax assets of million and million should be recognized as of january  and january  these amounts were based on a consideration of current and future anticipated earnings 
future income levels should result and in full recognition of the deferred tax assets 
the amount recorded as of january  includes the capitalization of the remaining balance of the company net operating loss carryforwards 
management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized in full 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
revenues for the year ended january  were million  representing a increase over million in revenues for the prior year ended december  the increase in revenues was principally attributable to the continued growth in unit sales of the company s primary products  its foldable iols  in both the domestic and international markets  partially offset by certain domestic price decreases due to competitive pressures 
increases in unit volume are attributable  in significant part  to the continuing conversion of the cataract market to foldable iols 
revenues from international sales increased to of total revenues for the year ended january   as compared to for the prior fiscal year  reflecting the company s increased efforts to develop international markets  as well as the conversion of these markets to foldable iols 
also included in revenues for the year ended january  are international sales of  resulting from the commercial introduction in selected foreign markets of the company s glaucoma wick tm at the end of and its icls tm and staarvisc tm viscoelastic solution at the end of fiscal revenues from royalties also increased from  for to million for fiscal cost of sales 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenues for the year ended january  declined slightly to of revenues as compared for the prior fiscal year 
the principal reasons for this slight decline were increased operating efficiencies and economies of scale from increased sales volume 
these savings were offset by price decreases resulting from competitive pressures and a product mix change due to an increased demand for the elastimide tm iol  which is relatively more expensive to manufacture 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense for the year ended january  was million  or of revenues  as compared to million  or or revenues  for the prior fiscal year 
the decline in general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues was attributable to the significant growth in overall revenues permitting greater absorption of general and administrative costs

marketing and selling 
marketing and selling expense for the year ended january  was million  or of revenues  as compared to million  or of revenues  for the prior fiscal year 
the decline in marketing and selling expense as a percentage of revenues was attributable to the significant growth in overall revenues permitting greater absorption of fixed marketing and selling ie  non commission costs

research and development 
research and development expense for the year ended january  was million  or of revenues  as compared to million  or of revenues  for the prior fiscal year 
this increase was attributable to the company s continued investment in developing new products  manufacturing systems and distribution systems  cost reduction projects for manufacturing  and increased costs incurred conducting clinical studies in the united states 
other income  net 
other income for the year ended january  was  or of revenues  as compared to  or of revenues  for the prior fiscal year 
the primary reasons for this decrease were increased interest expenses  losses in translating foreign currency  and a decline in deferred revenue arising from the sale of a license to the canon staar joint venture 
the deferred revenue reported in fiscal is the last portion of total deferred revenue realized with respect to the canon staar license 
income tax provision 
income taxes increased to a provision of million for the year ended january  from a benefit of  for the prior fiscal year 
fiscal is the first year the company has reported an income tax provision without having offsets related to net operating loss carryforwards 
however  the company will not pay any significant federal income taxes until it fully utilizes the remaining million of net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes 
the company fully utilized its net operating loss carryforwards for state taxes in the company has recorded a deferred tax asset of million as of january  liquidity and capital resources the company has funded its activities over the past several years principally from cash flow generated from operations  credit facilities provided by institutional domestic and foreign lenders  and the exercise of stock options and warrants 
the company s principal domestic credit facility is a line of credit originally entered into on a secured basis in june  and refinanced on an unsecured basis in june  which currently allows the company to borrow up to million on a revolving basis  at a rate of interest not to exceed the prime interest rate  less or  at the election of the company  if more than  is outstanding  at a rate of interest equal to libor  plus 
this line of credit expires in june the underlying loan agreement requires the company to satisfy certain financial tests  and limits the amount of indebtedness the company may incur to others 
the refinance of the line of credit in june resulted in a reclassification of debt from short term to long term 
borrowings outstanding under this line of credit as of january  were approximately million 
in november  the company s domestic lender supplemented the company s domestic credit facility by committing through march  to make additional advances to the company of up to million for business acquisitions 
any principal amounts borrowed pursuant to this commitment would be repaid in monthly installments of principal of  until such amounts were repaid 
interest on any such principal amounts borrowed will be payable monthly at a rate of interest not to exceed the prime interest rate  less or  at the election of the company  if more than  is outstanding  at a rate of interest equal to libor  plus 
the underlying loan agreement requires the company to satisfy certain financial tests  and limits the amount of indebtedness the company may incur to others 
no borrowings under this commitment have been made as of january  the company s foreign credit facility consists of a separate revolving line of credit and a term loan extended in may by a swiss bank to the company s subsidiary  staar surgical ag 
the revolving line of credit facility provides for borrowings up to  million swiss francs at a rate of interest as of january  a commission rate of is payable each quarter 
the line of credit does not have a termination date and is secured by a general assignment of claims 
borrowings outstanding as of january  under the line of credit were approximately  which balance exceeded the maximum allowable borrowings 
the excess borrowings were permitted by the lender due to adequate compensating cash balances 
under the term loan  staar surgical ag obtained a  million swiss francs loan guaranteed partially by the swiss government and partially by the company 
interest on this loan is  which the company shares on an equal basis with the bank and the swiss government 
the principal amount of this loan is required to be repaid in four equal annual installments  beginning in december borrowings by staar surgical ag under this loan outstanding as of january  were approximately  as of january   the company had net working capital of approximately million  as compared to million and million as of january  and december   respectively 
the increase in net working capital for the fiscal year ended january  was primarily attributable to a million increase in accounts receivable  a million increase in inventory  a million note receivable recorded in a settlement with a licensee  a million decrease in notes payable as a result of the full payment of a million note and the reclassification of debt from short term to long term offset by a million change in deferred income taxes 
the decrease in net working capital for the fiscal year ended january  was primarily attributable to a million increase in notes payable  million investment in patents and licenses  and million expended to acquire additional property and equipment  offset by a million increase in inventories and a million increase in cash 
as of january   the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  as compared to million and million as of january  and december   respectively 
the slight decline in the company s cash position for the year ended january  was primarily attributable to the increase in the effect of exchange rate changes in cash and cash equivalents 
the improvement in the company s cash position for the year ended january  was primarily attributable to net cash provided by operating activities approximately million and cash provided by financing activities approximately million  partially offset by cash used for the acquisition of property  plant and equipment to establish production facilities for new products and to improve operations for current products and reduce current manufacturing costs approximately million and to acquire patents and licenses and to fund patent litigation approximately million 
cash flows from operating activities for the year ended january  were approximately million  a decrease of approximately million from the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in cash flow from operating activities was principally attributable to a million change in operating working capital offset by a  increase in amortization of patents  licenses and other intangibles  and a million increase in deferred income taxes 
cash flows from operating activities for the year ended january  were approximately million  an improvement of approximately million from the prior fiscal year 
the increase in cash flow from operating activities was principally attributable to the utilization of deferred tax asset of million and an increase in depreciation and amortization of million 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended january   was million  representing a decrease of approximately million relative to the year ended january  this decrease was due primarily to a million decrease in the acquisition of property  plant and equipment and a million decrease in the acquisition of patents and licenses  partially offset by a  increase in other assets 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended january  was million  representing an increase of approximately million relative to the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to an increase of  in expenditures for property and equipment and million for patents and licenses 
cash flows from financing activities for the year ended january  were  representing a decrease of approximately million relative to the year ended january  this decrease was principally attributable to a million decrease in borrowings and a million increase in payments on notes payable and long term debt 
cash flows from financing activities for the year ended january  were million  representing an increase of approximately million relative to the year ended december  this increase was principally attributable to increased net borrowings of approximately million  increased exercises of stock options of  and decreased expenditures to repurchase common stock approximately  as compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
as of january   the company had  due with respect to an open ended capital lease agreement wherein the company leased million in surgical equipment 
the company s obligations under this lease agreement are secured by a  letter of credit 
the company s capital expenditures for the fiscal years ended january  and january  were approximately million and million  respectively 
these expenditures were used to upgrade existing production equipment  set up new production facilities for new products  and reduce current manufacturing costs 
the company s planned capital expenditures for are approximately million  primarily to improve and expand the company s foldable iol  icl tm and glaucoma wick tm manufacturing capacity and to reduce manufacturing costs 
capitalized additions for patents and licenses for the fiscal years ended january  and january  were approximately million and million  respectively 
the company capitalizes the costs of acquiring patents and licenses as well as the legal costs of defending its rights to these patents 
the company expects to spend approximately million in for patents and licenses 
management believes that cash flow from operations and available credit facilities  together with its current cash balances  will provide adequate financial resources to finance an increase in the level of the company s operations  including some capital expenditures  and research and development activities 
should additional funding be needed  such as for significantly increased levels of operations  major capital expenditures or acquisitions  the company believes  so long as the financial position of the company remains constant  that these funds could be obtained through borrowings or a secondary public offering 
other matters new accounting standards see recent accounting pronouncements in the consolidated financial statements 
foreign exchange management does not believe that the fluctuation in the value of the dollar in relation to the currencies of its suppliers or customers in the last three fiscal years has adversely affected the company s ability to purchase or sell products at agreed upon prices 
no assurance can be given  however  that adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations will not occur in the future  which would affect the company s operating results 
see uncertainties and risk factors risks associated with international transactions below 
inflation management believes inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations during the past three years 
year compliance management has reviewed the company s internal computer systems and software products for year problems and believes that such systems and products are  or will soon be  year compliant  and management therefore does not expect year considerations will materially impact the company s internal operations 
year considerations may have an affect on some of the company s customers and suppliers  and thus indirectly affect the company 
it is not possible to quantify the aggregate cost to the company with respect to customers and suppliers with year problems  although the company does not anticipate it will have a material adverse impact on its business 
uncertainties and risk factors the company may be subject to a number of significant uncertainties and risks including  without limitation and without purporting to be a complete or exhaustive list  those described below and those described elsewhere in this annual report  which may ultimately affect the company in a manner and to a degree which cannot be foreseen at this time 
risks relating to commercialization of new products 
the extent and pace of market acceptance of the company s new products  including its glaucoma wick tm  icl tm and staarvisc tm viscoelastic solution  will be a function of many variables  in the following the efficacy  performance and attributes of such new products  the ability of the company to obtain necessary regulatory approvals to commercially market such new products  the effectiveness of the company s marketing and sales efforts  including educating ophthalmologists and other potential customers as to the distinctive characteristics and benefits of these new products  the rate at which ophthalmologists attain the necessary surgical skills to implant these new products  the ability of the company to meet manufacturing and delivery schedules  and product pricing 
the extent and pace of market acceptance will also depend upon general economic conditions affecting customers purchasing patterns 
as the glaucoma wick tm and icl tm are new medical devices  there is a material risk that the marketplace may not accept  or be receptive to  the potential benefits of these new products 
unless and until these new products are accepted by the market and generating meaningful revenues and profits  the company s financial condition and prospects will continue to be solely dependent upon its line of cataract products 
see uncertainties and risk factors government regulation and uncertainty of product approval and business products 
highly competitive industry  rapid technological change 
competition in the ophthalmic industry is intense and characterized by extensive research and development and rapid technological change 
the company has licensed certain of its patents and technologies relating to its cataract products to competitors 
many of the company s current and prospective competitors have greater financial  technical and marketing resources and trade name recognition than the company  which may enable them to successfully develop and or market products based on technologies or approaches similar to those of the company  or develop products based on other technologies or approaches  which are  or may be  competitive with the company s products 
development by competitors of new or improved products  processes or technologies may make the company s products less competitive or obsolete 
the company will be required to devote significant financial and other resources to enhance its existing products and develop new products for the ophthalmic industry 
competitive pressures could lead to a decline in sales volumes of existing products  the inability to attain sufficient market penetration for new products  or price reductions  any or all of which could adversely affect the company s operating and financial results 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the industry  particularly in view of rapid technological change 
see business competition and business licenses and distribution rights in item government regulation and uncertainty of product approval 
the manufacture and sale of the company s products are subject to extensive international and domestic regulation 
in order to sell these products within the united states  clearance or approval from the fda is required 
the fda clearance or approval process is expensive and time consuming  and no assurance can be given that any of the company s products which have not received fda clearance or approval to date will obtain such fda clearance or approval on a timely basis or at all  or without delays adversely affecting the marketing and sale of the company s products 
foreign regulatory requirements differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may  in some cases  be more stringent or difficult to obtain than fda clearance or approval 
in order to sell products in the countries comprising the european economic union the union  the company must satisfy  by no later than  certain union wide regulatory requirements  notwithstanding the company s previous receipt of approvals from member countries 
no assurance can be given that the company will obtain such regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all  or without delays adversely affecting the marketing and sale of the company s products 
in addition  clearances or approvals that have been or may be granted are subject to continual review  which could result in product labeling restrictions  withdrawal of products from the market or other adverse consequences 
to date  the company has conducted clinical studies in certain foreign countries  and is in the process of conducting clinical studies in the united states  on the feasibility of i using the glaucoma wick tm for the treatment of glaucoma  and ii using the icl tm for the treatment of myopia and hyperopia 
there can be no assurance that the clinical trial results to date from these studies are necessarily indicative of future clinical trial results with respect to these new products 
there can also be no assurance that long term safety and efficacy data  when collected  will be consistent with the clinical results to date  and will demonstrate that i the glaucoma wick tm can be used safely and successfully to treat glaucoma in a broad segment of the patient population or on a long term basis  or ii that the icl tm can be used safely and successfully to treat myopia or hyperopia on a long term basis 
furthermore  no assurance can be given that there will be no serious complications or side effects  or that any such complications or side effects will not impair or delay the company s obtaining regulatory approval for these new products in the united states and other key markets 
in addition to the review and approval process for its products  the company is also subject to government regulation of its manufacturing facilities and procedures including good manufacturing practice regulations promulgated by the fda 
the company believes it is in compliance with all applicable regulations 
however  the fda and comparable regulatory agencies in other countries have substantial discretion in the interpretation and enforcement of applicable regulations 
there can be no assurance that future interpretations made by any regulatory bodies  including the fda  with possible retroactive effect  will not adversely affect the company 
moreover  the company could suffer a material adverse effect from a change in these regulations 
the company cannot predict the extent or impact of future federal  state  local or foreign legislation or regulation 
see business regulatory requirements in item if  as a result of fda inspections  mdr reports or other information  the fda believes that the company is not in compliance with the law  the fda can institute proceedings to detain or seize products  enjoin future violations  and or assess civil or criminal penalties against the company and its officers or employees 
although the company and its products have not been the subject of any such fda enforcement action  any such action by the fda could result in a disruption of the company s operations for an undetermined time 
patents and proprietary rights 
the company s ability to compete effectively is materially dependent upon the proprietary nature of the designs  processes  technologies and materials owned  used by or licensed to the company 
although the company attempts to protect its proprietary property  technologies and processes through a combination of patent law  trade secrets and non disclosure agreements  there is no assurance that any or all of these measures will prove to be effective 
for example  in the case of patents  there can be no assurance that existing patents granted to the company or its licensors will not be invalidated  that patents currently or prospectively applied for by the company or its licensors will be granted  or that patents will provide significant commercial benefits 
moreover  it is possible that competing companies may circumvent patents the company or its licensors have received or applied for by developing products which closely emulate but do not infringe the company s or its licensor s patents  and thereby market products that compete with the company s products without obtaining a license from the company 
in addition to patented or potentially patentable designs  technologies  processes and materials  the company also relies on proprietary designs  technologies  processes and know how not eligible for patent protection  and there is no assurance that competitors may not independently develop the same or superior designs  technologies  processes and know how 
the company believes that the international market for its products is as important as the domestic market  and therefore seeks patent protection for its products or those of its licensors in selected foreign countries 
because of the differences in foreign patent and other laws concerning proprietary rights  the company s products may not receive the same degree of protection in certain foreign countries as they would in the united states 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully defend its patents and proprietary rights 
the invalidation or circumvention of key patents principally the company s core patents for insertion of foldable or deformable iols or icls through minimally invasive surgical techniques or proprietary rights owned by or licensed to the company could have an adverse effect on the company and on its business prospects 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to defend against litigation involving the patents or proprietary rights of others  or that licenses under such rights will be available 
legal and accounting costs relating to prosecuting or defending patent infringement litigation may be substantial 
see business intellectual property rights in item third party reimbursement 
the company s ability to sell its products is  in part  dependent upon policies of government or private third party payors regarding reimbursement to ophthalmic surgeons with respect to their use of the company s products 
there can be no assurance that such third party payors will continue to authorize or otherwise budget reimbursement for use of the company s existing products principally its iols at current levels 
for example  reimbursement rates for iols  such as that of medicare  have declined in recent years 
changes in policies regarding reimbursement for ophthalmic products or services could adversely affect the prospects for future sales of the company s products 
the company does not expect that icls tm will be eligible for reimbursement  and there can be no assurance that any of the company s other new products will be eligible for reimbursement by government or private third party payors 
risks associated with international transactions 
the company sells its products internationally which subjects it to several potential risks  including risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates  the regulation of fund transfers by foreign governments  united states and foreign export and import duties and tariffs  and political instability 
there can be no assurance that any of the foregoing will not have a material adverse effect upon the business of the company 
the company has not previously engaged in activities to mitigate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations  as the company is generally paid in us dollars with respect to its international operations 
if earnings from international operations increase  the company s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies may increase  and the company may utilize forward exchange rate contracts or engage in other efforts to mitigate foreign currency risks 
if entered into  there can be no assurance as to the effectiveness of such efforts in limiting any adverse effects of foreign currency fluctuations on the company s international operations and on the company s overall results of operations

product liability claims  insufficiency of product liability insurance coverage  product recall risks 
as a supplier of products used in medical treatments  the company faces an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event the end use of its products results in unanticipated adverse effects on patients  including serious personal injury or death 
certain of the company s new products  such as its glaucoma wick tm and its icl tm  are based upon unique designs and materials 
product liability risk is higher with respect to these products  as they have a limited history of testing  use and performance  and unknown defects associated with such products may only be identified through the passage of time 
potential negative publicity concerning the defective product could also affect the company s other products 
no assurance can be given that the company will not experience product liability claims in the future with respect to its established or new products 
any product liability claim could have a material adverse effect on the company 
any product liability claims will be subject to the uncertainties attendant to litigation 
the company currently maintains product liability insurance coverage 
no assurance can be given that such insurance coverage is in an amount sufficient to cover all possible liabilities  or one or more large claims  or that the insurer will be solvent at the time of any covered loss 
also  no assurance can be given that adequate product liability insurance will continue to be available in the future or maintained at a reasonable cost to the company 
in the event of a successful product liability suit against the company  lack or insufficiency of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company may  in the event there are material deficiencies or defects in the design or manufacture of any of its products  be required to recall such defective products 
in the event of a product recall  the cost to  and the potential liability of  the company could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operations  especially if such liability relates to the recall of a product generating significant revenues and earnings for the company  such as its foldable iols 
potential negative publicity from a recall could also adversely affect sales and or regulatory approvals of the company s other products
