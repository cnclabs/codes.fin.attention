see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the acquired companies 
the company s consolidated comparable store sales increased in fiscal with a comparable store growth at cole optical and a comparable store sales decline at things remembered 
the increase at cole optical was primarily a result of successful eyewear promotions and growth in managed vision care sales

operating expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  operating expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the leverage improvement was primarily a result of the addition of pearle  which has lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenue than the rest of the company  along with leverage gains achieved by cole optical s comparable store sales increase 
this was offset in part by leverage losses at things remembered resulting from the decline in comparable store sales 
operating expenses increased primarily because of the acquired companies and the classification of capitation and other fees as revenue 
the expense increase reflected higher advertising expenditures  payroll costs  and store occupancy expenses  as well as expenses related to the growth of managed vision care 
advertising expenditures at cole optical were increased for optical promotions and pearle name awareness

operating income  excluding charges for business integration and other non recurring items from each year  increased to million in fiscal from million the prior year  primarily the result of the acquired companies and comparable store sales growth at cole optical  offset in part by soft sales performance at things remembered 
net interest expense for fiscal of million increased million compared to fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to the additional interest on million of senior subordinated notes due the notes issued in connection with financing the pearle acquisition and million of senior subordinated notes due the notes issued in august this was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense due to the purchase and subsequent retirement of million of senior notes due the senior notes in the second quarter of fiscal and the purchase and retirement of million of senior notes in conjunction with a tender offer in september the issuance of the notes  combined with the redemption of the senior notes  is expected to reduce fiscal interest expense by more than million compared to fiscal the income tax provisions for fiscal and include million and million  respectively  of income tax benefits related to the charges for business integration and other non recurring items
