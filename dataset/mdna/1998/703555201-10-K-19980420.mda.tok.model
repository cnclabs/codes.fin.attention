year compliance the year will pose a unique set of challenges to those industries reliant on information technology 
as a result of methods employed by early programmers  many software applications and operational programs may be unable to distinguish the year from the year if not effectively addressed  this problem could result in the production of inaccurate data  or  in the worst cases  the inability of the systems to continue to function altogether 
the company and other retailers are vulnerable to the industry s dependence on electronic point of sale and inventory control systems 
in may  the company initiated the process of preparing its computer systems and applications for the year this process included replacing the store point of sale systems during the third quarter of fiscal and will involve upgrading corporate hardware and software components by the first quarter of fiscal management estimates the total cumulative costs will be approximately million  which includes the million already invested in the new point of sale systems 
management believes that the expenditures required to bring the company s systems into compliance will not have a materially adverse effect on the company s performance 
however  the year problem is pervasive and complex and can potentially affect any computer process 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that the year compliance can be achieved without additional unanticipated expenditures and uncertainties that might affect future financial results 
inflation the effect of changing prices had minimal impact on sales and cost of sales during the past three years 
occupancy costs and certain selling  general and administrative costs have been affected by inflation during the period 
in general these increases have been modest and reflect current trends
