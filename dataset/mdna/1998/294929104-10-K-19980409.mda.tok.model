el comandante had significant growth in revenues from through which resulted largely from i the conversion commencing in november and completed in of over otb agencies to an on line computerized wagering system  ii the increase in otb agencies to at december   ii the expansion of betting program to offer additional wagers  iv the broadcasting of all of its races throughout puerto rico via commercial television until november  ecoc televised only sunday races and  v the introduction in august of a jackpot pool pool pote  which is paid out only in the event a single bettor wins the regular pick six pool 
these actions resulted in substantial increases in wagering from million in to million in as betting opportunities became more attractive and more convenient to wagering patrons 
however  due to regulatory changes in otb agents commissions and other uncontrollable factors  wagering decreased to million in  remained at the same level in and decreased to million in in february the number of race days at el comandante was increased from four to five days a week and  at the same time  the number of races per day was reduced  resulting in an increase to approximately races per week from approximately races per week 
the average daily wagering handle decreased  as expected  but the extra day has compensated for the decrease 
the extra race day per week provides an extra pick pool wager each week  this wager is favored by bettors and provides a higher commission to ecoc than other wagers 
the mix of wagers usually affects ecoc s percentage of the total wagers it received as commissions 
revenues 
decreased in by  from revenues from the puerto rico operations include i rental income earned from the lease of el comandante to ecoc and ii interest income from short term investments and a note receivable from ecoc 
the el comandante lease  which was terminated effective december   required payment of rent consisting of of ecoc s commissions on wagering 
in  rental income decreased by   when there was commissions on wagering of  average take on race days  compared to  when there was commissions on wagering of  average take on race days 
the decrease is attributable  at least in part  to additional gaming opportunities that are available to the public  particularly slot machines in new casino hotels and up graded slot machines in existing casino hotels 
in august ecoc implemented two new wagers  a pick and trifecta  which helped to slow the decline in wagering 
due to ecoc s default for unpaid rent and for certain other defaults under the el comandante lease  hda terminated the el comandante lease 
effective january  el comandante is operated by ecmc  a wholly owned subsidiary of hda see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
expenses 
increased in by  from the increase was caused primarily by hda s assumption  effective january  of the obligation to pay the annual fee of  for the el comandante racing license  which was paid by ecoc through page dominican republic operations the accounting records of galapagos are maintained in dominican republic pesos and converted to us dollars based on the average exchange rate during the reporting period 
consequently  fluctuations in exchange rates have an effect in the results of operations of galapagos  when reported in us dollars 
the average exchange rate for was pesos to one us dollar  compared to pesos to one us dollar in revenues 
increased in by  from revenues from the dominican republic operations include commissions on wagering of galapagos of  in  when there were race days and an average of agencies on line  and  in  when there were race days and an average of agencies on line 
the  increase in commissions on wagering was attributable primarily to the introduction in august of new wagers with local pool bets on simulcasted races from el comandante and to more agencies on line during the increase in revenues from other sources was attributed to  in net fees earned under a contract for providing the distribution system of an electronic lottery that commenced in november  and  of economic assistance in received from the dominican republic government to improve racing  offset in part by a reduction in restaurant revenues at v centenario when galapagos discontinued operating the restaurant in august and sub leased it to a third party 
the government provided economic assistance from july thru january from taxes it received on wagering on simulcasted races from el comandante 
management requested an extension beyond january  but no response has been received from the government 
however  a portion of the government s taxes are being set aside in a restricted account pending the government s final decision 
if the economic assistance is not extended  it could have an adverse effect in galapagos financial conditions and its future results of operations 
expenses 
expenses from the dominican republic operations in remained at the same level as in an intensified effort by the management of galapagos reduced controllable costs in in a broad range of expense categories 
these reductions were offset by i increased expenditures for advertising and television  primarily related to the expansion of otb agencies outside the santo domingo metropolitan area where television coverage of the races commenced july and ii reduced funds available for reimbursement of expenses arising from an account funded from a portion of wagers on pool bets 
the decrease in these funds resulted from an agreement with horseowners effective july whereby they are entitled to of these funds as purses  whereas galapagos previously received the entire amount 
galapagos share will further be reduced to in july and to in july television stations the television stations were sold in transactions closed in august and january  resulting in gains of  and  respectively 
during the revenues and expenses of the television stations were  and  respectively  while in there were no operations 
page financial expenses financial expenses decreased in by  as compared with excluding financial expenses in related to the television stations  the decrease was  and was primarily caused by interest savings attributable to i final payments of the company s loan during outstanding balance at december  was  and ii redemption of  of first mortgage notes in depreciation depreciation decreased in by  as compared with excluding depreciation in related to the television stations  the change was not significant 
other expenses other expenses increased in by  as compared with  principally due to  in non recurring costs incurred by hda for the cancellation of certain ecoc obligations to supra aggregating  the cancellation was done in connection with hda s redemption in august of supra s interest in hda 
the cancellation relieved hda of its guarantee of approximately million of the  obligation which would have become due upon termination of the el comandante lease 
there was also an increase in costs and expenses reimbursed by the company to emc  its managing general partner  for services rendered by emc s executives to the company 
effective january   the only significant services rendered by emc to the company will be services of directors since employees of emc were transferred to a new wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
provision for income taxes the provision for income tax is primarily related to puerto rico income taxes on the company s distributive share of hda s income from puerto rico sources  without taking into account galapagos losses or expenses of the company 
the deferred income taxes are related to the difference between the tax basis of the company s investment in hda and the amount reported in the financial statements 
in  approximately  of the deferred income tax provision is related to the reversal of the tax benefit recorded by the company in prior years for the accumulated operating losses of the television stations  as a result of the sale of s e in january see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for composition of the provision for income taxes 
minority interest the minority interest in was based on of hda s net income reduced by of galapagos net losses 
for  the bases for recognition of minority interest changed as follows i following redemption of supra s interest in hda in august  minority interest in hda was based on of hda s net income and ii because accumulated losses of galapagos allocable to minority stockholders exceeded their page investment  minority interest in galapagos net losses was reduced by  commencing in  i if and while galapagos continues generating losses  no minority interest in galapagos net losses will be recognized by the company  and ii if galapagos generates profits  no minority interest in galapagos net income will be recognized by the company  up to  extraordinary item on september  hda redeemed first mortgage notes in the principal amount of million at of par 
this redemption was made in connection with the approval obtained from the holders of first mortgage notes to redeem the interest in hda owned by supra 
the  premium and related bond discount and deferred financing costs were written off in as an extraordinary item 
there were no similar charges in the comparable period of however  the company is required to make an offer by december  to redeem million in first mortgage notes  at of par 
if redeemed  the company will also recognize an extraordinary item in for the premium and related write offs 
historical compared to proforma the following discussion of results of operations for as compared to is made based on unaudited proforma balances for as if the accounts of hda had been included in the company s financial statements at december puerto rico operations revenues 
increased in by  from  principally due to an increase in interest income on short term investments 
rental income from el comandante did not change significantly  in and  in rental income in was based on of ecoc s commissions of  from el comandante wagering on racing days  whereas rental income was based on of ecoc s commissions of  from wagering on racing days  plus fixed rent of  eliminated effective january  
in february  ecoc commenced racing five days a week by adding thursday to its previous four day race week 
although the average daily commissions earned by ecoc declined in the period  the commissions earned on thursday race days more than offset the decline in average daily commissions 
the effect of the additional race day is shown by the comparison of january and commissions earned by ecoc before introduction of thursday racing  and the comparison of february december  commissions earned before thursday racing commenced with commissions earned february december after thursday racing commenced 
whereas the january commissions were  less than the january commissions  the average monthly commissions for the balance of exceeded by  the average monthly commissions in the comparable months of page expenses 
increased in by  from the increase was caused primarily by hda s assumption  effective january  of the obligation to pay real property taxes on el comandante  which were paid by ecoc through dominican republic operations revenues 
revenues in increased by  from due to increased commissions on wagering 
galapagos began simulcasting el comandante races on february  to several sports betting agencies in the dominican republic and commenced live racing operations at v centenario in april the increase in commissions is attributable to i full year of racing in versus partial year in and ii growth in the number otb agencies agencies when v centenario opened in april  at december  and at december  galapagos also had revenues of  in and  in from jockey club and restaurant operations and other miscellaneous sources 
expenses 
increased in by  from costs incurred in connection with the dominican republic operations prior to the opening of v centenario in april  where deferred as start up costs  whereas under full operation during all operating costs were expensed 
certain costs  such as horseowners share of commissions  ecoc s management fee and fees paid to autotote for providing the wagering system  are directly related to the amount of wagering or to commissions earned by galapagos and  accordingly  accounted for a portion of the increase 
the other increases in costs are largely attributable to the additional months that v centenario operated in  offset in part by credits of  for funds released for galapagos marketing costs from a restricted account upon authorization of the government 
television stations overview 
on august   hda closed the sale of a interest in television stations to paxson  and consequently  the accounts of s e were included in the company s consolidated financial statements only through august the sales price was million  and a gain of  was recorded in for this sale 
the costs of this sale included approximately million for employee severance payments  costs to cancel certain contracts  write off of deferred costs not recoverable under the revised broadcasting and programming format  legal  accounting and investment bankers fees  and fees to holders of first mortgage notes for consenting to the transaction

the costs include fees of  to paxson pursuant to the time brokerage agreement for the seven months from february through august costs between periods are not readily comparable because i certain costs were deferred during the test period  ii the change in the broadcasting and programming format which commenced february resulted in significant reductions in production and programming costs in and iii fees to paxson of  in financial expenses financial expenses in increased by  from the increase was primarily caused by interest in on a debt to the dominican republic government and on advances to the company by its general partner  net of a  reversal of interest on loans to minority stockholders 
galapagos pays taxes to the government of the dominican republic based on a percentage of wagering 
the government agreed to a deferred payment plan for taxes of approximately  and interest of  was accrued in on this deferred liability 
the balance of the indebtedness was  at december  depreciation depreciation increased in by  from the increase is primarily caused by capital additions to el comandante during the year 
property and equipment of v centenario was not depreciated until the commencement of its live racing operations on april   while there was a full year of depreciation in depreciation of  in and  in was related to a step up of  in el comandante assets 
the step up is the value assigned hdamc s interest in hda which was transferred to the company in march in exchange for units of the company 
other expenses other expenses decreased in by  from the decrease results from costs of i  in  related to the application by vjc  a subsidiary of the company currently inactive  for a license to operate a race track in virginia and vjc s appeal of the grant of the license to another applicant and ii  for legal  accounting and other costs incurred in connection with the distribution in february by igc to its unitholders of a interest in the company

hda had previously provided for deferred dominican republic income taxes on interest accrued on stockholders loans to galapagos 
the accrued interest was forgiven in and a tax credit was recorded for reversal of the deferred tax provision applicable to the forgiven interest 
compared to historical the company did not consolidate the accounts of hda until march  accordingly  the company s historical results of operations for and are not readily comparable and the discussion below is limited to a comparison of revenues and expenses of the company and vjc for these years 
other revenues 
the company received a cash distribution of  from hda in february and insignificant amounts of interest income in both years 
because the company had a zero investment in hda when the cash distribution of  was received in february and since the distribution was received prior to the consolidation of hda s accounts as of march   the distribution represented revenue to the company that was not eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
other expenses 
the changes in expenses were primarily reductions in in igc and emc support services of  and costs of  related to investigating new business opportunities  and increases in in legal  accounting and consulting fees and directors fees and expenses 
in there were also costs of  related to vjc s application for licenses to own and operate virginia s first thoroughbred racing and pari mutuel wagering facility and to vjc s appeal of the grant of the license to another applicant

hda had previously provided for deferred dominican republic income taxes on interest accrued on stockholders loans to galapagos 
the accrued interest was forgiven in and a tax credit was recorded for reversal of the deferred tax provision applicable to the forgiven interest 
page liquidity and capital resources the company s principal source of cash during the year was distributions from hda  which are eliminated in the company s consolidated financial statements 
pursuant to the indenture for the issuance of its first mortgage notes  hda s ability to make distributions to its partners is restricted to approximately of hda s consolidated book income 
in connection with the redemption in august of a interest owned by a minority partner a transaction that required the approval of holders of first mortgage notes  hda agreed to reduce its distributions by 
because cash held by hda and its subsidiaries is not readily available to the company  capital resources and liquidity of the company and hda are discussed separately 
liquidity and capital resources of the company 
cash of the company at december  was approximately at the same level as december  the company s sources of cash for were  in cash distributions from hda and  in commissions related to the sale of the television stations 
these sources were sufficient to cover the operating activities of the company and its financial obligations with respect to a bank loan and advances received in prior years from a general partner 
at december   the company had paid all of its loans 
effective january   emc transferred to the company i its agreements to provide certain management services to hda and each of its subsidiaries and ii the executives rendering these services 
management estimates cash requirements in approximately million and cash receipts of approximately million from the following sources arising from transactions that will be eliminated in the company s consolidated financial statements i cash distributions from hda  estimated at  see liquidity and capital resources of hda ii estimated fees of million earned by the company under these management agreements and iii collection of approximately  of its receivables from subsidiaries 
the company s liquidity greatly depends on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay the fees for services and their payables to the company and hda s ability to make cash distributions to the company 
because galapagos has generated losses in prior years and egp is a start up operation  there is no assurance that the entire amount of these fees will be collected 
liquidity and capital resources of hda 
cash and cash equivalents of hda  excluding its consolidated subsidiaries  decreased by  during to  at december  hda s uses of cash for financing and investing activities were i redemption of  in first mortgage notes  ii redemption of a minority interest in hda for million  iii cash distributions to partners of  iv capital improvements to el comandante of  v investment in galapagos of  and vi investment in egp of  of which million was paid to the panama government for the right to operate presidente remon 
the million proceeds of sale in january of a interest in the television stations and proceeds of a million loan in december  together with hda s beginning page cash balance and cash flows from operations primarily from its rental activities related to el comandante were sufficient to cover hda s capital requirements and financial obligations 
the million loan from a financial institution is payable in four quarterly installments of  commencing april  due to an ecoc default for unpaid rent and certain other reasons permitted under the el comandante lease  hda terminated the el comandante lease on december  on january   ecoc transferred to ecmc  a wholly owned subsidiary of hda  all assets employed in the racing business and the operating license  and ecmc assumed all agreements of ecoc and its liabilities  including certain capital leases 
at december  ecoc s liabilities exceeded assets by million including certain payables to hda amounting to million 
the termination of the el comandante lease and the assignment of the operating license to ecmc are subject to the approval of the pr racing board 
the racing board has not given final approval but has permitted ecmc to operate el comandante until the review process is concluded 
management expects that approval of these transactions to be subject to making the company and hda i primarily responsible to ensure that ecmc complies with all terms and provisions of the operating license and applicable regulations and orders of the racing board  and ii jointly liable with ecmc with respect to all financial commitments with horseowners 
as a result of the termination of the el comandante lease  commencing in hda s principal source of revenues will be commissions on wagering on el comandante s races and on simulcasted races  principally to the dominican republic and panama 
management has projected commissions on wagering for at the same level as in  approximately million 
during wagering in puerto rico on el comandante races declined  in part due to additional gaming opportunities  particularly additional and up graded slot machines 
however  management expects to partially offset this negative effect by expanding simulcasting of el comandante races in the caribbean and central america countries and installing local telephone betting in the dominican republic  panama and  subject to the approval of the pr racing board  in puerto rico 
capital requirements and financial obligations of hda in and anticipated cash distributions to partners are expected to be covered by cash flows from operations and net cash flows from its investment in egp see discussion below 
hda has budgeted million in capital improvements to el comandante 
the financial requirements of hda and ecmc consist of i principal payments on capital leases  ii principal payments on the december loan of million discussed above and iii million for redemption of first mortgage notes 
hda is required to make an offer not later than december  to redeem first mortgage notes in the principal amount of million at of par or it will have to pay a penalty of  equal to of the principal amount of outstanding first mortgage notes 
hda s ability to redeem the million of first mortgage notes and make page distributions to partners will partly depend on recovering from egp  of the funds invested in panama in and any additional funds invested in the recovery requires the closing of an underwriting of egp s equity and debt securities 
in january  egp received a million bridge loan from an investment banker in panama and an underwriting proposal to raise  in a private placement of registered securities  approximately million from the sale of of egp s capital stock and million of egp s unsecured debt 
the unsecured debt is proposed to contain the following terms i interest rate  ii interest payments during the first two years  monthly payments of principal and interest for next four years  and a balloon principal payment at maturity in six years and iii requirement for hda to maintain a capital investment in egp of million  the maximum amount permitted under hda s indenture once egp ceases to be a wholly owned subsidiary of hda 
upon closing of the underwriting  the bridge loan and accrued interest will be repaid  hda will recover all funds invested in egp in excess of the million permitted amount  and the balance of the proceeds after offering costs will be available for egp s capital improvements to presidente remon  acquisition of equipment and working capital 
under the contract for the operation of presidente remon  egp is required to invest million during the first four years in capital improvements and acquisition of wagering and race track equipment 
management expects the egp underwriting to close in june but there can be no assurance that this deadline will be met 
if the offering is not closed before june  and as a consequence hda does not recover  of its investment at december  and any additional funds invested in by that date  hda may temporarily need another source of funds to make the million interest payment on its first mortgage notes due on june  in addition to capital leases assumed from ecoc  hda s long term cash commitments are charitable contributions of  and repayment commencing in of first mortgage notes 
in connection with the termination of the el comandante lease  ecmc assumed commitments to make contributions of  to certain charitable and educational institutions as follows  in   in   in and  in management expects to satisfy these obligations 
hda s first mortgage notes bear interest at  payable semiannually on june and december  and are secured by el comandante assets 
the first mortgage notes are redeemable  at the option of hda  at redemption prices decreasing from to of par  depending upon the redemption date see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the stated maturity dates are as follows  in decreased by any amount of first mortgage notes redeemed in   in   in and  in at maturity 
management expects to refinance this obligation in year computer issue 
many computer systems in use today were designed and developed using two digits  rather than four  to specify the year 
page as a result  such systems will recognize the year as 
this could cause many computer applications to fail completely or to create erroneous results unless corrective measures are taken 
the company and its subsidiaries utilize software and related computer technologies essential to its operations that will be affected by the year issue 
the company is studying what actions will be necessary to make its computer systems year compliant 
the expense associated with these actions cannot presently be determined  but could be significant
