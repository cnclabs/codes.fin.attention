item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
general the company is a holding company whose subsidiaries own and operate short line and regional freight railroads and provide related rail services 
the company  through its industrial switching subsidiary  also provides freight car switching and related services to united states industries with extensive railroad facilities within their complexes 
the company generates revenues primarily from the movement of freight over track owned or operated by its railroads 
the company also generates non freight revenues primarily by providing freight car switching and related rail services such as railcar leasing  railcar repair and storage to industries with extensive railroad facilities within their complexes  to shippers along its lines  and to the class i railroads that connect with its lines 
the company s operating expenses include wages and benefits  equipment rents including car hire  purchased services  depreciation and amortization  diesel fuel  casualties and insurance  materials and other expenses 
car hire is a charge paid by a railroad to the owners of railcars used by that railroad in moving freight 
other expenses generally include property and other non income taxes  professional services  communication and data processing costs and general overhead expense 
when comparing the company s results of operations from one reporting period to another  the following factors should be taken into consideration 
the company has historically experienced fluctuations in revenues and expenses such as one time freight moves  customer plant expansions and shut downs  railcar sales  accidents and derailments 
in periods when these events occur  results of operations are not easily comparable to other periods 
also  much of the company s growth to date has resulted from acquisitions 
the company completed two acquisitions during the first four months of  one in november  and another in november because of variations in the structure  timing and size of these acquisitions and differences in economics among the company s railroads resulting from differences in the rates and other material terms established through negotiation  the company s results of operations in any reporting period may not be directly comparable to its results of operations in other reporting periods
