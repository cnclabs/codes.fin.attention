the company s business strategy is to be a global provider of environmental and infrastructure solutions to both the government and private industry clients 
as part of this strategy  the company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire ohm corporation on january  and the first step of the merger agreement was completed through a tender offer on february  at which time the company owned international technology corporation results of operations continued approximately of the outstanding shares of ohm 
the second step of the acquisition was successfully completed on june  and created a company with projected annual revenues of approximately billion and backlog at march  of approximately billion 
the company has also diversified through several acquisitions of specialized companies primarily serving targeted commercial markets 
revenues revenues for fiscal year were  up percent or  from the  revenues reported in the prior fiscal year 
fiscal year includes the results of ohm corporation ohm since february   the date on which it acquired a controlling interest 
revenues related to ohm in the fourth quarter were  a significant portion of the increase in revenues approximately  is due to revenues generated from acquired businesses including ohm 
revenue from the company s federal government contracts increased approximately percent in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year revenues from federal government contracts excluding ohm  increased percent during these same comparative periods 
although revenue growth excluding acquisitions in the company s construction and remediation business is expected to be modest in the near future due to difficult industry wide conditions  the company has aggressively targeted revenue growth and diversification through business acquisitions as evidenced by the businesses acquired during fiscal year in addition to the ohm acquisition  the company purchased four other companies during fiscal year these acquisitions include  phr  a consulting firm which assists business entities to more economically confront potential or existing environmental liabilities through an interdisciplinary investigation approach of science  history and information  peg  a company providing a broad range of environmental consulting and engineering services to major oil companies  mainly in the western united states  jsc  a company providing economically driven  science based environmental consulting and advocacy services  and landbank inc  a real estate and restoration company focusing on environmentally impaired properties 
a substantial percentage of the company s revenues during the three years ended march  was earned through executing governmental contracts for various federal  state and local agencies 
revenues from governmental contracts accounted for of the company s revenues in fiscal year compared to and in fiscal years and  respectively 
see the table in business operations customers federal  state and local governmental clients for an analysis of the company s revenues attributable to federal  state and local governmental contracts 
federal governmental revenues are derived principally from work performed for the dod and  to a lesser extent  the doe 
in the near term  the company expects that the percentage of total revenues from the execution of federal  state and local governmental contracts will continue to be substantial and increase due to the acquisition of ohm 
during fiscal year  the dod revenues of  exceeded fiscal year revenues of  by  of this improvement in dod revenues  about one half resulted from the ohm acquisition and the balance from increased funding of the company s dod indefinite delivery order programs and an increase in the number of dod contracts being executed 
the company expects to continue to derive a substantial portion of its revenues from the dod indefinite delivery order contracts which are primarily related to remedial action work 
overall  revenue levels from the company s federal government contracts excluding ohm have gradually improved during these comparative periods as strong improvement in dod activity was partially offset by the completion of contracts funded by other government agencies including the doe 
doe revenues declined by from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year ohm s doe revenues were not significant for the five week period ending march   however  the company has received recent doe awards 
management expects to increase its revenues from the doe in the future due to an expected transition by the doe over the next several years to emphasize remediation over studies combined with the company s favorable experience in winning and executing similar work for the dod and the company s experience international technology corporation results of operations continued with doe related to its past performance of doe studies 
evidence of the company s efforts to benefit from this transition is the award in october of a  project to perform the excavation  pretreatment and drying of an estimated one million tons of contaminated materials for the doe s fernald environmental management project and the recent award  to provide architect  engineering  construction and construction management services at the doe s rocky flats environmental technology site near denver  colorado 
the company reported an increase in revenue from the commercial sector of  or for fiscal year  when compared to fiscal year of this  revenue increase  was attributable to targeted commercial business opportunities and resulted from business acquisitions including ohm 
revenue growth from the commercial sector excluding recent acquisitions could be restricted in the near term partly due to increased emphasis on competitively bid lower cost solutions and partly due to delaying certain work until final congressional action is taken on the reauthorization of cercla 
as for cercla  it is uncertain when reauthorization will occur or what the details of the legislation  including retroactive liability  cleanup standards  and remedy selection  may include 
uncertainty regarding possible rollbacks of environmental regulation and or reduced enforcement have led some commercial clients to delay projects as well 
contemplated changes in regulations could further decrease the demand for certain of the company s services  as customers anticipate and adjust to the new regulations 
however  legislative or regulatory changes could also result in increased demand for certain of the company s services if such changes decrease the cost of remediation projects or result in more funds being spent for actual remediation 
the ultimate impact of any such changes will depend upon a number of factors  including the overall strength of the us economy and customers views on the cost effectiveness of the remedies available 
revenues for fiscal year of  were below the  revenue level of fiscal year this decline in revenues generally reflected the weak demand in both governmental and commercial markets served by the company  as well as a change in the company s approach to the market in de emphasizing smaller lower value projects in fiscal year in addition  revenues declined in fiscal year due to delays in the authorization of the federal budget that reduced funding of governmental projects 
revenues derived from large  complex thermal remediation contracts utilizing the company s htts thermal treatment technology were approximately  and of revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
incineration as a remedy under cercla has come under legislative and regulatory pressures 
because of this issue  and the relatively higher cost of incineration and the lack of regulatory approved potential project opportunities in the united states  the company has been forced to seek alternative uses for its htts equipment 
until recently  the company had been actively pursuing foreign and domestic potential opportunities which utilize the htts equipment 
the two foreign thermal htts installations it had been pursuing through joint ventures have been slowed by circumstances outside of it s control 
at march   the net book value of it s htts equipment  related spare parts inventory and related foreign joint ventures ownership interests was approximately  it s htts equipment is currently idle 
on may   it s board of directors approved plans to exit the htts incineration business

backlog revenues are expected to be earned primarily over the next one to five years  with a substantial portion of the backlog consisting of governmental contracts  many of which are subject to annual funding and definition of project scope 
the backlog amounts at march  and march  include  and  respectively  of future work the company estimates it will receive based on historical experience under existing ido programs 
in accordance with industry practices  substantially all of the company s contracts are subject to cancellation  delay or modification by the customer 
international technology corporation results of operations continued the company s backlog at any given time is subject to changes in scope of services required by the contracts leading to increases or decreases in backlog amounts
