item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s business is seasonal with higher sales reported in the second half of the year due to the higher price points of a significant portion of the company s products which are sold during the fall and holiday seasons 
the seasonality of the company s business also affects borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreement 
the amount outstanding under the revolving credit agreement fluctuates as a result of seasonal demands for the company s products 
traditional quarterly fluctuations in the company s business may vary in the future depending upon  among other things  changes in order cycles and product mix 
the company s business is vulnerable to a number of factors beyond its control 
these include player strikes  owner lockouts  work stoppages  the granting of additional licenses to competitors  some of which licensees have greater financial resources and manufacturing capabilities than the company  and changes in consumer tastes and enthusiasm for spectator sports 
the company s business can also be affected by other matters which impact the retail marketplace  including increased credit and inventory exposure  consolidation and resulting decline in the number of retailers and other cyclical economic factors 
the company seeks to minimize inventory exposure by encouraging retailers to place orders five to six months in advance of the date products are scheduled to be delivered 
this provides the company with better information to purchase product for its reorder business 
a substantial portion of the company s products are manufactured through arrangements with independent contractors located in foreign countries 
in addition  the company s import operations are subject to constraints imposed by bilateral textile agreements between the united states and a number of foreign countries 
the agreements impose quotas on the amount and type of goods which can be imported into the united states from these countries 
the company s operations may be adversely affected by political instability resulting in the disruption of trade from foreign countries in which the company s contractors and suppliers are located  the imposition of additional regulations relating to imports or duties  taxes  quotas and other charges on imports 
the company is unable to predict whether any additional regulations  duties  taxes  quotas or other charges may be imposed on the importation of its products 
the assessment of any of these items could result in increases in the cost of such imports and affect the sales or profitability of the company 
in addition  the failure of one or more manufacturers to ship some or all of the company s orders could impact the company s ability to deliver products to its customers on time 
delays in delivery could result in missing certain retailing seasons with respect to some or all of the company s products or could otherwise adversely affect the company 
this discussion contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of actual results could differ materially from those set forth in such statements due to various factors 
such factors include product demand and market acceptance risks  the effect of changing economic conditions  the impact of competitive products and pricing risks associated with product development and other risk factors detailed above
