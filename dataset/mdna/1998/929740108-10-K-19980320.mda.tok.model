in  wabco completed the stone  thermo king and hp acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash including million of assumed debt

the company purchased million shares at per share  and investors consisting of vestar equity partners  lp  harvard private capital group  american industrial partners capital fund ii  lp and certain members of wabco s management acquired the remaining million shares at the same price 
the company financed the million share repurchase through borrowings under its credit facility 
in connection with the establishment of the esop in january  the company made a million loan to the esop  which was used to purchase  shares of the company s outstanding common stock 
the esop loan had an original term of years  with annual payments of principal and interest of approximately million 
the esop loan bears interest at per annum 
the esop will repay the esop loan using contributions from the company 
the company is obligated to contribute amounts sufficient to repay the esop loan 
the net effect of the esop is that the company s stock is allocated to employees in lieu a retirement plan that was previously a cash based defined benefit plan and  accordingly  results in reduced annual cash outlays by an estimated to million

nevertheless  the company will remain leveraged to a significant extent and its debt service obligations will continue to be substantial 
if the company s sources of funds were to fail to satisfy the company s cash requirements  the company may need to refinance its existing debt or obtain additional financing 
there is no assurance that such new financing alternatives would be available  and  in any case  such new financing  if available  would be expected to be more costly and burdensome than the debt agreements currently in place

the new system is expected to be operational by late and will be year compliant 
the majority of the expenditures incurred for hardware and purchased software related to this project are capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful lives 
other costs are expensed as incurred

investors must recognize that events could turn out to be significantly different from what is expected 
differences from expectations in the factors listed below  among others  could affect the company s financial performance in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such forward looking statements
