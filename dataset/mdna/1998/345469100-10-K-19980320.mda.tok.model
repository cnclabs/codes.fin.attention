on october   the company signed an extension of the exclusive endorsement of the company by the american association of retired persons aarp  to offer mobile home insurance to its members through the year the results of this program  since its inception in  encouraged both parties to extend their relationship five years beyond the original agreement s expiration date 
underwriting results and loss reserves the combined loss and expense ratio for the company s property and casualty insurance operations was in compared to in and in the underwriting profit from these operations was million in  million in  and million in the company believes that its emphasis on rate adequacy  disciplined underwriting  catastrophe exposure management and strategic expense reduction and management programs  have contributed significantly to the company s positive underwriting results over the last several years 
catastrophe losses impact on property and casualty results declined in to  net of reinsurance  million  compared to the record levels in of million and million in the only major storms of occurred in the northwest during the first quarter of the year 
the record catastrophe losses of resulted from significant storms in the northwest and northeast portions of the country during the first and fourth quarters 
these storms created massive damage in oregon  washington  pennsylvania and new york 
hurricane fran also struck north carolina in the third quarter of during  hurricanes opal and erin along with spring and winter storms in california  oregon and washington  contributed to the third worst catastrophe year in the company s history 
management monitors its exposure to catastrophic risk and has taken aggressive action in coastal areas and earthquake prone areas to reduce the company s risk to hurricane and earthquake losses 
during  the company took action against another catastrophic risk by starting the process of eliminating flood from the majority of the company s mobile home policies 
by the end of  the company anticipates that approximately of its policies will have flood coverage removed  which will dramatically reduce the company s exposure to loss due to flooding 
in  the company started a coastal strategy which eliminated approximately  policies in the coastal counties from maine to texas 
this program of coastal policy reduction was substantially completed by june  the company has further reduced its exposure to hurricane loss by not writing any significant amount of new business in florida since management has pursued the reduction of the company s earthquake exposure by non renewing  policies in california with units greater than  in value since attrition also has contributed to the reduction of earthquake exposure  pushing the total policy decline in california to approximately  since since july   the company s policies only provide earthquake coverage on an optional basis  which has reduced exposure to catastrophic loss due to earthquakes 
management will continue to take appropriate actions in the future where deemed necessary 
management is committed to controlling expenses and has aggressively managed the company s acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses 
all expense categories are closely monitored and employees are constantly challenged to develop ideas and programs to continually improve results 
these actions have helped reduce the company s expense ratio from a high of in to its current level of in the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits to define the applicable year instead of four 
the problem exists when time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year by nature  the insurance industry is highly dependent upon computer systems because of significant transaction volumes and a date dependency for many of its applications 
the company has done a comprehensive review of its computer programs to identify the systems that would be affected by the year problem 
the company has a comprehensive  written plan  which regularly is updated and monitored by technical personnel 
plan status is regularly reviewed by management of the company 
the company also has hired an outside consulting firm to assist in this conversion process and is half way through the modification of its computer programs to the four digit fields 
management also has reviewed its year exposure to third party customers  distributors  suppliers and banking institutions 
they have determined the exposure to be limited but are in the process of obtaining certification of compliance letters 
the company will continue to assess the impact of the year issue on the remainder of its computer based systems and applications throughout and the company s goal is to perform tests of its systems and applications during and and to have all systems and applications compliant with the century change by the middle of  allowing the remaining time to be used for validation and testing 
the company spent approximately million to remediate year issues in and expects that it will spend approximately million and million in and  respectively 
these costs primarily will consist of professional fees paid to third party providers of remedial services 
it is the company s policy to expense all costs associated with these systems changes 
the company also may invest in new or upgraded technology which has definable value lasting beyond in these instances  where year compliance is merely ancillary  the company may capitalize and depreciate such an asset over its estimated useful life 
based on currently available information  management does not presently anticipate that the costs to address the year issues will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial conditions  results of operations or liquidity 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates 
there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause differences include  but are not limited to  the ability of other companies on which the company s systems rely to modify or convert their systems to be year compliant  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes and similar uncertainties 
in conjunction with the new direct marketing of automobile and homeowners insurance  the company has invested in a new policy processing system that is being developed and is expected to be operational in the fall of the million cost incurred in connection with this system during was capitalized and will be expensed over the life of the system starting in the total cost of the project is currently estimated to be approximately million 
the company considers that the effects of inflation are unlikely to be a significant factor in the results of operations given the relatively short term nature of premiums receivable and expected loss payments from reserves for losses and loss expenses 
the anticipated effect of inflation is implicitly considered when estimating reserves for losses and loss expenses  product pricing and investment decisions 
the company engages an outside actuarial firm to attest to the adequacy of its carried property and casualty reserves 
this firm has rendered their opinion for the year ended december   and they attest to the adequacy of the company s held reserves 
the company is committed to maintaining adequate loss reserves and places a high priority on balance sheet integrity 
the company discontinued writing private credit insurance in  and established a reserve to cover anticipated losses from the run off of the product 
the experience in the run off of this business has been positive  and accordingly  management reduced the reserve by  in both and  and million in these reductions are not reflected in the underwriting results of the insurance operations  but are a component of the parent company and other operational results 
the majority of these policies will run off in management believes that the aggregate reserves for this discontinued product are adequate at december   but will continue to review and adjust such reserves as needed

the average maturity of investments is between five and six years  which provides adequate asset liability matching

since the inception of this buy back program  the company has repurchased  shares 
during  the company repurchased  of its shares  of which  were repurchased from employees who exercised stock options during the year 
after the adjustment for the three for one stock split in january  the total shares available under the authorization for the repurchase program is  shares 
the company will continue to evaluate the purchase of its common stock from excess capital 
at december   the company s capital structure consisted of  common shares outstanding  which reflects the company s three for one stock split payable on january  the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions on their ability to transfer funds to the parent company in the form of cash dividends  loans or advances without regulatory approval

investments after tax investment income decreased by in  after increasing by in and in the decline in and the relatively flat results for were primarily due to the impact of catastrophe loss payments and common stock buy backs on the company s cash flow and investable asset base in the first quarter of and for the entire year of declining interest rates also impacted the investment income results of and the increase in resulted from positive cash flow generated from the strong underwriting performance during that year

as opportunities become available  the company has and expects to continue the strategy of increasing its asset allocation to total return investments 
these investments consist of common and preferred stock as well as lower rated bonds and other assets that achieve equity like returns over a market cycle 
at december  the company held securities in its investment portfolio which were either unrated or less than investment grade  high yield corporate debt securities  including certain preferred stocks and limited partnerships 
these securities had a cost basis of million  with an aggregate market value of million and none of them individually exceeded million 
these securities have different risks than other investment grade securities 
risk of loss upon default by the borrower is greater with these investments than with other corporate or governmental debt securities because these securities are generally unsecured and are often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer 
these issuers usually have high levels of indebtedness and are more sensitive to adverse economic conditions than are investment grade issuers

no adjustments were made to the carrying values of these foreclosed assets during the company has no further foreclosed real estate  nor are any of its real estate related securities in default at december  in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the company has classified a portion of its fixed maturity investments and its equity securities into a category entitled securities available for sale which are adjusted to reflect market value 
due to the restrictive definition of assets qualifying to be categorized as held to maturity  most of the company s fixed investment securities are considered to be available for sale  and are therefore adjusted to reflect market values 
unrealized investment gains and losses on securities available for sale are credited or charged directly to stockholders equity net of applicable tax provisions or credits 
the net unrealized gain on securities available for sale was an million at december   and million at december  although the company has the general intent and ability to hold most of its fixed maturities to maturity  sales may be made from this category due to changes in market conditions  relative yields available  tax planning and asset liability management considerations 
since the company does not purchase fixed maturity investments with a view to resale  the available for sale classification does not denote a trading account 
at december   the company had million of its consolidated assets in cash and other short term investments 
income taxes in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  the company has recognized certain tax assets whose realization depends upon generating future taxable income
