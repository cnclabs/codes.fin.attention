item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
general the company operates on a week fiscal year ending on the sunday closest to june th 
this period is utilized because it closely coincides with the rice crop year in the southern united states and rice is the largest component of the company s business 
the company utilizes derivative financial instruments as hedges to manage a portion of its exposure to currency fluctuations related to inventory purchases 
these instruments qualify for hedge accounting treatment and  accordingly  gains and losses on these instruments are deferred and included in the basis of the inventory hedged 
the company enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge specific product commitments 
the contracts have varying maturities with none exceeding twelve months and are settled at maturity  based on rates agreed to at the inception of the contracts 
at june   the company had established bank lines available to purchase forward exchange contracts in the amount of million  of which million was outstanding 
gains and losses deferred in outstanding instruments at year end were immaterial 
as a matter of policy  the company does not engage in foreign currency speculation and does not hedge to protect the translated results of foreign operations or other economic exposures for which speculative accounting treatment of the hedging instrument would be required 
the company operates in various foreign countries and is therefore subject to currency fluctuations 
changes in the value of the united states dollar against these currencies will affect the company s results of operations and financial position 
when the united states dollar strengthens compared to other local currencies  the operating results of the company s foreign units translate into fewer united states dollars  thus decreasing the revenues and expenses of the company on a consolidated basis 
if the united states dollar weakens against the other relevant currencies  the opposite occurs 
the company s foreign units attempt to minimize the effects of currency risk by borrowing externally in the local currency and by hedging their limited purchases made in foreign currencies when that option is available 
as a matter of policy  the company does not engage in currency speculation 
changes in exchange rates historically have not materially impacted the company s net sales  costs or business practices and management expects this to continue 
inflationary conditions in the united states and europe have been moderate and have not had a material impact on the results of operations or financial position for the three years ended june  despite higher inflationary rates in central america  inflation has not had a material impact on the results of operations or financial position of the company s units located in that region because the company has generally been able to pass on cost increases to its customers

gross profit increased or million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  gross profit declined to from in the previous year 
the major factor contributing to the reduced gross profit percentage was a reduction in gross profit both in absolute terms and as a percentage of sales in the domestic rice business

despite increased sales in this segment  gross profit declined as a result of the change in sales mix

the company s international operations are financed internally or through borrowings in local currency without the benefit of parent company guarantees 
the company s foreign subsidiaries have a total of million in short term credit lines from local sources and at june   the subsidiaries have borrowed a total of million 
the company holds a portfolio of marketable securities with a market value of million at june   which is available to provide additional liquidity 
the company believes that the combination of its working capital  unused and available short term credit lines and cash flow from operations will provide it with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet its foreseeable needs 
impact of the year issue the company is currently working to resolve the potential impact of the year on the processing of date sensitive data by the company s computerized information systems 
the year is critical to these systems as many computer programs are written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  any of the company s computer applications that have date sensitive programs may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculation causing disruptions including but not limited to a temporary inability to process transactions  issue invoices  communicate with customers and financial institutions and update internal accounting systems 
if not corrected  such disruptions could have a significant impact on the company s operations 
the company has initiated a company wide program to prepare the company s computer systems and applications for the year based on present information  the company believes that it will be able to achieve year compliance through modification of some existing programs and the replacement of other programs with new programs that are already year compliant 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  and test software for year compliance 
the company plans to complete the year conversion project by july  the total project costs are presently estimated not to exceed million and will be expensed as incurred  unless new software is purchased in which case costs will be capitalized 
the company is taking steps to resolve year compliance issues that may be created by customers  suppliers and financial institutions with whom the company does business 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other entities will be converted timely 
a failure to convert by another entity could have a significant adverse effect on the company 
the costs of the year conversion project and the date on which the company plans to complete the project are based on management s best estimates  which were derived using numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could vary significantly from current estimates 
the company does not have a written contingency plan to address the issues that could arise should the company or any of its suppliers or customers not be prepared to accommodate year issues timely 
the company believes that in an emergency it could revert to the use of manual systems that do not rely on computers and could perform the minimum functions required to maintain the flow of goods and provide information reporting to maintain satisfactory control of the business 
should the company have to utilize manual systems  it is uncertain that it could maintain the same level of operations and this could have a material adverse impact on the business 
the company intends to maintain constant surveillance on this situation and will develop such contingency plans as are required by the changing environment 
euro conversion the company operates in europe through a subsidiary and two joint ventures in the united kingdom and belgium 
on january  many of the member countries of the european union are scheduled to establish fixed conversion rates between the existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
at this time  the united kingdom is not participating in this change 
however  the company s european operations do conduct business in certain of the participating member countries 
the company believes it is taking the necessary steps to accommodate this change and does not believe the euro conversion will have a significant impact on its operations 
forward looking statements the statements contained in this form k include forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities act of  as amended 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions  the company can give no assurance that these expectations will be achieved
