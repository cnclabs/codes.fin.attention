item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company acquires and operates primary care oriented multi specialty medical clinics and develops and manages ipas 
a substantial majority of the company s revenue in and was earned under service agreements with multi specialty clinics 
revenue earned under substantially all of the service agreements is equal to the net revenue of the clinics  less amounts retained by physician groups 
the service agreements contain financial incentives for the company to assist the physician groups in increasing clinic revenues and controlling expenses 
upon the acquisition by phycor of a clinic s operating assets  the affiliated physician group simultaneously enters into a long term service agreement with the company 
under the terms of the service agreement  the company provides the physician group with the equipment and facilities used in its medical practice  manages clinic operations  employs most of the clinic s non physician personnel  other than certain diagnostic technicians  and receives a service fee 
the affiliated physicians maintain full professional control over their medical practices  determine which physicians to hire or terminate and set their own standards of practice in order to promote high quality health care 
pursuant to its service agreements with physician groups  phycor manages all aspects of the clinic other than the provision of medical services  which is controlled by the physician groups 
at each clinic  a joint policy board equally comprised of physicians and phycor personnel focuses on strategic and operational planning  marketing  managed care arrangements and other major issues facing the clinic 
under substantially all of its service agreements  the company receives a service fee equal to the clinic expenses it has incurred plus a percentage of operating income of the clinic net clinic revenue less certain contractually agreed upon clinic expenses before physician distributions and  under all other service agreements except one described below  a percentage of net clinic revenue 
in  approximately of revenue from clinics was derived from contracts based on a percentage of clinic operating income  approximately of revenue from clinics was derived from contracts based on a percentage of net clinic revenue and approximately of revenue from clinics was derived from contracts based on a combination of a percentage of clinic operating income and net clinic revenue 
as clinic operating income improves  whether as a result of increased revenue or lower expenses  phycor s service fees increase 
under one service agreement  phycor s revenue is based on a flat fee  and it represented approximately of revenue from clinics in the company currently amortizes the goodwill and other intangible assets related to its service agreements over the periods during which the agreements are effective  ranging from to years 
the company recently has engaged in discussions with the staff of the securities and exchange commission the commission regarding the appropriate amortization period for goodwill and other intangible assets related to the company s service agreements 
the company has had discussions with the staff regarding the use of a year amortization period for such assets for all transactions to be entered into in the future 
there can be no assurance as to the outcome of the current discussions with the commission staff or the adoption by the company of this policy 
had this policy been in place for  the effect would have been an approximate reduction in net income before the nonrecurring charge discussed below in liquidity 
management expects a similar effect on net income would result based on its current preliminary internal estimates of intangible asset additions 
to increase clinic revenue  the company works with the affiliated physician groups to recruit additional physicians  merge other physicians practicing in the area into the affiliated physician groups  negotiate contracts with managed care organizations and provide additional ancillary services 
to reduce or control expenses  among other things  phycor utilizes national purchasing contracts for key items  reviews staffing levels to make sure they are appropriate and assists the physicians in developing more cost effective clinical practice patterns 
in november  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on eitf  application of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
to physician practice entities  which was passed in november  and relates primarily to the consolidation of physician practices controlled by a company 
the company has not consolidated the physician practices it manages as it does not have operating control as defined in eitf the company has increased its focus on the development of ipas to enable the company to provide services to a broader range of physician organizations  to enhance the operating performance of existing clinics and to further develop physician relationships 
the company develops ipas that include affiliated clinic physicians to enhance the clinics attractiveness as providers to managed care organizations 
fees earned from managing the ipas are based upon a percentage of revenue collected by the ipas and also upon a share of surplus  if any  of capitated revenue of the ipas 
in  approximately of the company s revenue was earned under ipa management agreements 
the table below indicates the number of clinics and physicians affiliated with the company and provides certain information with respect to the company s ipa operations at the end of the years indicated clinic operations number of affiliated clinics number of affiliated physicians     ipa operations number of markets number of physicians     number of commercial members     number of medicare members     information as of january  the table below indicates the payor mix of the aggregate net clinic revenue earned by the physician groups and ipas currently affiliated with the company 
year ended december  medicare medicaid managed care private payor and insurance includes hmo  ppo  medicare risk contracts and direct employer contracts  of which approximately two thirds of revenue was attributable to capitated contracts 
the payor mix varies from clinic to clinic and changes as acquisitions are made 
since  managed care revenue as a percentage of all revenue has increased with significant increases since relating to the management of ipas 
phycor believes that this trend will continue as a greater portion of the population in the company s markets joins managed care plans 
the company also believes that the revenue received from managed care plans will increasingly be in the form of capitation rather than fee for service contracts 
other changes in payor mix have resulted from the acquisition of clinics with payor mixes different from historical payor mixes experienced by the company s affiliated groups 
many of the payor contracts entered into on behalf of phycor managed ipas are based on capitated fee arrangements 
under capitation arrangements  health care providers bear the risk  subject to certain loss limits  that the aggregate costs of providing medical services to members will exceed the payments received 
the ipa management fees are based  in part  upon a share of the remaining portion  if any  of capitated amounts of revenues after payment of expenses 
agreements with payors also contain shared risk provisions under which the company and the ipa can earn additional compensation based on utilization of hospital services by members and may be required to bear a portion of any loss in connection with such shared risk provisions 
the profitability of the managed ipas is dependent upon the ability of the providers to effectively manage the per patient costs of providing medical services and the level of utilization of medical services 
the management fees are also based upon a percentage of revenue collected by the ipas 
through its service fees  the company also shares indirectly in capitation risk assumed by its affiliated physician groups 
during  phycor affiliated with multi specialty clinics and numerous smaller medical practices  and completed its previously announced merger with straub  located in honolulu  hawaii  adding million in assets 
the principal assets acquired were accounts receivable  property and equipment and service agreement costs  an intangible asset 
the consideration for the clinic acquisitions consisted of approximately cash  liabilities assumed and stock and convertible notes 
the cash portion of the consideration was funded by a combination of operating cash flow and borrowings under the company s bank credit facility 
property and equipment acquired consisted mostly of clinic operating equipment  although the company has purchased certain land and buildings 
service agreement costs are amortized over the life of the related service agreement  with recoverability assessed periodically 
in the third quarter of  phycor announced that it had signed a letter of intent with new york and presbyterian hospitals care network  inc to create and operate a regional managed care contracting network  which will include hospitals and ipas in new york city  northern new jersey and southern connecticut 
in december  the company announced that it had signed two separate agreements to purchase atlanta based first physician care  inc  a provider of practice management services  and seattle based carewise  inc  a nationally recognized leader in the consumer decision support industry 
both transactions  which are expected to be accounted for as pooling of interests  are expected to close in the second quarter of the company expects to issue approximately million shares of common stock in conjunction with these transactions 
results of operations the following table shows the percentage of net revenue represented by various expense categories reflected in the company s consolidated statements of income 
year ended december  net revenue operating expenses clinic salaries  wages and benefits clinic supplies purchased medical services other clinic expenses general corporate expenses rents and lease expense depreciation and amortization nonrecurring charge operating expenses earnings from operations interest income interest expense earnings before income taxes and minority interest income tax expense minority interest net earnings excluding the effect of the nonrecurring charge in  net operating expenses  earnings from operations  earnings before income taxes and minority interest  income tax expense and net earnings  as a percent of net revenue  would have been    and  respectively 
compared to net revenue increased from million for to billion for  an increase of 
net revenue from the service agreements and ipa markets in effect for both years increased million  or  in compared with same market growth resulted from the addition of new physicians  the expansion of ancillary services  and increases in patient volume and fees 
the remaining increase results from the addition of new clinic service agreements in and the timing of entering into new service agreements in during  most categories of operating expenses were relatively stable as a percentage of net revenue when compared to  despite the large increase in the dollar amounts resulting from acquisitions and clinic growth 
the decrease in clinic salaries  wages and benefits and other clinic expenses as a percentage of net revenue resulted from the acquisition of clinics with lower levels of these expenses compared to the existing base of clinics 
the increase in clinic supplies and rents and lease expense as a percentage of net revenue resulted from the acquisition of clinics with higher levels of these expenses compared to the existing base of clinics 
the addition of pharmacies at certain existing clinics and new clinics which operate pharmacies also resulted in increased clinic supplies expense as a percentage of net revenue 
while general corporate expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenue  the dollar amount of general corporate expenses increased as a result of the addition of corporate personnel to accommodate increased acquisition activity and to respond to increasing physician group needs for support in managed care negotiations  information systems implementation and clinical outcomes management programs 
the nonrecurring charge in relates to the asset revaluation of seven of the company s multi specialty clinics 
for a more detailed discussion of the nonrecurring charge  see see liquidity and capital resources 
the company s effective tax rate was approximately in and compared to net revenue increased from million for to million for  an increase of million  or 
net revenue from the service agreements in effect as of january  increased million  or  in same clinic growth resulted from the addition of new physicians  the expansion of ancillary services  increases in both patient volume and fees 
the remaining increase results from the addition of new clinic service agreements in and the timing of entering into new service agreements in during  most categories of operating expenses were relatively stable as a percentage of net revenue when compared to  despite the large increase in the dollar amounts resulting from acquisitions and clinic growth 
the increase in clinic salaries  wages and benefits resulted from the acquisition of clinics with higher levels of these expenses compared to the existing base of clinics and the addition of primary care physicians at existing clinics 
the ratio of staffing costs to net revenues is higher for primary care practices than for specialty care 
the reduction in purchased medical services as a percentage of net revenue resulted from the company s continuing efforts to reduce clinic operating costs by improving the productivity of non physician personnel and limiting payments for outside medical services 
while general corporate expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenue  the dollar amount of general corporate expenses increased as a result of the addition of corporate personnel to accommodate increased acquisition activity and to respond to increasing physician group needs for support in managed care negotiations  information systems implementation and clinical outcomes management programs 
income tax expense increased from the prior year as a result of the company s increased profitability 
the company s effective tax rate was approximately in summary of operations by quarter the following table presents unaudited quarterly operating results for and the company believes that all necessary adjustments have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the quarterly results when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations for any particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results of operations for a full year or predictive of future periods 
quarter ended quarter ended mar june sept dec mar june sept dec in thousands  except per share net revenue         earnings loss before taxes         net loss earnings         earnings loss per share diluted 







excluding the effect of nonrecurring charges  the company s earnings before taxes  net earnings and net earnings per share diluted for the fourth quarter of would have been approximately million  million and  respectively 
adjusted to reflect the three for two stock split effected june liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had million in working capital  up from million as of december  also  the company generated million of cash flow from operations in compared to million in at december   net accounts receivable of million amounted to days of net clinic revenue compared to million and days at the end of the prior year 
in the first quarter of  the company completed a public offering of  shares of its common stock at a price of per share 
net proceeds from the offering of approximately million were used to repay bank debt and accrued interest 
as a result of the issuance of common stock during  debt was of total capitalization at december   compared to at the end of in  million of convertible subordinated notes issued in connection with physician group asset acquisitions were converted into common stock 
these conversions  the issuance of common stock  option exercises and net earnings for resulted in an increase of million in shareholders equity compared to december  capital expenditures during totaled million 
the company is responsible for capital expenditures at its affiliated clinics under the terms of its service agreements 
the company expects to make approximately million in capital expenditures during effective january   the company completed its acquisition of north american 
the company paid million at closing and has made additional payments pursuant to an earn out formula during and  totaling million 
a final payment of million will be made pursuant to the earnout formula in a portion of the final payment will be paid in shares of the company s common stock 
in addition  deferred acquisition payments are payable to physician groups in the event such physician groups attain predetermined financial targets during established periods of time following the acquisitions 
if each group satisfied its applicable financial targets for the periods covered  the company would be required to pay an aggregate of approximately million of additional consideration over the next five years  of which a maximum of million would be payable during in the fourth quarter of  phycor recorded a nonrecurring pre tax charge to earnings of million related to the revaluation of assets of seven of the company s multi specialty clinics 
in addition  the company also announced that it expects to take an additional charge of approximately million in the first quarter of relating to these clinics that will be restructured or sold 
the restructured groups primarily represent first generation attempts at new group formations  and these charges address problems that developed in these markets 
the company has modified its approach to this type of market and the more recent new group formations have been more successful 
the company also announced that it expects to record a pre tax charge to earnings of approximately million in the first quarter of relating to its terminated merger with medpartners  inc this charge represents phycor s share of investment banking  legal  travel  accounting and other expenses incurred during the merger process 
in june  the company purchased a minority interest of approximately in pmc and manages pmc pursuant to a year administrative services agreement 
pmc develops and manages ipas and provides other services to physician organizations 
phycor acquired the remaining interests of pmc on march  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million paid in shares of the company s common stock 
phycor has been the subject of an audit by the internal revenue service irs covering the years through the irs has proposed adjustments relating to the timing of recognition for tax purposes of certain revenue and deductions relating to uncollectible accounts and the company s relationship with affiliated physician groups 
phycor disagrees with the positions asserted by the irs  including any recharacterization  and is vigorously contesting these proposed adjustments 
the company believes that any adjustments resulting from resolution of this disagreement would not affect reported net earnings of phycor  but would defer tax benefits and change the levels of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
for the years under audit  and potentially  for subsequent years  any such adjustments could result in material cash payments by the company 
phycor does not believe the resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations  although there can be no assurance as to the outcome of this matter 
in july  the company completed modifications to its bank credit facility  which included the revision of certain terms and condition and the addition of seven participating financial institutions 
the company s bank credit facility provides for a five year  million revolving line of credit for use by the company prior to july and a million day facility for acquisitions  working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate purposes 
the total drawn cost under the facility is either 
to 
above the applicable eurodollar rate or the agents base rate plus 
to 
per annum 
on october   the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to fix the interest rate on million of debt at for a two year period 
in march  the company obtained commitments from its bank group to expand the existing bank credit facility to a total of million 
the expanded facility  with terms similar to the existing facility  is expected to close in the second quarter of the company s current bank credit facility contains covenants which  among other things  require the company to maintain certain financial ratios and impose certain limitations or prohibitions on the company with respect to i the incurrence of certain indebtedness  ii the creation of security interests on the assets of the company  iii the payment of cash dividends on  and the redemption or repurchase of  securities of the company  iv investments and v acquisitions 
the company is required to obtain bank consent for an acquisition with an aggregate purchase price of million or more 
the company was in compliance with such covenants at december  phycor has assessed its practice management systems  managed care information systems  business information systems and other clinic systems for compliance with the year issue 
the company is in its normal process of standardizing the various systems utilized by its clinics and ipas 
this standardization includes implementation of year compliant systems 
the company has performed an assessment of its various clinics and ipas to identify which systems specifically require replacement or upgrade due to the year issue in order to ensure timely upgrade or installation 
the company believes it has a replacement strategy in place such that the year issue will not have a significant effect on its operations 
total capital costs to implement new systems and to address the year issue are expected to be less than million 
at march   the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and million available under its current bank credit facility 
the company believes that the combination of funds available under the company s anticipated expanded bank credit facility  together with cash reserves and cash flow from operations  should be sufficient to meet the company s current planned acquisition  expansion  capital expenditure and working capital needs through in addition  in order to provide the funds necessary for the continued pursuit of the company s long term expansion strategy  the company expects to continue to incur  from time to time  additional short term and long term indebtedness and to issue equity and debt securities  the availability and terms of which will depend upon market and other conditions 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to the company or that the expanded bank credit facility will be entered into 
risk factors this discussion also identifies important cautionary factors that could cause phycor s actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements of phycor and included herein or incorporated by reference 
in particular  forward looking statements including  but not limited to  those regarding future business prospects  the acquisition of additional clinics  the development of additional ipas  the adequacy of phycor s capital resources  the future profitability of capitated fee arrangements and other statements regarding trends relating to various revenue and expense items  could be affected by a number of risks and uncertainties including those described below 
no assurance of continued rapid growth phycor s continued growth will be primarily dependent upon its ability to achieve significant consolidation of multi specialty medical clinics  to sustain and enhance the profitability of those clinics and to develop and manage ipas 
the process of identifying suitable acquisition candidates and proposing  negotiating and implementing an economically feasible affiliation with a physician group or formation or management of a physician network is lengthy and complex 
clinic and physician network operations require intensive management in a dynamic marketplace increasingly subject to cost containment pressures 
there can be no assurance that phycor will be able to sustain its historically rapid rate of growth 
the success of phycor s strategy to develop and manage ipas is largely dependent upon its ability to form networks of physicians  to obtain favorable payor contracts  to manage and control costs and to realize economies of scale 
many of the agreements entered into by physicians participating in phycor managed ipas are not exclusive arrangements 
the physicians  therefore  could join competing networks or terminate their relationships with the ipas 
there can be no assurance that phycor will be successful in acquiring additional physician practice assets or ppms  establishing new ipa networks or maintaining relationships with affiliated physicians 
additional financings phycor s multi specialty medical clinic acquisition and expansion program and its ipa development and management plans require substantial capital resources 
the operations of existing clinics require ongoing capital expenditures for renovation and expansion and the addition of costly medical equipment and technology utilized in providing ancillary services 
phycor  in certain circumstances  has acquired real estate in connection with clinic acquisitions 
phycor will require additional financing for the development of additional ipas and expansion and management of existing ipas 
phycor expects that its capital needs over the next several years will exceed capital generated from operations 
phycor plans to incur indebtedness and to issue  from time to time  additional debt or equity securities  including the issuance of phycor common stock or convertible notes in connection with acquisitions 
phycor s bank credit facility requires the lenders consent for borrowings in connection with the acquisition of certain clinic assets 
there can be no assurance that sufficient financing will be available on terms satisfactory to phycor or at all 
competition the business of providing health care related services is highly competitive 
many companies  including professionally managed ppm companies like phycor have been organized to pursue the acquisition of medical clinics  manage such clinics  employ clinic physicians or provide services to ipas 
large hospitals  other multi specialty clinics and health care companies hmos and insurance companies are also involved in activities similar to those of phycor 
some of these competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater resources than phycor 
there can be no assurance that phycor will be able to compete effectively  that additional competitors will not enter the market  or that such competition will not make it more difficult to acquire the assets of multi specialty clinics on terms beneficial to phycor 
dependence on affiliated physicians substantially all of phycor s revenue is derived from service or management agreements with phycor s affiliated clinics  the loss of certain of which could have a material adverse effect on phycor as a result of the loss of revenue from such agreements and the loss of any funds advanced by phycor to cover expenses of such clinics 
in addition  any material decline in revenue by phycor s affiliated physician groups  whether as a result of physicians leaving the affiliated physician groups or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on phycor 
risks associated with managed care and capitation  reliance on physician networks many of the payor contracts entered into on behalf of phycor managed ipas are based on capitated fee arrangements 
under capitation arrangements  health care providers bear the risk  subject to certain loss limits  that the aggregate costs of providing medical services to the members will exceed the premiums received 
the ipa management fees are based  in part  upon a share of the remaining portion  if any  of capitated amounts of revenue 
some agreements with payors also contain shared risk provisions under which the company and ipa can earn additional compensation and may be required to bear a portion of any loss in connection with such shared risk provisions based on utilization of hospital services by members 
any such losses could have a material adverse effect on phycor 
the profitability of a capitated fee arrangement is dependent upon the ability of the providers to effectively manage the per patient costs of providing medical services and the level of utilization of medical services 
the management fees are also based upon a percentage of revenue collected by the ipa 
any loss of revenue by the ipas as a result of losing affiliated physicians  the termination of third party payor contracts or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on management fees derived by phycor 
managed care providers and management entities such as phycor are increasingly subject to liability claims arising from utilization management  provider compensation arrangements and other activities designed to control costs by reducing services 
a successful claim on this basis against phycor or an affiliated clinic or ipa could have a material adverse effect on phycor 
risks of changes in payment for medical services the united states congress and many state legislatures routinely consider proposals to reform or modify the health care system  including measures that would control health care spending  convert all or a portion of government reimbursement programs to managed care arrangements and reduce spending for medicare and state health programs 
these measures can affect a health care company s cost of doing business and contractual relationships 
for example  recent developments that affect phycor s activities include i federal legislation requiring a health plan to continue coverage for individuals who are no longer eligible for group health benefits and prohibiting the use of pre existing condition exclusions that limit the scope of coverage  ii a health care financing administration policy prohibiting restrictions in medicare risk hmo plans on a physician s recommendation of other health plans and treatment options to patients  and iii regulations imposing restrictions on physician incentive provisions in physician provider agreements 
there can be no assurance that such legislation  programs and other regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on phycor 
the profitability of phycor may be adversely affected by medicare and medicaid regulations  cost containment decisions of third party payors and other payment factors over which phycor has no control 
the federal medicare program has undergone significant legislative and regulatory changes in the reimbursement and fraud and abuse areas  including the adoption of the resource based relative value scale rbrvs schedule for physician compensation under medicare  which may continue to have a negative impact on phycor s revenue 
efforts to control the cost of health care services are increasing 
many of phycor s physician groups are becoming affiliated with provider networks  managed care organizations and other organized health care systems  which often provide fixed fee schedules or capitation payment arrangements that are lower than standard charges 
future profitability in the changing health care environment  with differing methods of payment for medical services  is likely to be affected significantly by management of health care costs  pricing of services and agreements with payors 
because phycor derives its revenues from the revenues generated by its affiliated physician groups and from managed ipas  further reductions in payments to physicians generally or other changes in payment for health care services could have a material adverse effect on phycor 
additional regulatory risks the health care industry and physicians medical practices are highly regulated at the state and federal levels 
at the state level  all state laws restrict the unlicensed practice of medicine  and many states also prohibit the splitting or sharing of fees with nonphysician entities and the enforcement of noncompetition agreements against physicians 
furthermore  most state fee splitting laws provide that it is a violation only if a physician shares fees with a referral source 
phycor is not a referral source for its managed groups  and therefore the fee splitting laws in most states should not restrict the payment of a management fee by the physician groups to phycor 
many states also prohibit the corporate practice of medicine by an unlicensed corporation or other nonphysician entity that employs physicians 
currently  phycor merely manages physician groups  and the physicians continued to be employed at the group level by professional associations or corporations  which are specifically authorized under most state laws to employ physicians 
upon consummation of the fpc transaction  however  subsidiaries of phycor will directly employ physicians in the states of florida and georgia 
additionally  the florida board of medicine has interpreted the florida fee splitting law very broadly so as to arguably include the payment of any percentage based management fee  even to a management company that does not refer patients to a managed group 
phycor is affiliated with five physician groups in florida  the service agreements with which provide for percentage based management fees 
the florida board of medicine decision has been stayed pending judicial interpretation of the decision 
because of the structure of the relationships of phycor with its affiliated physician groups and managed ipas  and because of the recent broad fee splitting interpretation in the state of florida  there can be no assurance that review of phycor s business by courts or health care  or other regulatory authorities will not result in determinations that could adversely affect the financial condition or results of operations of phycor 
if for any reason phycor were found to have violated the corporate practice of medicine or fee splitting statutes  possible consequences could include revocation or suspension of the physicians license  resulting in lowered revenue to phycor 
courts could also refuse to uphold the contracts between phycor and its managed physicians on the grounds that phycor was engaging in the unlicensed practice of medicine and that therefore its contracts were invalid 
on the federal level  federal law prohibits the offer  payment  solicitation  or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for the referral of  or the arranging for the referral of  medicare or other federal or state health program patients or patient care opportunities  or in return for the purchase  lease or order of items or services that are covered by medicare or other federal or state health programs 
in addition  federal law prohibits physicians with certain financial relationships with health care providers from referring certain types of medicare or medicaid reimbursed designated health services to those providers unless the referral fits within an exception to the law 
one of the exceptions that is used most often requires that physician groups be included within a definition of group practice in order to be permitted to make referrals within the group 
federal antitrust laws also prohibit conduct that may result in price fixing or other anticompetitive conduct 
the phycor arrangements have been carefully structured so that the physician groups being managed fit within the definition of group practice  and all referrals from those physicians to ancillary centers are structured to fit within an applicable exception to federal law 
in addition  phycor does not make or influence referrals to its managed or employed physicians  and the compensation received by phycor is not directly related to any referral levels between the parties 
nevertheless  because of the structure of the relationships of phycor with its affiliated physician groups and managed ipas  there can be no assurance that review of phycor s business by courts or healthcare  tax  regulatory authorities will not result in determinations that could adversely affect the financial condition or results of operations of phycor  or that the health care regulatory environment will not change in the manner that would restrict phycor s existing operations or limit the expansion of phycor s business or otherwise adversely affect phycor 
in addition to civil and  in some cases  criminal penalties for violation of medicare and medicaid statutes  violators of these statutes may be excluded from further participation in medicare or state health care programs 
increased government scrutiny of health care arrangements there is increasing scrutiny by law enforcement authorities  the office of inspector general oig of the department of health and human services dhhs  the courts  and the united states congress of arrangements between health care providers and potential referral sources to ensure that the arrangements are not designed as a mechanism to exchange remuneration for patient care referrals and opportunities 
investigators have also demonstrated a willingness to look behind the documents evidencing a business transaction to determine the underlying purpose of payments between health care providers and potential referral sources 
enforcement actions have increased as evidenced by recent highly publicized enforcement investigations of certain hospital activities 
although  to its knowledge phycor is not currently the subject of any investigation which is likely to have a material adverse effect on their respective businesses  there can be no assurance that they will not be the subject of investigations or inquiries in the future 
risks associated with straub transaction in january  phycor consummated its merger with straub  an integrated health care system with a physician multi specialty clinic and bed acute care hospital located in honolulu  hawaii 
in connection with the transaction with straub  phycor agreed to provide certain management services to both a physician group practice and a hospital owned by the group 
because the hospital is subject to extensive regulation and because hospital management companies have  in some instances  been viewed as referral sources by federal regulatory agencies  the relationship between phycor and the physician group could come under increased scrutiny under the medicare fraud and abuse law 
tax audit phycor has been subject to an audit by the irs covering the years through the irs has proposed adjustments relating to the timing of recognition for tax purposes of certain revenue and deductions relating to uncollectible accounts and phycor s relationship with affiliated physician groups 
phycor disagrees with the positions asserted by the irs including any recharacterization and is vigorously contesting these proposed adjustments 
phycor believes that any adjustments resulting from resolution of this disagreement would not affect reported net earnings of phycor but would defer tax benefits and change the levels of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
for the years under audit and  potentially  for subsequent years  any such adjustments could result in material cash payments by phycor 
phycor does not believe the resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition  although there can be no assurance as to the outcome of this matter 
applicability of insurance regulations phycor s managed ipas enter into contracts and joint ventures with licensed insurance companies  such as hmos  whereby the ipas may be paid on a capitated fee basis 
under capitation arrangements  health care providers bear the risk  subject to certain loss limits  that the aggregate costs of providing medical services to members will exceed the premiums received 
to the extent that the ipas subcontract with physicians or other providers for those physicians or other providers to provide services on a fee for service basis  the managed ipas may be deemed to be in the business of insurance  and thus  subject to a variety of regulatory and licensing requirements applicable to insurance companies or hmos resulting in increased costs to the managed ipas  and corresponding lower revenue to phycor 
in connection with multi specialty medical clinic acquisitions  phycor has and may continue to acquire hmos previously affiliated with such clinics 
the hmo industry is highly regulated at the state level and is highly competitive 
additionally  the hmo industry has been subject to numerous legislative initiatives within the past several years  including initiatives that would pose additional liabilities on hmos for patient malpractice  thereby increasing costs to hmos  which would result in correspondingly lower revenue to phycor 
there can be no assurance that developments in any of these areas will not have an adverse effect on phycor s wholly owned hmos or on hmos in which phycor has a partial ownership interest or other financial involvement 
risks inherent in provision of medical services the physician groups with which phycor affiliates and the physicians participating in networks developed and managed by phycor are involved in the delivery of medical services to the public and  therefore  are exposed to the risk of professional liability claims 
claims of this nature  if successful  could result in substantial damage awards to the claimants which may exceed the limits of any applicable insurance coverage 
insurance against losses related to claims of this type can be expensive and varies widely from state to state 
phycor does not control the practice of medicine by affiliated physicians or the compliance with certain regulatory and other requirements directly applicable to physicians  physician networks and physician groups 
phycor is indemnified under its service agreements for claims against the physician groups  maintains liability insurance for itself and negotiates liability insurance for the physicians affiliated with its clinics and under its management agreements for claims against the ipas and physician members 
successful malpractice claims asserted against the physician groups  the managed ipas or phycor  however  could have a material adverse effect on phycor 
moreover  phycor may in the future acquire entities  such as other ppms that directly employ physicians 
the acquisition of such companies would subject phycor to increased risk of malpractice liability  as well as increased scrutiny under healthcare regulations and laws 
anti takeover considerations phycor is authorized to issue up to  shares of preferred stock  the rights of which may be fixed by the board of directors 
in february  the board of directors approved the adoption of a shareholder rights plan the phycor rights plan 
the phycor rights plan is intended to encourage potential acquirers to negotiate with phycor s board of directors and to discourage coercive  discriminatory and unfair proposals 
phycor s stock incentive plans provide for the acceleration of the vesting of options in the event of a change in control 
the phycor charter provides for the classification of its board of directors into three classes  with each class of directors serving staggered terms of three years 
provisions in the executive officers employment agreements provide for post termination compensation  including payment of certain of the executive officers salaries for months  following a change in control 
most physician groups may terminate their service agreements with phycor in certain events  including a change in control of phycor which is not approved by a majority of phycor s board of directors 
a change in control of phycor also constitutes an event of default under phycor s bank credit facility 
the foregoing matters may  together or separately  have the effect of discouraging or making more difficult an acquisition or change of control of phycor
