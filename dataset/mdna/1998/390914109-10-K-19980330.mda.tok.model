when thrift certificates were purchased by customers  bvc reserved the right to repurchase the certificates at any time upon thirty days notice 
utilizing this call provision  bvc redeemed the higher cost component higher than bvb s incremental borrowing cost of these deposits at face value approximately million as of december  the remainder of the bvc customer deposits which were lower in cost than bvb s incremental borrowing cost were sold to bvb in june sale and securitization of motor vehicle loan portfolio in january  bvc sold million of its motor vehicle loan portfolio to bvsc  a delaware corporation formed for the purpose of issuing asset backed securities through a trust 
the motor vehicle loan portfolio was recorded at its fair value upon acquisition assuming that such loans would be securitized and sold

during  bvb discontinued its single family mortgage loan originations 
the company believes that income property lending affords an opportunity to receive interest income at yields higher than those obtainable from single 
family lending 
nevertheless  loans on income properties  particularly nonresidential properties  generally present a higher risk than do single family residential loans due to the sensitivity of the underlying property to changes in economic conditions 
management takes such risks into account when it establishes the loan rates  underwriting standards  loss allowances and decisions regarding portfolio mix 
arms comprise a significant portion of bvb s loan portfolio 
the interest rates on arms may periodically rise or fall generally based on monthly or semi annual adjustment periods in accordance with an independent index

the company defines nonperforming loans as loans days or more delinquent excluding accruing loans delinquent days or more and loans less than days delinquent designated as nonperforming when the company determines that the full collection of principal and or interest is doubtful 
nonperforming assets are placed on nonaccrual status 
troubled debt restructurings tdrs are real estate loans that have been modified due to borrower financial difficulties to allow a stated interest rate and or a monthly payment rate lower than those prevailing in the market

in determining the necessary level of the allowance for loan losses  management considers prevailing and anticipated economic conditions  historical loss experience  the levels of classified  nonperforming and delinquent assets  weighting by property type  loan portfolio trends and other factors 
the allowance for losses at december  was million as compared with million at december  including approximately million related to loans held for sale and million at december  the increase in the allowance over prior years was due to a combination of factors including reserves for the commercial finance platform acquired effective april  the expansion of the consumer finance platform and approximately million in reserves established in connection with the million home equity portfolio purchased in august the allowance for losses as a percentage of npas  gross loans and total assets is summarized as follows as of the dates indicated allowance for losses as a percentage of specified assets december  december  december  dollars in thousands assets percent assets percent assets percent nonperforming assets    gross loans    total assets    the changes in the allowance for losses on loans are summarized as follows for the years indicated year ended december  dollars in thousands beginning balance      reserves related to acquisitions   charge offs real estate and other      motor vehicle  commercial  recoveries real estate and other   motor vehicle commercial net charge offs      provision for loan losses      ending balance      allowance for loans by category real estate and other      motor vehicle   commercial  total      the consumer finance platform was created with the acquisitions of bvc in june and ultra in october  and the commercial finance platform was created with the acquisition of cgc in april management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover estimated losses in its asset portfolios  although there can be no assurance in this regard 
future adjustments may be necessary and earnings could be significantly adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making such determinations 
management will continue to monitor the adequacy of the allowance for losses related to problem assets 
management monitors the impact of the economic environment on its lending activities on a periodic basis 
if real estate markets weaken in future periods  no assurance can be given that the company s future loss experience will approximate its current estimates 
in addition  various regulatory agencies review the company s allowance for losses as an integral part of their examination process 
such agencies may require the company to recognize additions to this allowance based on their judgment relating to information available to them at the time of their examination

throughout and  management continued to emphasize the development and marketing of new products and as a result has successfully increased its percentage of transaction accounts in relation to total retail deposits which has contributed to lower cost of funds

both statements are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with earlier application permitted 
impact of inflation and changing prices the company s consolidated financial statements presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time  due to the fact that almost all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset and liability management the objective of the company s asset liability management activities is to improve earnings by adjusting the type and mix of assets and liabilities to effectively address changing conditions and risks 
through overall management of its balance sheet and by controlling various risks  the company seeks to optimize its financial returns within safe and sound parameters 
the company s operating strategies for attaining this objective include 
managing net interest margin through appropriate risk return pricing of assets and liabilities 

increasing retail deposits as a percentage of interest bearing liabilities and reducing the company s cost of funds 

utilizing the company s strong capital position to boost the earnings power through acquisition of quality assets with higher risk adjusted yields 

controlling noninterest expense and enhancing noninterest income  utilizing improved information systems to facilitate the analysis of the profitability of individual business units and products 

utilizing interest rate swap agreements and other hedging strategies to reduce exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 

enhancing internal analysis capability for measuring  evaluating and monitoring risk 
interest rate risk financial institutions are subject to interest rate risk to the degree that interest bearing liabilities reprice or mature on a different basis and at different times than interest earning assets 
the company s strategy has been to reduce the sensitivity of its earnings to interest rate fluctuations by more closely matching the effective maturities or repricing characteristics of its assets and liabilities 
certain assets and liabilities  however  may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
further  interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate prior to changes in market interest rates  while rates on other types may lag behind 
additionally  certain assets  such as arms  have features  including payment and rate caps  which restrict changes in their interest rates 
the company considers the anticipated effects of these factors when implementing its interest rate risk management objectives 
the company pursues balance sheet strategies that should  in the long run  mitigate its exposure to rising interest rates 
the company also considers other strategies to minimize the variability of the net interest margin including off balance sheet activities 
the company has initiated numerous actions which significantly reduced the company s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
these actions are discussed as follows 
interest rate swaps the company uses interest rate swap agreements to reduce the interest rate fluctuation risk related to certain assets and liabilities 
interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying notional amounts 
at december  and  the company was party to interest rate swap agreements with notional principal amounts of million and million  respectively  which involve the receipt of floating interest rates based on month libor and payment of fixed interest rates on the underlying notional amounts 
during the fourth quarter of  the company prepaid million of its short term high cost borrowings 
in addition  the company committed to prepay another million of its short term high cost borrowings in february as a result  the company incurred a prepayment charge of million net of applicable income taxes 
in conjunction with the prepayment of these borrowings  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements with notional principal amounts of million 
the impact of these actions was a reduction of the company s interest rate risk exposure by prepaying its short term high cost borrowings and replacing the prepayments with short term lower cost borrowings 
the interest rate swap agreements were used to provide interest rate risk protection for the short term borrowings by matching the floating interest rate characteristics and lengthening their maturities 
sale of mbs during and the company sold million and million of fixed rate mbs 
the purpose of the sales was to reduce the company s exposure to interest rate increases 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of the company reclassified million of its mbs from held to maturity to available for sale as a result of adopting the implementation guide to sfas this reclassification allowed the company to position these securities for potential sale  which assisted in the reduction of its interest rate risk exposure without tainting its remaining held to maturity portfolio 
hedging issuance of subordinated debt during  the company entered into million in treasury rate lock agreements to hedge the anticipated issuance of subordinated debt 
these agreements guaranteed a stated rate of interest for a stated period of time and the company paid the difference between the lock rate and the effective treasury rate on the settlement date 
in conjunction with the treasury rate lock agreements  approximately  was deferred and recognized as an adjustment of interest expense over the life of the subordinated debt 
hedging auto loans pending securitization as discussed elsewhere herein  in conjunction with the decision to sell bvc s auto loans and their subsequent securitization by bvsc  management entered into a short sale of treasury securities that materially insulated the purchase accounting valuations from movements in interest rates 
the short sale transaction was paired off in december with a loss of  recorded as a loss on securities 
at december   a treasury rate lock transaction with a notional principal amount of million was entered into to hedge the auto loans pending sale by bvc and securitization by bvsc 
interest rate sensitivity the company s interest rate risk policies are established and monitored by its asset liability committee alco 
the alco reviews the sensitivity of the company s net interest income and market value of equity to interest rate changes 
the objective of the company s alco activities is to improve earnings by adjusting the types of assets and liabilities to effectively address changing conditions and risks 
management believes that its asset liability activities have improved earnings within safe and sound parameters 
in measuring interest rate sensitivity  the company uses simulation modeling to estimate the potential effects of movements in interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity analysis measures the company s interest rate risk by computing estimated market value of equity mve based on the net present value of cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
mve is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities  with adjustments made for off balance sheet items 
this analysis assesses the risk of loss in market risk sensitive instruments in the event of a sudden and sustained to basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates 
the following table presents bvb s projected change in mve  with and without interest rate swaps  for the various basis points bp rate shock levels at december  all market risk sensitive instruments presented in this table are held to maturity or available for sale 
the company has no trading securities 
changes in market value of equity projected effect bp bp bp bp mve without swaps     mve with swaps     impact of swaps     changes in market value of equity projected effect bp bp bp bp mve without swaps     mve with swaps     impact of swaps     the change in mve as a percentage of the present value of assets from an immediate bp increase in interest rates was and at december  and  respectively 
the computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and deposit decay  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the company may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of mve 
actual values may differ from those projections set forth in the table  should market conditions vary from assumptions used in the preparation of the table 
to measure the company s interest rate sensitivity  a cumulative gap measure can also be used to assess the impact of potential changes in interest rates on net interest income 
the repricing gap represents the net position of assets and liabilities subject to repricing in specified time periods 
assets and liabilities are categorized according to the expected repricing time frames based on management s judgment 
a cumulative gap measure alone cannot be used to evaluate interest rate sensitivity because interest rate changes do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously 
the following table sets forth information regarding asset and liability repricing for the company as of december  repricing period under over over over one one to three three to five five year years years years total dollars in thousands assets cash and investments    loans and mortgage backed securities      total interest rate sensitive assets      liabilities deposits transaction accounts   certificates of deposit     borrowings      total interest rate sensitive liabilities      repricing gap positive negative before impact of interest rate swaps      impact of interest rate swaps     cumulative repricing gap positive negative     based on assumed annual prepayment and amortization rates which approximate the company s historical experience
