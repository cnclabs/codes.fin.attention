the company estimates the reduction in operating income from the year to year strengthening of the us dollar versus the belgian franc to be approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
net sales 
consolidated net sales decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  a decrease of million 
fiscal sales were adversely affected by the large decrease in the value of the belgian franc compared to the us dollar in fiscal without the effect of the exchange rate difference  fiscal sales would have increased by million or approximately 
on a us dollar basis  sales from european operations decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  a decrease of million 
expressed in the local european reporting currency belgian francs  fiscal sales increased by  or the us constant dollar equivalent of million  from fiscal  however  the increase was more than offset by a million exchange rate difference 
despite the effect of the strong us dollar on reported sales  europe s local results were much improved over the prior year 
sales of hardside products were above the prior year due primarily to the success of the new oyster ii product 
sales of softside products were above the prior year because of strong traditional softside luggage sales  the new trunk co product line  and strong computer and other softside business case lines 
sales in most european countries increased over the prior year  with the exceptions of germany and belgium  where sales were down approximately from fiscal sales from the americas operations increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  an increase of million or 
the increase was largely due to an increase in us retail sales of million or from the prior year 
comparable store sales increased by from fiscal and the number of stores open increased from at january  to at january  the company has rapidly expanded the number of retail locations during the past two fiscal years which  along with the increase in comparable store sales growth  contributed to the growth in fiscal sales over fiscal sales 
the company does not expect to continue the rate of growth in retail store openings in fiscal and therefore will not sustain the level of retail sales growth achieved in fiscal us wholesale revenues of million were less than the prior year by million  or 
us wholesale sales decreased due to market disruptions caused by the adverse impact of higher pricing strategies  various forms of cross distribution channel selling  dealer bankruptcies  and product availability problems associated with forecasting and production issues 
the company has addressed these issues by focusing on traditional disciplined channel management and strategic pricing which targets critical retailer price points  and is working on a long term resolution of forecasting and production issues 
although the company is taking these corrective actions  it expects sales in the us wholesale division to continue to be negatively impacted by the aforementioned factors through at least the first two quarters of fiscal sales from other americas operations  including mexico  canada and latin america  were less than the prior year by an aggregate of million 
the decrease in the other americas countries was caused primarily by a decline in canadian sales caused by issues related to product standardization requirements which have been modified subsequent to january  sales from international operations decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  a decrease of million 
product sales from export and emerging markets decreased by million from fiscal during fiscal the company moved export responsibility for the middle east from the americas to europe resulting in a decrease in sales classified as international operations 
export sales from the us to asia have been moved to the company s subsidiaries in singapore  hong kong  and south korea entities which were formerly the company s regional distributors 
transition issues resulting from the formation of the joint ventures and the economic problems in asia resulted in decreased sales in this region 
sales in india were million for fiscal samsonite products were introduced to the indian market through the new indian manufacturing and distribution joint venture which completed construction and began operations in april royalties from global licensing operations decreased by million from the prior year  million of the difference occurred largely because million of revenues were realized in fiscal from a single license sale transaction while fiscal included approximately million from two separate license sales 
gross profit 
consolidated gross profit for fiscal increased from fiscal by million 
gross margin increased by percentage points  from in fiscal to in fiscal gross margins from european operations increased by percentage points  from in fiscal to in fiscal the improvement is due to price increases in selected product lines and lower costs from standardized global production sources 
gross margins for the americas operations increased percentage points from in fiscal to in fiscal us wholesale margins increased from to  primarily as a result of price increases on product sales to both trade customers and the company s retail division and product cost improvements from global sourcing and product design improvements 
the increase in gross margins was achieved despite negative production variances incurred during the last half of fiscal of approximately million 
margins in the americas also benefited from a higher mix of retail versus wholesale sales compared to the prior year 
the company intends to pursue a different marketing and pricing strategy in fiscal and expects to roll back certain prices approximately to to conform to previously successful pricing strategies and make corresponding reductions in the various co op advertising and sales promotions costs 
thus  while gross profit margins may decline somewhat from fiscal levels  the company believes this strategy will stimulate sales over the long term and achieve an increased level of operating profit margin percentages from us wholesale sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a 
consolidated sg a increased by million from fiscal to fiscal as a percent of sales  sg a was in fiscal and in fiscal sg a for european operations decreased by million from fiscal to fiscal the exchange rate difference caused sg a to decrease by million 
the remaining increase of million was due primarily to higher variable selling expenses of million related to the higher sales levels  higher advertising expenses of million and various other net increases of million 
sg a for the americas operations  including worldwide corporate headquarters  increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal sg a related to us wholesale operations was approximately equal to fiscal in fiscal  us wholesale price increases and the relatively high rate of new product introductions were supported by increased co op advertising allowances and other sales promotion credits given to customers  particularly during the second half of fiscal the company is modifying this strategy in fiscal by reducing prices from to on certain products to better target critical retailer and competitive price points 
the company will make corresponding reductions in co op advertising allowances and sales promotion costs 
the company believes this strategy will better stimulate sales over the long term and result in an increased level of operating profit margin  albeit with lower gross profit margins and lower selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a related to us retail operations increased by million because of an increase in the number of stores open and increased sales volume 
as a percent of sales  retail sg a decreased from of sales in fiscal to of sales in fiscal sg a for other americas operations increased by million primarily because of a new brazilian joint venture 
corporate sg a decreased by million from the prior year due primarily to expenses incurred in the prior year related to expenses associated with a restructuring and changing organization structure in fiscal sg a for international operations increased by million from fiscal due to the addition of new joint venture subsidiaries in the far east and startup of operations in india  net of various cost savings from the reorganization of export operations from the us to europe and the far east
