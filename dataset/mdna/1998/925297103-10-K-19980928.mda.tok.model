versar s results of operations include the financial results that are part of the continuing operations of the company 
in may  versar acquired a majority equity interest in smc and  thereafter in october  the remaining outstanding equity 
following its acquisition  smc s engineering  design and construction services and management services segments failed to perform in accordance with the expectations of versar s management due to significant business shortfalls in these segments 
in september  versar s board of directors authorized management to discontinue the operations of science management corporation constituting the engineering  design and construction services and management services segments of versar 
therefore  results of operations of smc s two segments have been netted together and presented on one line  as a loss from discontinued operations 
the following discussion relates to continuing operations only  unless specifically noted 
versar s gross revenues from continuing operations for fiscal year totaled  or  above fiscal year gross revenue of  gross revenue for fiscal year was  above that reported in the increase in versar s gross revenue in fiscal year was due to five months of revenue from the acquisition of the greenwood partnership tgp of  and the remaining balance of the increase was with versar s base business

direct costs of services and overhead include the cost to versar of direct and overhead staff  including recoverable overhead costs and unallowable costs that are directly attributable to overhead 
the percentage of these costs to net service revenue increased to in compared to in and in the increase is due to operating losses of eims software business and valuadd municipal operations of  lower labor multipliers in tgp and lower margins on existing projects than versar s base business 
selling  general and administrative expenses approximated of net service revenue in  compared to in and in the decrease in fiscal years and are attributable to the higher net service revenue  while the corporate costs for the company were reduced

the company s decision to shut down the valuadd operations is a result of significant business shortfalls in the valuadd operations 
operating income for was  a decrease of  over fiscal year the decrease is primarily due to the special charge as mentioned above and the  of operating losses on eims and valuadd operations  which were closed in fiscal year interest expense during was  an increase of  from the increase is due to the cost of financing for the acquisition of smc of approximately  versar s income tax benefit for fiscal year was  compared to a tax expense of  in fiscal year due to the losses in the current fiscal year and the non deductible goodwill from smc  the company increased its valuation on deferred tax assets until the earnings improve to ensure the utilization of the tax assets

year certain computer programs have been written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  which could result in the computer recognizing a date using as the year rather than the year this  in turn  could result in major system failures and in miscalculations  and is generally referred to as the year problem 
on august   the company s board of directors adopted a comprehensive strategy for achieving year compliance program for versar and its subsidiaries 
subsequently  management has begun to implement the eight step program to identify both internally and externally the extent of any year problem  the cost to the company to mitigate any year effects and identify any significant client or subcontractor compliance issues 
among other things  versar is in the process of evaluating the different options that are available to upgrade the company s existing data  business processing and financial reporting software applications to be year compliant 
presently  versar does not believe that year compliance will result in any material investments  nor does versar have any information that the year problem will have material adverse effects on the business operations or financial performance of versar 
in addition  versar is not aware of any year problems of its customers  suppliers or network affiliates that will have a material adverse effect on the business  operations or financial performance of versar 
however  the implementation of our in house and outside survey has just begun  so there can be no assurance that the year problem will not adversely affect versar and its business 
it is expected to cost between  to  versar expects that the company will be in year compliance by june
