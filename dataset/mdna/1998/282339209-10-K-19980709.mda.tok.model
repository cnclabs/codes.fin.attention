item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  other expense income for further discussion 
acquisition and joint venture risks 
the company expects to pursue acquisition and joint venture opportunities to be able to introduce certain of the enhanced communications services it is proposing to offer 
this is expected to place significant administrative  technical and financial demands on the company s systems  procedures and controls 
acquisitions also involve numerous additional risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  services  products and personnel of the acquired company  the diversion of the company s management s attention from other business concerns  entry into markets in which the company has little or no direct prior experience and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
acquisitions and joint ventures also will require funding  which may necessitate the raising of additional financing 
expected benefits from future acquisitions  if any  may not be fully realized or realized within the expected time frame  revenues following future acquisitions may be lower than expected  and operating costs or customer loss and business disruption following future acquisitions  if any  may be greater than expected  and costs or difficulties related to the integration of the businesses  if any  that may be acquired by the company may be greater than expected 
future acquisitions by the company may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt  the assumption of known and unknown liabilities  the write off of software development costs and the amortization of expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and earnings per share 
dependence on carriers and others for transmission services 
the company does not own any telecommunications facilities and therefore depends on telecommunications carriers for transmission of its long distance calls 
these long distance telecommunication services generally are procured pursuant to strategic arrangements with the carriers owning such facilities or more common commercial arrangements for the supply of transmissions capacity 
the company s ability to operate its business profitably will depend  in part  on its ability to continue to obtain transmission services on favorable terms from long distance carriers 
the company believes that as providers add new and enhanced communications services  cost will re emerge as a key criterion for distinguishing between services  and the company therefore will need to keep reducing its transmission costs and pursue low cost alternative routing technologies 
failure to obtain long distance transmission services at favorable rates could result in losses on particular services or over particular routes  and could lead to a loss of customers  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
year problem 
it is possible that a portion of the company s currently installed computer systems  software products  billing systems  networks  database or other business systems collectively the company s systems  or those of the company s customers working either alone or in conjunction with other software or systems  will not accept input of  store  manipulate and output dates for the years or thereafter without error or interruption commonly known as the year problem  although initial review indicates that the company s primary unix based operating systems are not at significant risk  other systems  particularly in the finance and administration area  may be 
the company is currently in the process of further evaluating the company s systems to determine whether or not modifications will be required to prevent problems related to the year there can be no assurance that the company will identify all year problems in the company s systems or those of its customers  including network transmission providers  in advance of their occurrence or that the company will be able to successfully remedy any problems that are discovered 
in addition  the company is dependent upon third parties for transmission of most of its calls and other communications 
there can be no assurance that these third party providers will identify and remedy any year problems in their transmission facilities 
the expense of the company s efforts to address such problems  in particular the failure of third party providers of transmission facilities  could have a significant adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on key management and personnel 
the company s success is largely dependent on its executive and other key personnel  the loss of one or more of whom could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company believes that its continued success will depend to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of christopher j 
vizas  the company s new chairman and chief executive officer who joined the company in december  and certain other key executives 
mr 
vizas has entered into an employment agreement  which expires on december  the company also believes that to be successful it must hire and retain highly qualified engineering personnel 
in particular  the company relies on certain key employees to design and develop the company s proprietary calling card platform and related software 
competition in the recruitment of highly qualified personnel in the telecommunications services industry is intense 
the inability of the company to locate  hire and retain such personnel would have an adverse effect on the company 
the company does not have key man life insurance 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to retain its key employees or that it will be able to attract qualified personnel in the future 
regulation 
although the company does not have its own telecommunications facilities and utilizes the facilities of ptts and other carriers  it is subject to regulation as a reseller in many jurisdictions 
united states federal regulation 
under current fcc policy  telecommunications carriers reselling the services of other carriers and not owning telecommunications facilities of their own are considered to be non dominant and  as a result  are subject to streamlined regulation 
the company is required to possess an authorization from the fcc for the provision of international services  and must file tariffs at the fcc setting forth the terms and conditions under which it provides both international and domestic services 
these and other regulatory requirements to which the company presently is subject impose a relatively minimal burden on the company at the present time 
there can be no assurance  however  that the current regulatory environment and the present level of fcc regulation will continue  or that the company will continue to be considered non dominant 
non us government regulation 
in most countries where the company operates  equipment cannot be connected to the telephone network without regulatory approval  and therefore installation and operation of the company s calling card platform or other equipment requires such approval 
in most jurisdictions where the company conducts business it relies on its local partner to obtain the requisite authority 
as a result of the reliance on its local partners  the company is entirely dependent upon the cooperation of the telephone utilities with which it has made arrangements for its authority to conduct business  as well as operational and certain of its administrative requirements 
any telephone utility could cease to accommodate the company s requirements at any time 
depending upon the location of the telephone utility  such action could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and prospects 
there can be no assurance that such relationships will continue or that governmental authorities will not seek to regulate the company s rates or other aspects of its calling card services or require the company to obtain a license to conduct its business 
relations with certain major stockholders 
the company has several major stockholders that have in the past been involved to varying degrees with the management of the company 
the company does not believe that any stockholders have meritorious claims arising out of the company s business 
however  there is a risk that one  or more  of such stockholders might take positions adverse to a present  or past  management action  including litigation 
the company has no control over the actions of such stockholders and were actions taken at any given time there could be an adverse effect on the company s ability to execute its business plan 
volatility of common stock price 
the market price of the company s common stock fluctuates over a wide range and may continue to do so in the future 
such fluctuations could be in response to factors and events related to matters other than the performance of the company  including the depth and liquidity of the trading market of the common stock  changes in estimates by analysts  market conditions in the industry  announcements by competitors  regulatory actions and general economic conditions 
dividend policy 
the company has not declared or paid cash dividends on its capital stock and does not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
anti takeover provisions 
the company has adopted a rights plan and has entered into a stockholder rights agreement dated february  between the company and american stock transfer trust company  as rights agent the rights agreement 
the rights agreement provides for the issuance of rights the rights for each share of common stock outstanding on february   each right representing the right to purchase one one hundredth of a share of the company s series a participating preferred stock the series a preferred stock at a price of per one hundredth of a share of series a preferred stock  subject to adjustment 
all shares of common stock issued by the company between the date of adoption of the rights agreement and the distribution date as defined in the rights agreement or  the date  if any  on which the rights are redeemed will have rights attached to them 
the rights become exercisable upon the occurrence of certain defined change of control triggering events 
the rights will have certain anti takeover effects as they will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that acquires a substantial interest in the company without the prior approval of the board of directors of the company 
the effect of the rights may be to inhibit a change in control of the company including through a third party tender offer at a price which reflects a premium to then prevailing trading prices that may be beneficial to the company s stockholders 
the company s restated certificate of incorporation allows the board of directors to issue up to five million shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights  privileges and preferences of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of the common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any shares of preferred stock that may be issued by the company in the future 
any issuances of preferred stock in the future could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of the outstanding voting stock of the company 
in addition  the company is subject to certain anti takeover provisions of the delaware general business corporation law  which could have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change of control of the company

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company is a global value added service provider of telecommunications and information services  focused on mobile end users  messaging and information management 
at the present time  the company s core business is the provisioning of global calling card services  and related validation  billing and payment services 
operating through its world directt network  the company originates voice traffic in countries and territories and terminates such traffic anywhere in the world 
the company s global services are delivered through proprietary routing  application and data access software  which run on the company s interactive call processing platform calling card platforms 
forty calling card platforms are installed in strategic locations around the world where they connect directly with national and international telephone networks 
in addition to routing calls  the company s calling card platform validates calls  controls fraud  captures usage information and issues bills with full call details 
the calling card platform system provides a user interface in multiple languages for operator assisted calls and the company s proprietary billing software provides for multiple currency billing 
revenue 
the large majority of the company s revenue results from providing services and is generated through contracts for calling card enhancement and platform services 
other services revenue sources include the sale of international toll free services and revenue generated by use of the company s proprietary calling cards 
the company generally charges its customers  principally ptt s  postal  telegraph and telephone authorities other telecommunications providers and issuers of credit cards  for calling card enhancement and platform services on a per call basis  where the charge per call is determined by minutes of customer usage and the originating and terminating points of the call 
in the case of calling card enhancement services  where the company arranges for the transmission of the call as well as the various processing functions  a significant portion of the revenues relates to the costs of the transmission which the company obtains from third party providers 
for platform services the customer arranges for its own transmission 
as a result  calling card enhancement services have much higher revenue from customers than do platform services per minute of usage 
in certain years the company has generated revenue from other sources  classified as non service  which generally have consisted of sales of billing and platform systems and nonrecurring special projects 
costs 
the principal component of the company s cost of revenue for calling card enhancement services is transmission costs 
the company continues to pursue strategies for reducing its cost of transmission 
these strategies include establishing partnering arrangements with various carriers  negotiating more cost effective agreements with other carriers and routing traffic to the least cost  highest quality providers 
in addition  the company has entered into an outsourcing agreement with a company that is reviewing all of the company s domestic service providers bills to ensure that bills are in compliance with current contracts and domestic telecommunications regulations 
other components of the company s operating costs are selling  general and administrative expenses  which include personnel costs  consulting and legal fees  travel expenses  bad debt allowances and other administrative expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense includes the allocation of the cost of transmission equipment  property and office equipment  and various intangible assets over their useful lives 
results of operations year ended march  compared to year ended march  overview 
the company incurred a net loss of million for the year ended march   of which million is attributable to the following charges in millions corporate realignment costs proxy related litigation settlement costs additional income tax provision additional allowance for doubtful accounts warrants associated with debt other items these charges result principally from a detailed review of the company s activities initiated by new management during the third quarter of fiscal and are described in more detail below 
excluding these items  the company incurred a net loss for fiscal of million compared to net income in fiscal of million 
the difference is principally due to a million contribution to net income in fiscal of high margin revenues from non services sources which did not recur in fiscal also in fiscal  the company s gross profit from its services business remained flat compared to fiscal while it incurred additional recurring operating expenses of million  principally depreciation and amortization 
interest expense  excluding a million charge related to the amortization of debt discount associated with warrants related to term loans see note to consolidated financial statements for further information increased by million over fiscal foreign exchange losses increased by million over fiscal new management is taking steps to increase revenues and improve margins 
they have completed a review of the operations and activities of the company and have refocused the company s marketing and sales activities with an emphasis on stabilizing and growing the existing core business and on adding new services 
in practical terms  this means that recently the company has refocused its resources on calling card enhancement and platform services and plans to leverage its global network to offer various enhanced communications services  the company has established a small staff devoted to improving its network structure and reducing its marginal transmission costs and  therefore  its cost of revenue  and contracts have been entered into with several vendors which will help to reduce transmission costs in the next fiscal year  the company has increased its sales and marketing staff and allocated additional funds for marketing and promotional activities  and staffing needs have been assessed and reductions and realignments have been completed 
the company has instituted a process to add new network and operations staff as necessary to support new contracts 
a thorough review of corporate practices and procedures has been completed 
this review resulted in a number of improvements to internal reporting and review procedures 
the company has also undertaken a study to simplify its organizational and tax structure and has identified potential international tax issues 
in connection with this study  the company realized it had a potential tax liability and recorded an additional tax provision of million in the fiscal fourth quarter to reserve against liabilities which might arise under the existing structure 
the company s study is continuing and the eventual outcome cannot be predicted with certainty 
no tax claims have been asserted against the company 
revenue 
the company s revenue sources can be classified into two categories years ended march  in millions services non services 
total as the above table indicates  revenue for the year ended march  was million 
by comparison  revenue for the year ended march  was million  including million attributable to non service revenue principally billing and platform equipment sales  revenue from calling card production and contract settlement charges related to special projects 
although total revenue decreased from fiscal to fiscal  service revenue increased million or 
the increase was due to increased customer usage partially offset by a combination of three elements a decline in revenue from the long distance resale services of the company  lower per minute revenue due to new pricing programs which went into effect in the first and second quarters of fiscal  and a lack of new revenue generating contracts in the current fiscal year 
as anticipated  the company s focused sales efforts did not have an impact on the fiscal year ended march   but management believes that these efforts will have their initial impact in the fourth quarter of calendar year gross profit 
gross profit was or million for the year ended march   compared to or million for the year ended march  this decline was due partially to the positive margin contribution of non service revenues in the year ended march  which did not reoccur in the year ended march  excluding the effects of non service revenue  gross profit for services revenue was for fiscal compared to for fiscal this decrease was due to lower pricing related to various customer contracts which was not offset by corresponding decreases in transmission costs  the principal component of cost of revenue 
the company expects that unit pricing in its core business of calling card enhancement is likely to continue to decline  and is taking steps that it believes will reduce its transmission costs 
cost of revenue may be expected to fluctuate in the next few periods as new pricing and contractual arrangements are put in place and as the company works to improve its network structure and transmission costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended march   compared to million for the year ended march   an increase of million or 
as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses were and for the years ended march  and  respectively 
a major factor in the increase is the addition of million to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
of this amount  half is related to one customer who has  in the company s view  unilaterally taken unsubstantiated credits off invoiced amounts and has refused to pay a large invoice for contract settlement charges related to a special prepaid calling card service 
the company believes the full amount of the amounts invoiced to this customer is legally due and owing but has established an allowance as of march  to reflect potential costs of collection 
the balance of the remaining increase in the allowance is spread among several accounts  principally in the asia pacific area  to provide for collection issues that may arise from economic and other factors 
the company incurred million in other selling  general and administrative expenses related to increases in payroll due to the hiring of new management and other personnel  consulting and legal fees  travel expenses and for internal communication costs 
corporate realignment expense 
the company incurred various realignment costs during fiscal resulting from the review of operations and activities undertaken by new corporate management

the company does not anticipate further realignment costs in the future 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended march  was million compared to million for the year ended march   an increase of million or

interest expense net of interest income for the year ended march  was million  compared to million for the year ended march   an increase of million or 
this increase relates primarily to expenses of million related to additional interest expense associated with warrants to purchase common stock issued in conjunction with debt obligations 
also  in fiscal  there was an increase in average borrowings during the fiscal year and the company incurred additional finance charges relating to the extensions of a term loan 
the company recorded a foreign currency transaction loss of million during fiscal arising from foreign currency cash and accounts receivable balances maintained by the company during the year in which the us dollar strengthened significantly 
the company s exposure to foreign currency losses is mitigated due to the variety of customers and markets which comprise the company s customer base  as well geographic diversification of that customer base 
in addition  most of the company s largest customers settle their accounts in us dollars 
during fiscal  the company incurred proxy related litigation expense of million arising from the class action lawsuit for which a settlement agreement was reached  as described above see item legal proceedings 
of this amount  million relates to the escrow of  shares of the company s common stock  which have been valued at per share pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement 
such value relates to the company s obligation to issue additional stock or cash if the market price of the company s stock is less than per share during the defined periods 
taxes on income 
taxes on income for the year ended march  were million  compared to million for the year ended march   an increase of million 
the increase in the tax provision for amounts currently due is primarily the result of the company s completion of a study to simplify its tax structure wherein  it identified potential international tax issues 
in connection with this study  the company realized it had potential tax liabilities and recorded an additional tax provision of million in the fiscal fourth quarter 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding taxes on income 
year ended march  compared to year ended march  revenue

the number of employees increased to for the year ended march  compared to for the year ended march   a increase

interest expense

cash flows from financing activities in fiscal related primarily to the proceeds from the issuance of notes payable and the assumption of capital lease obligations totaling million decreased by principal payments and retirement of long term debt obligations of million 
subsequent to march   the company expended million in connection with potential acquisitions see item business recent developments above and has committed to expend an additional million in july and august  related to these transactions 
at march   net accounts receivable equaled million compared to million at march  due to the total cash commitments of million on the acquisitions in progress  the company s cash resources are currently limited 
under the direction of its new management  the company has instituted a program to improve this situation  the principal elements of which are executing more aggressive collection efforts of accounts receivable  establishing effective controls over capital expenditures  reducing transmission costs by negotiating new contracts with carriers  and implementing policies and procedures to control overhead costs associated with staffing  travel  communications and other areas 
these steps  coupled with substantial augmentation of the marketing and sales efforts  should permit the company to achieve positive operating cash flow for the existing core business by the end of the fiscal quarter ending december   in the absence of any unexpected developments 
for the existing core business  should the anticipated revenue growth  accounts receivable collection effort and cost control program described above not result in positive cash flow by december   the company intends to institute more significant cost cutting measures 
current funding requirements 
management estimates that  based upon its current expectations for growth  the company will require additional funding of up to million through the end of for the execution of its business plan  the principal requirements being the financing of its acquisition program and capital expenditures for new service offerings 
the funding required by the company may consist of one or more of the following i issuing additional shares of common stock or preferred stock or convertible debt ii obtaining a loan facility secured by accounts receivable  iii establishing a credit facility to finance equipment purchased and other capital additions  or iv additional cash flow generated from operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its efforts to raise such additional capital on favorable terms 
should the company be unsuccessful in its efforts to raise capital it may be required to modify or curtail its plans for growth
