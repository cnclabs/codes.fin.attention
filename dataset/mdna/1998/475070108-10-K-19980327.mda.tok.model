liquidity liquidity requirements are met primarily by positive cash flows from the operations of insurance subsidiaries and other consolidated subsidiaries 
overall sources of liquidity are sufficient to satisfy operating requirements 
primary sources of cash from the insurance segment are premiums  other insurance considerations  receipts for policyholder accounts  investment sales and maturities and investment income 
primary uses of cash include purchase of investments  payment of benefits  operating expenses  withdrawals from policyholder accounts  costs related to acquiring new business and income taxes

cash was used to pay dividends of  and during  and in order to meet the parent company s dividend payments  debt servicing obligations and other expenses  internal dividends are received from the subsidiary companies 
total internal cash dividends paid to the parent company from its subsidiaries during  and were  and jp life has been the primary source of dividends 
of the dividends to jp by its subsidiaries  from jp life was specifically to assist in funding the chubb life acquisition 
the company s life insurance subsidiaries are subject to laws in the states of domicile that limit the amount of dividends that can be paid without the prior approval of the respective state s insurance commissioner 
because of the extraordinary dividends paid by jp life and chubb life to its former parent during the second quarter of  any future dividends by these companies through april will require regulatory approval 
the company obtained regulatory approval for a jp life dividend of which was paid on march  an additional of dividends from jp life are planned for  a portion of which will require regulatory approval 
the company has no reason to believe that such approval will be withheld 
no dividends from chubb life are planned for cash and short term investments were  and at december   and additionally  fixed income and equity securities held by the parent company and non regulated subsidiaries were  and at december   and these securities  less the at december  of nationsbank stock which supports the exchangeable securities  are considered to be sources of liquidity to support the company s strategies 
total trading securities and debt and equity securities available for sale at december  were  investments jp s strategy for managing the insurance investment portfolio is to dependably meet pricing assumptions while achieving the highest possible after tax returns over the long term 
cash flows are invested primarily in fixed income securities 
the nature and quality of the various types of investments held by insurance subsidiaries must comply with state regulatory requirements 
the company has a formal investment policy that governs overall quality and diversification 
jp held the following carrying amounts of investments december  december  publicly issued bonds   privately placed bonds   commercial mortgage loans   common stock policy loans   preferred stock real estate cash and other invested assets total   the strategy of identifying market sectors and niches that provide investment opportunities to meet the portfolios growth  quality and yield requirements is expected to continue to result in increasing percentages of private placements and commercial mortgage loans  which as a percentage of total investments declined in due to the chubb life acquisition 
jp s investment policy statement policy requires an average quality fixed income portfolio excluding mortgage loans of a or higher 
currently  the average quality is a  excluding mortgage loans 
the policy also imposes limits on the amount of lower quality investments and requires diversification by issuer and asset type 
the company monitors higher risk investments for compliance with the policy and for proper valuation 
securities that experience other than temporary declines in value are adjusted to net realizable values through a charge to earnings 
commercial mortgage loans in foreclosure are carried at the net present value of expected future cash flows 
the company has established a reserve to account for impaired mortgage loans which was as of december  and carrying amounts of investments categorized as higher risk assets were december  december  bonds near or in default bonds below investment grade mortgage loans days delinquent or in foreclosure mortgage loans restructured foreclosed properties sub total  higher risk assets all other investments   total cash and investments   the level of below investment grade bonds  which increased slightly during  is within the guidelines authorized by the policy 
generally  non investment grade bonds  whether purchased via private placements or in public markets  are in the highest tier of ratings just below investment grade 
the investment policy permits the use of derivative financial instruments such as futures contracts and interest rate swaps in conjunction with specific direct investments 
the company uses interest rate swaps to protect against interest rate fluctuations  to modify the interest characteristics of certain blocks of annuity contracts  and  on occasion  to protect against yield curve changes between identifying and closing mortgage loan and private placement investments 
the company is exposed to credit risks when entering into swap agreements and limits this risk by entering into agreements with multiple counterparties having high credit ratings 
the company s actual use of derivative financial instruments has been limited  using them to manage well defined interest rate risks 
interest rate swaps with a notional value of  and were open as of december   and termination of these arrangements under then current interest rates would have resulted in a gain of the periodic cash settlements under these arrangements are reflected as an adjustment to investment income 
collateralized mortgage obligations cmo s as of december were available for sale  at fair value federal agency issued cmo s   corporate private labeled cmo s  total   the company s investment strategy with respect to cmo s focuses on actively traded  less volatile issues that produce relatively stable cash flows 
the majority of cmo holdings are sequential tranches of federal agency issuers 
chubb life had cmo s of at december   resulting in the overall increase since year end the cmo portfolio has been constructed with underlying mortgage collateral characteristics and structure in order to lower cash flow volatility over a range of interest rate levels 
due to the high quality and liquid nature of these investments  the company believes that the impairment risks associated with these securities are no greater than those applicable to direct agency or corporate issues 
net investment income grew in to  versus in to in and  net investment income without acquisitions grew and despite lower investment yields on new investments during the three year period 
year conversion costs the company has been analyzing the year computer systems problem since during the course of this analysis  the company has ascertained that failure to alleviate year systems problems could result in a material disruption to the company s operations in the year a centralized oversight and project management process has been put into place to facilitate compliance of all company information systems prior to the end of this oversight process includes communications with significant suppliers to the extent the company s systems are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remedy year issues 
the assessment phase of the year effort including mainframe and alternative systems is complete for the majority of systems and several have been brought into year compliance 
to date  the company has incurred external costs of the remainder of this effort is expected to be completed by the third quarter of utilizing internal and external resources  with remaining external costs estimated at approximately however  there can be no guarantee that these results will be achieved and actual results could differ materially 
all costs associated with this effort are being expensed as incurred 
market risk exposures since jp s assets and liabilities are largely monetary in nature  the company s financial position and earnings are subject to risks resulting from changes in interest rates at varying maturities  changes in spreads over us treasuries on new investment opportunities  changes in the yield curve and equity pricing risks 
continued favorable economic conditions in the united states  contributed to a decline in year us treasury rates of basis points in versus an basis point increase in these forces contributed to an increase in unrealized gains on securities available for sale of in and a decrease of in further  throughout  various forces in the fixed income markets have resulted in a compression of risk premiums over treasury securities that can be earned on new investments 
in a falling interest rate environment  the risk of prepayment on some fixed income securities increases  causing funds to be reinvested at lower yields 
the company limits this risk by concentrating the fixed income portfolio on non callable securities  through careful selection of cmo s that are structured to minimize cash flow volatility and by purchasing securities that provide for make whole type prepayment fees 
falling interest rates can also impact demand for the company s products  as bank certificates of deposit with no surrender charges and higher average returns from equity markets may become more attractive to new and existing customers 
conversely  in a rising interest rate environment  competitive pressures may make it difficult for the company to sustain spreads between rates credited on interest sensitive products and portfolio earnings rates  thereby prompting withdrawals by policyholders 
the company manages this risk by adjusting interest crediting rates  at least on an annual basis  with due regard to the yield of its investment portfolio and pricing assumptions and by prudently managing interest rate risk of assets and liabilities 
as is typical in the industry  the company s life and annuity products contain minimum rate guarantees regarding interest credited 
for interest sensitive life products the minimum rates range from approximately to  with an approximate weighted average of 
for annuity products  the minimum rates range from to  with the greatest concentration in the to range 
the company employs various methodologies to manage its exposure to interest rate risks 
the asset liability management process focuses primarily on the management of interest rate risk of the company s insurance operations 
jp monitors the duration of insurance liabilities compared to the duration of assets backing the insurance lines  giving measurement to the optionality of cash flows 
the company s goal in such analysis is to prudently balance profitability and risk for each insurance product class  and for the company in whole 
at december  and  and of life insurance invested assets at amortized cost were held for interest sensitive portfolios and and were held for traditional portfolios and corporate capital and surplus 
the company also considers the timing of cash flows arising from market risk sensitive instruments other than trading and insurance portfolios under varying interest rate scenarios as well as the related impact on reported earnings under those varying scenarios 
market risk sensitive instruments other than trading include debt and equity securities available for sale and held to maturity  mortgage loans  policy loans  investment commitments  annuities in the accumulation phase and periodic payment annuities  commercial paper borrowings  repurchase agreements  interest rate swaps  debt and exchangeable securities  and mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 
the following table shows the estimated impact that various hypothetical interest rate scenarios would be expected to have on the company s earnings for a calendar year  based on the assumptions contained in the company s model change in interest rate incremental income or loss basis points basis points basis points basis points these estimates were derived by modeling estimated cash flows of the company s market risk sensitive instruments and insurance portfolios 
changes in interest rates illustrated above assume parallel shifts in the yield curve graded pro rata over four quarters 
incremental income or loss is net of taxes at 
estimated cash flows produced in the model assume reinvestments representative of jp s current investment strategy and calls prepayments include scheduled maturities as well as those expected to occur when issuers can benefit financially based on the difference between prepayment penalties and new money rates under each scenario 
assumed lapse rates among insurance portfolios give consideration to relationships expected between credited rates and market interest rates  as well as the level of surrender charges inherent in individual contracts 
the illustrated incremental income or loss also includes the expected impact on amortization of dac and voba 
the model is based on the company s existing business in force as of december  and does not consider new sales of life and annuity products or the potential impact as discussed above of interest rate fluctuations on sales 
the company is exposed to equity price risk on its equity securities other than trading 
jp holds common stock with a fair value of approximately of such value is represented by investments in a single issuer  nationsbank 
additionally  the company has outstanding debt securities exchangeable into shares of nationsbank stock  referred to as exchangeable securities 
had the exchangeable securities been redeemable as of year end  the redemption value would have been see notes and 
if the market value of the s p index  and of nationsbank stock specifically  decreased from their december  values  the fair value of the company s common stock and exchangeable securities would change as follows favorable unfavorable change in fair value nationsbank stock exchangeable securities remaining equity securities total change in fair values certain fixed interest rate market risk sensitive instruments may not give rise to incremental income or loss during the period illustrated but may be subject to changes in fair values

external trends and forward looking information jp operates largely in the us financial services market  which is subject to general economic conditions in the us during and  the us economy showed signs of improvement and growth evidenced by strong bond and stock markets and a stronger us dollar 
however  soft market conditions have continued to have a negative impact on the insurance industry 
in the face of flat premium growth  the us insurance industry has experienced an increasing number of mergers  acquisitions  consolidations and sales of business lines 
these activities have been driven by a need to reduce costs of distribution and by the need to increase economies of scale in the face of growing competition from larger consolidating traditional insurers  from non traditional players such as banks  securities brokers and mutual funds and from hmo s and managed care providers 
consolidation is expected to continue  and there is an increasing possibility of federal legislation in that would allow banks  insurance companies and investment banks to affiliate 
jp has grown at a rate faster than the overall industry because of acquisitions  its strong financial position  superior claims paying ratings  and efforts to increase distribution sources 
medical inflation medical inflation and utilization of medical services affect the profitability of health products offered through the individual and group distribution systems 
in the event that premium rates are not adequately adjusted in anticipation of medical trends  profitability of health insurance products is adversely affected 
environmental liabilities jp is exposed to environmental regulation and litigation as a result of ownership of investment real estate and property and casualty and communications subsidiaries 
actual loss experience has been minimal and exposure to environmental losses is considered by the company to be insignificant 
regulatory and legal environment prescribed or permitted statutory accounting principles sap may vary between states and between companies 
the naic is in the process of codifying sap to promote standardization of methods  which might result in changes in statutory accounting practices for the company 
such changes are not expected to impact the company s statutory capital requirements significantly 
assessments by state guaranty associations are made to cover losses to policyholders of insolvent or rehabilitated insurance companies 
assessments may be partially recovered through a reduction in future premium taxes in most states 
the company has accrued for expected assessments net of estimated future premium tax deductions 
in recent years  the life insurance industry has experienced increased litigation in which large jury awards including punitive damages have occurred
