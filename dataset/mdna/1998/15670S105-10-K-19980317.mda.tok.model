year ended december  dollars in thousands net sales    cost of sales    operating expenses    operating income    year ended december   compared to the year ended december  net sales net sales increased by million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the average selling price per thousand envelopes decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   due primarily to the pass through of material cost reductions to customers  offset somewhat by the higher price product mix effect from acquisitions 
because material cost changes have historically been passed through to customers  the company uses volumes of units sold and material gross margin that is  net sales less cost of materials net of waste recovery revenue as revenue trend indicators in its envelope operations 
unit volume increased to billion units for the year ended december  from billion units for the year ended december   with acquisitions accounting for of this increase 
material gross margin per thousand envelopes sold increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  cost of sales total cost of sales  as a percent of sales  decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  cost of sales includes material net of waste recovery revenue  labor  depreciation and other manufacturing and distribution costs 
material costs net of waste recovery revenue  as a percentage of sales  were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decline is attributable to material cost reductions passed through to customers as discussed above 
other manufacturing costs  as a percent of sales  increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   due primarily to the decreased selling price previously discussed 
on a per thousand envelopes sold basis  other manufacturing and distribution costs  excluding the product mix effect from acquisitions  increased only from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  inflationary cost increases were offset by efficiency improvements and volume increases 
operating expenses operating expenses include selling and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december   operating expenses  as a percent of sales  increased to from compared to the prior year again primarily due to the decrease in selling prices 
excluding the effect of acquisitions during the years  the increase in operating expenses for the year ended december  was compared to the prior year primarily due to increased selling expenses attributable to increased emphasis on sales growth 
year ended december   compared to the year ended december  net sales net sales increased million from net sales recorded for the year ended december  the dollar increase included million of net sales from the acquisition of quality for the nine months ended december   offset by a million decrease on the other us envelope operations 
exclusive of quality s sales dollars and volumes  the average selling price increased by from per thousand units in to per thousand units in the increase was due to a higher value added product mix and managing selling prices relative to paper costs 
total volume for the us envelope operations excluding quality decreased to billion units in from billion units in volume in was negatively impacted by lower direct mail and merchant volume  and a shift towards more complex  higher margin products for which fewer units were sold at higher selling prices 
cost of sales total cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  remained steady at for as compared to in in total dollars  cost of sales includes an additional million as a result of the acquisition of quality for the nine months ended december  the remaining million represents of net sales exclusive of quality as compared to cost of sales of in the prior year 
again  because material costs have historically been passed through to customers  the company uses material gross margin net sales less cost of materials net of waste recovery revenue and volume of units sold as its revenue trend indicators in envelope operations 
when measured on a unit basis  material gross margin exclusive of quality s operations increased from per thousand units in the year ended december  to per thousand units for the year ended december  material gross margin including quality s operations was per thousand units in the year ended december  the increase in material gross margin on a unit basis was attributable to the company s ability to manage selling price relative to declining paper prices 
the favorable effect of lower paper costs on gross margin was largely offset by decreased proceeds from the sale of waste paper and increases in other costs as a percentage of sales 
material costs  exclusive of waste revenue  were and of net sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
waste recovery revenue declined from per thousand units in to per thousand units in which resulted in a decline in waste recovery revenue to million from million in operating expenses operating expenses include selling and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december   operating expenses  as a percentage of sales  increased to from in of the total million increase  million relates to additional operating expenses as a result of the acquisition of quality 
the increase from was due to higher compensation and benefit costs in the administrative area  which were offset  in part  by the reduction or elimination of redundant functions in acquired businesses 
canadian envelope the following table presents historical financial data for the canadian envelope segment including acquisitions supremex  png from their purchase dates 
year ended december  dollars in thousands net sales    cost of sales    operating expenses    operating income    year ended december   compared to the year ended december  net sales net sales for the year ended december  were up over the year ended december   due to the png acquisition in november the supremex sales without png for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  were down  due primarily to an average canadian dollar exchange rate decrease of 
unit sales were higher for the year ended december  versus also due to the png acquisition 
excluding png  unit sales were higher for the year ended december  versus the overall average selling price per unit was down in the year ended december  from the year ended december   due to the average exchange rate decrease and reductions in average material cost passed through to the customer 
cost of sales total cost of sales  as a percent of sales  decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  cost of sales includes material net of waste recovery revenue  labor  depreciation and other manufacturing and distribution costs 
material costs net of waste recovery revenue  as a percentage of sales  were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decline is attributable to material cost reductions passed through to customers as reductions in selling price 
other manufacturing costs  as a percent of sales  also decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  on a per thousand envelopes sold basis manufacturing costs decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the manufacturing decrease is attributable to cost reductions relating to the consolidation of png operations partially offset by higher wage rates 
operating expenses operating expenses include selling and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december   operating expenses  as a percent of sales  decreased to from in the year ended december  operating expenses decreased  as a percent of sales  due to the assimilation of png operations with consolidation of selling and administrative functions 
year ended december   compared to the year ended december  net sales net sales for the year ended increased as compared to sales for the year ended the increase was due to the fact that the figures include the operations of supremex for the entire year as compared to the figures which include results for only five months 
png net sales for the month ended december   were nominal 
the average selling price increased by and was due to a higher margin  customized product mix 
total volume increased to billion units from billion units in the volume increase was due to the timing of the acquisition of supremex 
cost of sales cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  decreased to for the year ended december  as compared to for the five months ended december  the million increase reflects the fact that the figures include the operations of supremex for the entire year as compared to the figures which include results for only five months 
the decline in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales is largely due to the company s ability to effectively manage fluctuations in the cost of paper and related fluctuations in sales prices 
again  because material costs have historically been passed through to customers  the company uses material gross margin net sales less cost of materials net of waste recovery revenue and volume of units sold as its revenue trend indicators in envelope operations 
when measured on a unit basis  material gross margin per thousand units increased from per unit in to per unit in a favorable effect on gross margins also occurred due to lower paper costs  which decreased from the average 
operating expenses operating expenses include selling and administrative expenses which increased  primarily  due to additional operating expenses as a result of the acquisition of supremex in july high impact color printing the following table presents financial information with respect to the high impact color printing segment including acquisitions gac  sp  allied  color graphics from their purchase dates 
year ended december  dollars in thousands net sales    cost of sales    operating expenses    operating income   year ended december   compared to the year ended december  net sales net sales for the high impact color printing segment for the year ended december  increased million compared to the year ended december  net sales for gac for the year ended december  declined to million 
the reasons for this sales decline include the decision to pursue more profitable products and eliminate certain unprofitable work  high turnover in sales staff during resulting in the temporary loss of business from some significant accounts and a continuing trend in computer related companies to utilize electronic medium as opposed to printed manuals 
acquisitions completed during the year allied and color graphics contributed million to net sales during the year ended december  in addition sp  purchased in december  had net sales of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the period owned during average paper costs for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  declined resulting in approximately a decline in sales prices as the lower cost was passed through to customers 
cost of sales cost of sales expressed as a percent of net sales decreased to in the year ended december   from in the prior year 
paper costs expressed as a percent of sales declined to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  average paper costs expressed as a percent of sales declined due to changes in product mix resulting from the acquisitions which are primarily sheet fed operations in addition to negotiated reductions in paper costs 
operating expenses expressed as a percent of sales  operating expenses increased to for the year ended december  compared to for the prior year 
the million increase in the year ended december  compared to the prior year is due to acquisitions during the years as operating expense for gac declined million as compared to the prior year 
year ended december   compared to the year ended december  net sales net sales increased million from million in the four months ended december  to million for the year ended december  the majority of the increase is due to the fact that the figures include an entire year of gac operations and the figures include only four months of operations 
also included in net sales for the year ended are sales of million related to sp 
year to year  net sales at gac decreased in from taking into account pre acquisition sales  due to a competitive pricing environment 
in response to this decline in sales price  gac has targeted higher margin markets and is aggressively allocating sales resources to these markets 
another factor affecting the decline in sales dollars was the decrease in paper costs 
fluctuations in paper prices are generally passed on to customers as an integral part of the price of the product 
as paper prices decreased in  as compared to  the sales prices also decreased 
cost of sales the cost of sales decreased to of sales for the year ended december  as compared to for the four months ended december  indicating operating efficiencies realized 
gross margins decreased as a percentage of sales to in from in taking into account pre acquisition operations as a result of the competition in major markets 
reductions in cost of sales were not large enough to offset the decline in sales 
gac has lowered gross margins to meet the competition and  as stated previously  it is concentrating its sales efforts on higher margin product markets 
operating expenses operating expenses include selling and administrative expenses which increased  primarily  due to additional operating expenses as a result of the acquisition of gac in august as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses declined which demonstrates gac s ability to reduce these expenses in a competitive pricing environment

accordingly the related deferred financing costs were written off and accounted for as an extraordinary item in the fourth quarter of the amortization of deferred financing costs increased in the year ended december  compared to due to a full year amortization in of the deferred financing cost capitalized pursuant to the acquisitions
