the sales increase was primarily attributable to three factors 
the first factor is the inclusion of a full year s sales of the speaker and related product lines for recoton audio corporation rac  f k a international jensen incorporated  acquired in late august the second factor is growth in the std and interact video game and multi media product lines 
the third factor is the acquisitions of heco audio produkte gmbh  acquired in december  tambalan limited  acquired in february  and aamp of america  inc  acquired in november these increases were partially offset by slight declines in sales of certain other accessory product lines 
gross profit increased million to million and increased as a percentage of net sales to from in the dollar increase resulted from increased sales  of which rac  interact and std were the primary contributors 
the increase in gross margin percentage is attributable primarily to a higher margin product mix 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in by million to million  and increased as a percentage of net sales from to in the primary portion of the dollar increase was attributable to the inclusion of a full year of the rac operations  acquired in late august  and the other acquisitions 
the percentage increase was attributable to several factors  including increases in the provision for doubtful accounts as a result of the bankruptcy of three customers and increases in market development expenses 
interest expense increased by million to million in this was primarily attributable to the increased debt associated with the rac acquisition  which was carried for a full year in as compared to four months in in addition  the company has incurred debt to finance the growth in sales of the video and computer product lines 
interest expense is expected to increase in as additional funds are obtained to support anticipated growth 
the company s income taxes and effective consolidated income tax rate have been affected by changes in the proportion of domestic and foreign earnings and losses 
while earnings from north america and western europe are primarily taxed at or above united states income tax rates  earnings from the company s asian operations are taxed at a maximum rate of 
the actual tax rate from asian operations is dependent on the proportion of earnings from mainland china 
the company s pretax income of million is comprised of a combination of foreign earnings and domestic losses 
this resulted in a net income tax credit of million  primarily because the tax credits attributable to domestic tax losses were at higher tax rates than the income tax expense attributable to earnings at foreign subsidiaries 
also in the company recorded the benefit of a million tax credit in germany relating to the company s decision to declare dividends from that subsidiary to its us parent 
this compares to pretax income of million and corresponding income tax expense of million 
management estimates that this trend will not continue in because of projected changes in the proportion of domestic and foreign taxable earnings and because of the expiration of a portion of a tax holiday applicable to certain earnings from mainland china
