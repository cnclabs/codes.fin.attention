the following table compares net sales by business group for the two years increase percent decrease change in thousands casegoods    upholstery    contract sales    divested companies   n m taking into account that fiscal had one more week of shipments than the prior year  the company s residential casegoods sales trends in were slightly below those estimated for the industry  and the upholstery sales trends were below industry estimates 
these sales trends were due primarily to the company s decision during to significantly reduce shipments to a major furniture retailer because profit margins were not considered to be acceptable  and the decision during the third quarter of to reduce shipments to another major furniture retailer due to its weakening credit position 
the upholstery group s sales decrease was also impacted by continued efforts to focus on profitable product lines and to realign its sales and manufacturing departments 
the sales growth in the contract sales group continued to exceed sales trends estimated for the hospitality sector  where hotels motels continue to refurbish rooms at an accelerated pace  and in the assisted living and government sectors 
the company anticipates that the trend in contract sales growth will moderate in  but continue in the single to lower double digit range 
the company believes that production capacity available at its casegoods group manufacturing facilities  as well as from a recently announced expansion of the contract group s upholstery operations  will be sufficient to accommodate this anticipated sales growth in the company s backlog increased over million during the current year  principally due to strong late third quarter and fourth quarter orders received in each of the three business groups

in the aggregate  these two actions resulted in a one time million decrease in cost of sales in excluding the divestiture companies and the above mentioned nonrecurring transactions  pro forma cost of sales was of net sales in  compared to the reported in the pro forma gross margin of increased to in primarily due to the following factors i successful product introductions at the october and april furniture markets were shipped in  ii the ongoing savings that resulted from the termination of the above mentioned retiree and employee benefits  and iii increased absorption of plant overhead due to increased sales and production 
the company believes that increases in sales  further cost savings actions  and new product introductions will continue to increase gross margins in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were of net sales in  compared to of net sales in on a pro forma basis  excluding the divestiture companies  sg a expenses were in and in the decrease in sg a expenses as a percent of net sales is due principally to a reduction in bad debt expense

the company s total aggregate bad debt write off for these two companies was less than  as a result of a planned reduction in credit exposure 
the company anticipates that its sg a expense will be in the range of to of net sales during other deductions decreased in the aggregate to of net sales from in the prior year 
the principal reason for the decline was that interest expense  as a percent of net sales  was in  down from in  due mainly to a decrease of million in average outstanding borrowings during the fiscal year 
the interest rate margin over libor and prime on the company s bank borrowings can be reduced upon the company meeting specified financial ratios related to operating cash flow and debt levels 
based on the company s financial performance  the interest rate margin was reduced by effective april  additionally  effective october   the company received from its bank group an interest rate margin reduction of in both its prime and libor rate matrices 
these decreases in the company s interest rate margin were somewhat offset by increases in the prime and libor base rates in the first quarter of the principal reason for the decrease in the company s effective tax rate to in fiscal from a tax benefit of in the previous year was due to a reduction in various tax credits realized in the company s combined effective federal and state tax rate for is expected to approximate

the restructuring charge resulted from the company s decision to divest four operating companies brown jordan  fournier furniture  daystrom furniture and lea lumber plywood  close four company owned retail stores  and reorganize the remaining companies to improve operating performance

the costs charged against aggregate restructuring reserves of million at december  totaled million in and million in management believes the actions represented by these charges have repositioned the company to achieve improved operating performance within the furniture manufacturing industry 
fiscal compared to consolidated net sales for fiscal decreased million  or  to million from million in on a pro forma basis  excluding the four divestiture companies  as well as the company owned retail stores closed in  fiscal consolidated net sales would have decreased by 
the following table illustrates the comparison of net sales by business group for the year increase percent decrease change in thousands casegoods    upholstery   contract sales    divested companies    the company s residential casegoods and upholstery sales trends in were below those estimated for the industry largely due to the company s decision to discontinue selling to certain accounts with unsatisfactory margins

as more fully discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  these two actions in the aggregate resulted in a million decrease in cost of sales in excluding the divestiture companies and the company owned retail stores  the above mentioned nonrecurring transactions  and non cash charges totalling million recorded in  cost of sales was of net sales in both and negatively impacting margins in and were production decreases of and  respectively  to reduce inventory levels of the casegoods group  resulting in increased amounts of unabsorbed fixed overhead costs 
sg a expenses were of net sales in  compared to of net sales in fiscal on a pro forma basis  excluding the divestiture companies and the company owned retail stores  sg a expenses were of net sales in  compared to of net sales in this decrease in was primarily attributable to the second quarter non cash charge totalling million to increase the company s bad debt reserves and provide for other miscellaneous expenses  as well as to costs in associated with the company s accounts receivable securitization program  which was in place for all of and was terminated at the end of s first quarter

other deductions in were positively impacted by an million insurance settlement 
other deductions in and included non cash charges totalling million and million  respectively  attributable to the write off of unamortized financing costs and other noncurrent assets  and the recognition of other liabilities 
the principal reason for the increase in the company s effective tax rate to in fiscal from in the previous year was the realization of tax benefits from the utilization of tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources in july  the company refinanced its long term and short term bank credit facility with a new credit facility the facility which consisted of a million three year revolving credit line and a million term loan 
on january   the facility was amended to reduce the revolving credit loan to million 
the facility is secured by substantially all the assets of the company  including equipment  inventory  receivables and real property 
borrowings under the facility bear interest at rates selected periodically by the company of libor plus  or prime plus  for the revolving credit loan  and libor plus  or prime plus  for the term loan 
the interest rate margin over libor and prime can be reduced upon the company meeting a financial ratio related to operating cash flow and debt levels 
based on the company s financial performance  the interest rate margin was reduced by effective april  additionally  effective october   the company received from its bank group an interest rate margin reduction of in both its prime and libor rate matrices 
these decreases in the company s interest rate margin were somewhat offset by increases in the prime and libor base rates in the first quarter of the term loan portion of the facility is payable in quarterly installments of million 
the facility restricts the amount of the company s capital spending  lease obligations  borrowings  and the payment of dividends 
in connection with the refinancing  unamortized financing costs of  were charged to operations in due to the refinancing  the company incurred fees and expenses in aggregating approximately million which will be amortized over the terms of the facility 
at january   there was million available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility 
on january   net working capital totaled million and the current ratio was both of these financial measures were improvements over the prior year  which was primarily attributable to planned increases in trade accounts receivable and inventories to support the improved order rate for the last four months of during  the company generated net cash from operating activities of million  a decrease of million compared to the prior year 
during  capital spending totaled million  down from the prior year s million 
an increase in working capital associated with the growth in sales used cash of million in capital expenditures during and were funded from the company s operations and from borrowings under the company s existing long term credit facility 
total debt as a percentage of total debt plus shareholders equity total debt ratio was at the end of  compared to at the end of the decrease in the total debt ratio was due to the company increasing its equity through current year earnings and the company repaying debt from operating cash flow and from the sale leaseback of a manufacturing facility 
the company anticipates spending less than million for capital improvements during  and believes that the unused revolving credit line available under the facility and cash generated from operations will be adequate to fund these planned investments  as well as its lease commitments 
the company anticipates that its cash flow from operations will exceed its capital expenditures in  enabling the company to further reduce its outstanding borrowings and accordingly  its total debt ratio 
the company will continue to review and invest in its software systems and applications to ensure the company is year compliant 
the financial impact on the company is not anticipated to be material to its financial position or results of operations in any given year 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  reporting comprehensive income 
this statement establishes standards for reporting comprehensive income and its components in consolidated financial statements 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company plans to adopt the provisions of sfas in the fiscal year and does not expect that the adoption of this statement will impact the company s financial position and results of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board also established new accounting standards for disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas that requires publicly owned companies to report certain financial information about operating segments  as well as certain information about those operating segment s products and services  the geographic areas in which they operate  and their major customers

impact of inflation although the effects of inflation on the company cannot be accurately determined  in the impact of inflation marginally affected the company s manufacturing costs in the areas of manufacturing overhead and raw materials other than lumber 
the price of lumber  like the prices of other commodities  is affected more by the interaction of supply and demand than by inflation 
although margins were impacted by inflation  the company s gross profit margins during the past several years have  in general  been impacted more by promotional selling discounts and plant downtime taken to curtail production than by inflation 
the company believes it will be able to largely offset the effects of inflation by improving its manufacturing efficiency  increasing employee productivity  substituting raw materials  and increasing the selling prices of its products
