introduction since its inception in  endosonics has been engaged primarily in the research and development of products for the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease 
since  a majority of the company s net revenue has been derived from sales of its ivus imaging systems and catheters 
the company markets and distributes its ivus imaging products in the united states  europe and japan through relationships with strategic partners  certain other distributors and  to a lesser extent  through a direct sales force 
in february  endosonics and cordis entered into the exclusive distribution agreement pursuant to which cordis was granted the exclusive right to distribute endosonics ivus imaging products for coronary applications in north america  europe  africa and the middle east 
cordis is obligated during each year of the exclusive distribution agreement to use reasonable efforts to purchase certain minimum annual amounts of products from endosonics 
subject to certain exceptions  cordis failure to meet the minimum annual purchase amount during any year of the exclusive distribution agreement shall constitute a material breach of such agreement 
cordis is also obligated during the term of the exclusive distribution agreement to undertake certain efforts to market  promote  distribute and sell endosonics ivus imaging products  including the provision of adequate personnel and facilities  the maintenance of sufficient inventory for demonstration purposes and the appointment of a united states and european intracoronary ultrasound marketing manager to interface with endosonics united states and european clinical and support staff 
the exclusive distribution agreement also contains standard representations and warranties of each party and standard provisions regarding indemnification  service and maintenance and confidentiality 
under the terms of the exclusive distribution agreement  cordis shall purchase ivus imaging products from endosonics at agreed upon prices set forth in such agreement  which prices shall be jointly reviewed by endosonics and cordis every six months 
the exclusive distribution agreement initially expires on december   but may be extended by the parties for successive one year periods 
the company currently believes that cordis is unlikely to meet the minimum purchase amounts required under the exclusive distribution agreement for fiscal and has engaged cordis in discussions that would lead to amendment or termination of the exclusive distribution agreement  although neither option can be assured 
the failure of cordis to meet minimum contractual purchase requirements in would have a material adverse effect on the company s operation results 
the failure of cordis to meet minimum contractual purchase requirements in would have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
in connection with the execution of the exclusive distribution agreement  the company issued  shares of its common stock to cordis in a private placement transaction for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  the company has since registered the shares of common stock issued to cordis 
in  the company entered into similar agreements with affiliates of cordis covering japan and certain south american countries 
cardiovascular dynamics  inc  cvd formerly an owned subsidiary of the company  designs  develops  manufactures and markets catheters used to treat certain vascular diseases 
cvd s catheters are used in conjunction with angioplasty and other interventional procedures such as vascular stenting and drug delivery 
cvd completed its initial public offering in june of and  as a result  its assets  liabilities and results of operations are no longer included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company held approximately of the outstanding shares of the common stock of cvd and accounted for its investment on the equity method 
the company s business strategy includes acquiring related businesses  products or technologies 
in january  the company entered into an agreement to acquire cardiometrics  inc cardiometrics through the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of the company with and into cardiometrics  with cardiometrics surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
cardiometrics develops  manufactures  and markets intravascular medical devices to measure blood flow impairment caused by coronary artery disease 
cardiometrics primary products  the flowire r doppler guide wire and flomap ultrasound intsrument  represent an advance in functional testing of blood flow impairment  enabling cardiologists to evaluate the appropriateness of angioplasty interventions and assess post procedural results directly in the cardiac catherization laboratory 
clinical experience demonstrates that the measurement of blood flow impairment downstream from distal to an obstruction  which cardiometrics calls functional angiometry  provides information to improve the quality of patient care and procedure outcomes in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease 
the flowire r flomap system has received clearance from the fda and many corresponding european and pacific rim regulatory agencies 
cardiometrics has also developed the wavewire tm wavemap intracoronary blood pressure measurement system  which was first used in a clinical case in europe in december cardiometrics received a k approval in august and expects the product will be available for sale as early as the first quarter of the acquisition of cardiometrics  which was finalized on july   was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the company incurred a million dollar in process research and development charge as a result of the acquisition and million in restructuring  integration and other non merger charges in connection with plans to reduce overhead of the combined companies 
the company expects that it may pursue additional acquisitions in the future 
any future acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the write off of in process research and development  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to intangible assets acquired  any of which could materially adversely affect the company s business financial condition and results of operations 
in particular  if the company is unable to use the pooling of interests method of accounting  the company will be required to amortize any intangible assets acquired in connection with any additional acquisitions and the amortization periods for such costs will be over the useful lives of such assets  which range from three years to eight years 
additionally  unanticipated expenses may be incurred relating to the integration of technologies and research and development  and administrative functions 
any acquisition will involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired company s employees  operations and products  uncertainties associated with operating in new markets and working with new customers  the potential loss of the acquired company s key employees as well as the costs associated with completing the acquisition and integrating the acquired company 
in  the company introduced both its oracle imaging system  a platform upgrade from its previous system  and enhanced imaging catheters 
the company also commenced the pinnacle development project  which involved the development of new ivus technology and resulted in the five catheter line and an enhanced oracle imaging system 
the company began commercial sales of the enhanced oracle imaging system in the fourth quarter of and began commercial sales of the five catheter line in the first quarter of see business manufacturing 
the company s financial results will be affected in the future by certain factors  including the scaling up of manufacturing for the company s five catheter line  market acceptance of the company s new products and the revenue mix between sales of imaging systems and catheters and changes in government regulation regarding third party reimbursement applicable to the company s system and products 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
results of operations comparison of the year ended december  with the year ended december cardiovascular dynamics results of operations were consolidated in the company s results through june   and accounted for on the equity method thereafter 
cardiometrics results of operations were consolidated in the company s results of operations beginning july  see notes and to consolidated financial statements 
revenue endosonics   cardiovascular dynamics  cardiometrics  total   total revenue 
total revenue in increased by to approximately million from million in the increase is a result of the cardiometrics acquisition  which resulted in an additional million in revenue 
in addition  ivus revenue increased million  primarily in europe and japan 
sales of the company s digital all electronic ivus imaging system and catheters accounted for approximately of total revenue and a increase over results 
the increase is due both to the growth of the overall market for ivus imaging products and increased sales under the company s distribution agreements with cordis and fukuda 
total revenue from cardiometrics was approximately million for the period from the acquisition  july  through december  total cardiovascular dynamics revenue was approximately million in there was no cvd revenue included in currently  a majority of the company s sales of ivus products consists of sales of ivus imaging systems 
the sales of ivus imaging catheters as a percentage of total ivus sales has increased from in to in due to the increase in the company s installed base 
in  export sales as a percentage of total revenue decreased to as compared to in  as domestic sales increased at a greater rate than export sales 
the company currently anticipates that export sales will continue to represent a substantial portion of the company s total revenue in future periods 
cost of product sales 
cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales decreased to approximately from approximately in cost of sales as a percentage of product sales in was reduced principally by volume increases and improved manufacturing efficiencies  as well as favorable margins on cardiometrics products 
gross profit margins on product sales improved to in as compared to in due to the uncertainty associated with continued improvements in efficiency of the company s manufacturing process and the impact of increasingly competitive pricing  there can be no assurance that the company s gross profit margin will be maintained or continue to improve in future periods 
acquired in process research and development write off 
in connection with the company s acquisition of cardiometrics  the company engaged an independent appraiser to provide the company with a recommendation of value for certain assets acquired 
based on this valuation analysis  million of the purchase price has been assigned to in process research and development 
because the technological feasibility of the acquired in process research and development has not been established and has no alternative uses  it was expensed in the third quarter of although the company is in the process of evaluating its research and development projects  it is expected that future expenditures of over million will be necessary to develop the acquired technology into commercial products 
other research  development and clinical 
other research  development and clinical expenses increased to million in from approximately million in cardiometrics portion of research  development and clinical expense for was approximately million 
marketing and sales

general and administrative expenses increased by to approximately million in from approximately million in after adjusting for integration charges of million in and million in  general and administrative expenses increased million 
the increase is attributable to an overall increase in the company s level of operations  however  general and administrative expenses decreased to of total revenue in as compared to of total revenue in restructuring 
concurrent with the purchase of cardiometrics  the company recorded restructuring charges of million related to corporate reorganization costs and plans to reduce overhead of the combined companies 
the charges primarily consist of cash expenditures anticipated in related to termination of certain agreements and relocation and consolidation of facilities 
the company believes that its existing cash resources will be sufficient to fund these expenditures 
other income  net 
other income increased to approximately million in from approximately million in the increase is due to the result of gains realized on the shares of cvd common stock used to acquire cardiometrics  distributions to the company s shareholders and option holders  and the sale of cvd stock  offset in part by a reduction in interest income of million due to reduced cash balances 
net loss 
net loss was million  or per share for  as compared to a net loss of approximately million  or per share in comparison of the year ended december  with the year ended december total revenue 
total revenue in increased by to approximately million from approximately million in this increase was principally the result of an increase in ivus sales in the united states and europe 
sales of the company s digital all electronic ivus imaging system and catheters accounted for approximately of the total revenue 
sales of the oracle imaging system and catheters were approximately million in as compared to approximately million in  an increase of 
the increase is due both to the growth of the overall market for ivus imaging products and increased sales under the company s distribution agreements with cordis and  to a lesser extent  with fukuda 
total revenue from cvd was approximately million for the period from january   to the date of the cvd initial public offering see notes and to the consolidated financial statements  as compared to approximately million for all of currently  a majority of the company s sales of ivus products consists of sales of the company s ivus imaging systems 
the company currently anticipates that sales of ivus imaging catheters will increase as a percentage of total sales of ivus products in future periods as the company s installed base grows

gross profit margins on product sales improved to in as compared to in acquired in process research  development and clinical 
the company recorded no acquired in process research  development and clinical expenses in compared to  in in june  endosonics recorded a non cash charge of  reflecting the final payment in connection with the acquisition of cvd 
other research  development and clinical 
other research  development and clinical expenses decreased by to approximately million in from approximately million in due to a decrease in expenses related to the pinnacle development project and reimbursement from cordis corporation for joint research and development projects  offset by continued investment in cvdis infrastructure to launch and produce its new products until its initial public offering in june of as a percentage of total revenue  these expenses decreased to for from in these expenses decreased by from million to million for the ivus business 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses increased by to approximately million in as compared to approximately million in  primarily due to higher costs associated with increased staffing and marketing programs in europe and the united states to support higher sales levels 
as a percentage of total revenue  marketing and sales expenses decreased to in as compared to in due to increased revenues 
marketing and sales expenses for the ivus business increased from million in to million in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by to approximately million in from approximately million in this increase is attributable to an overall increase in the company s level of operations  however  general and administrative expenses decreased to of total revenue in from of total revenue in these expenses for the ivus business were million for compared with million in  a increase 
other income  net 
other income increased to approximately million in from approximately

net loss decreased to approximately million  or per share  in as compared to a net loss of approximately million  or per share  in for the ivus business  net loss decreased from million to  per share versus per share 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million and no borrowings or credit facilities 
net cash used in operations was million in  as compared to million in working capital decreased to million in  as compared to million in the decrease is primarily due to the use of cash in the acquisition of cardiometrics and the increase in accrued restructuring  integration and other charges 
net cash used in investing activities was million  as compared to million in on july   the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of cardiometrics  inc as a result  cardiometrics assets  liabilities and results of operations since the acquisition date are included in the company s consolidated statements of cash flows

net cash provided by financing activities was million as compared to million in in  the company received million from the issuance of common stock  primarily related to the exercise of common stock options 
in proceeds from the issuance of common stock was million  which includes million issued to a customer 
the company anticipates using cash resources primarily for capital expenditures  product development  sales and marketing efforts and working capital purposes prior to achieving positive cash flow from operations 
the company believes that its existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  will be sufficient to meet the company s operating expenses and capital requirements through however  there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to seek other financing or that such financing  if required  will be available on terms satisfactory to the company 
see future operating results history of operating losses  anticipated future losses 
subsequent events during february  the company  in separate transactions  sold a total of  shares of cvd common stock valued at million  resulting in a gain of million 
also in february  the company s board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program whereby the company may repurchase up to million of its common stock 
impact of year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions to operations  including a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has completed an assessment and will have to modify or replace certain portions of its software in order for its computer systems to function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
because the company s computer programs are primarily packaged software for which there is a year compliant update available  and the company believes that it can make the necessary modifications primarily using the company s personnel  the cost of the year project is not expected to be material 
it is anticipated that the year project will be completed not later than december   which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
the company believes that with modifications to the existing software  the year issue will not pose a significant operational problem 
however  if such modifications are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which assume certain future events  including the continued availability of certain resources 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the effectiveness of the updates received from the company s software vendors at addressing the year issue and similar uncertainties 
tax matters as of december   the company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the company also had federal research and development and other tax credit carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes  of approximately million and million respectively 
the net operating loss and credit carryforwards began expiring and will continue to expire at various dates beginning in through if not utilized 
utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change of ownership rules provided by the internal revenue code and similar state tax provisions 
as a result of the annual limitation  a portion of these carryforwards may expire before ultimately becoming available to reduce future income tax liabilities 
risk factors history of operating losses  anticipated future losses 
the company was founded in and has experienced annual operating losses since its inception 
the company s accumulated deficit at december  was approximately million 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain profitability in the future 
although the company believes that its existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet its liquidity requirements through  there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional financing or that such financing  if required  will be available on satisfactory terms  if at all 
acquisitions 
on july  the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of cardiometrics  inc for approximately million in common stock of the company  common stock of cvd  and cash 
the results of cardiometrics operations have been combined with those of the company since the date of acquisition 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
purchased in process research and development in the amount of million was valued by an independent appraiser 
as it had not reached technological feasibility  and had no probable alternative future uses  it was charged to operations upon acquisition 
goodwill and other intangible assets are being amortized over three to eight years 
in addition  the company recognized a gain of million related to the excess of the fair value over the book value of cvd common stock used as part of the purchase price consideration 
the results of operations for the twelve months ended december  include one time charges of million related to the write off of acquired in process research and development  and million related to restructuring and integration of the two companies 
the company expects that it may pursue additional acquisitions in the future 
any future acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the write off of in process research and development  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to intangible assets acquired  any of which could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in particular  if the company is unable to use the pooling of interests method of accounting  the company will be required to amortize any intangible assets acquired in connection with any additional acquisitions and the amortization periods for such costs will be over the useful lives of such assets  which range from two years to eight years 
additionally  unanticipated expenses may be incurred relating to the integration of technologies and research and development and administrative functions 
any acquisition will involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired company s employees  operations and products  uncertainties associated with operating in new markets and working with new customers  the potential loss of the acquired company s key employees as well as the costs associated with completing the acquisition and integrating the acquired company 
uncertainty of market acceptance 
although external ultrasound imaging and balloon angioplasty are widely used technologies  the use of ivus imaging in connection with interventional cardiology is relatively new 
the commercial success of the company s products will depend upon their acceptance by the medical community as a useful  cost effective component of interventional cardiovascular and peripheral vascular procedures 
ivus imaging is used in conjunction with angioplasty and other intravascular procedures such as vascular stenting 
accordingly  the medical community must determine that the information obtained from the use of the company s ultrasound products will increase the safety or effectiveness or lower the overall cost of the care being provided and that the value of such information justifies the incremental expense of obtaining ivus imaging 
in addition  market acceptance of the company s combination balloon angioplasty ivus imaging catheters will depend  among other things  on a determination by the medical community that the efficacy of the therapeutic component of the company s combination catheters is at least comparable to that of competing non imaging angioplasty catheters and other types of therapy 
although ivus imaging devices have been available for over ten years  the market for such products has remained relatively small 
although the company believes the benefits of ivus imaging can be demonstrated  there can be no assurance that the benefits will be considered sufficient by the medical community to enable the company s products to achieve widespread market acceptance 
failure of the company s products to achieve market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see business products 
dependence on strategic relationships  reliance on cordis 
in february  endosonics and cordis entered into the exclusive distribution agreement pursuant to which cordis was granted the exclusive right to distribute endosonics ivus imaging products for coronary applications in north america  europe  africa and the middle east 
the exclusive distribution agreement supersedes and replaces a prior distribution agreement between cordis and endosonics and a prior distribution agreement between endosonics nederland bv  a wholly owned subsidiary of endosonics  and cordis sa cordis is obligated during each year of the exclusive distribution agreement to use reasonable efforts to purchase certain minimum annual amounts of products from endosonics 
subject to certain exceptions  cordis failure to meet the minimum annual purchase amount during any year of the exclusive distribution agreement shall constitute a material breach of such agreement 
cordis is also obligated during the term of the exclusive distribution agreement to undertake certain efforts to market  promote  distribute and sell endosonics ivus imaging products  including the provision of adequate personnel and facilities  the maintenance of sufficient inventory for demonstration purposes and the appointment of a united states and european intracoronary ultrasound marketing manager to interface with endosonics united states and european clinical and support staff 
the exclusive distribution agreement also contains standard representations and warranties of each party and standard provisions regarding indemnification  service and maintenance and confidentiality 
under the terms of the exclusive distribution agreement  cordis shall purchase ivus imaging products from endosonics at agreed upon prices set forth in such agreement  which prices shall be jointly reviewed by endosonics and cordis every six months 
the exclusive distribution agreement initially expires on december   but may be extended by the parties for successive one year periods 
the company currently believes that cordis is unlikely to meet the minimum purchase amounts required under the exclusive distribution agreement for fiscal and has engaged cordis in discussions that would lead to amendment or termination of the exclusive distribution agreement  although neither option can be assured 
the failure of cordis to meet minimum contractural purchase requirements in would have a material adverse effect on the company s operation results 
in  the company entered into similar agreements with affiliates of cordis covering japan and certain south american countries 
in light of the company s exclusive distribution relationship with cordis  the company s revenue from sales of ivus imaging products will depend substantially on the distribution capabilities of cordis 
further  in recent years there has been significant consolidation among medical device suppliers as the major suppliers have attempted to broaden their product lines in order to focus on product configurations that address a given procedure or treatment and in order to respond to cost pressures from health care providers 
this consolidation has made it increasingly difficult for smaller suppliers  such as the company  to effectively distribute their products without a major relationship with one of the major suppliers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its relationship with cordis or replace cordis in the event the company s relationship with cordis would be terminated 
in the event of such a termination  the company s ability to distribute its ivus imaging products would be materially adversely affected  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on new products  rapid technological change 
the medical device industry generally  and the ivus imaging device market in particular  are characterized by rapid technological change  changing customer needs  and frequent new product introductions 
the company s future success will depend upon its ability to develop and introduce new products that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of its customers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing new products that achieve market acceptance or that the company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of new products 
in october  the company announced the receipt of approval from the fda to market its five diagnostic catheters  which are designed to enhance image quality and reduce manufacturing cost relative to the company s oracle micro tm catheter line 
the company introduced the five diagnostic catheters in november and commenced commercial shipments of these catheters in the first quarter of there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not succeed in developing or marketing technologies and products that are more effective or commercially attractive than any that are being developed by the company  or that such competitors will not succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for introducing or commercializing any such products prior to the company 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the company s products will not be rendered obsolete as a result of future innovations 
see business products 
dependence on international sales 
the company derives  and expects to continue to derive  a significant portion of its revenue from international sales 
in   and  the company s international sales were million  million  and million respectively  or  and respectively of total revenue 
therefore  a significant portion of the company s revenues will continue to be subject to the risks associated with international sales  including economic or political instability  shipping delays  changes in applicable regulatory policies  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and various trade restrictions  all of which could have a significant impact on the company s ability to deliver products on a competitive and timely basis 
future imposition of  or significant increases in the level of  customs duties  import quotas or other trade restrictions  could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operation 
the regulation of medical devices  particularly in the european community  continues to expand and there can be no assurance that new laws or regulations will not have an adverse effect on the company 
suppliers 
the company purchases many standard and custom built components from independent suppliers  and contracts with third parties for certain specialized electronic component manufacturing processes 
most of these purchased components and processes are available from more than one vendor 
however  the manufacturing of the integrated circuit microchips  used in the five catheter line is currently performed by a single vendor 
although the company is in the process of identifying alternative vendors  the qualification of additional or replacement vendors for certain components or services is a lengthy process 
any supply interruption from this single source vendor would have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to manufacture its products until a new source of supply was qualified and  as a result  could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see business manufacturing and government regulation 
limitations on third party reimbursement 
in the united states  the company s products are purchased primarily by medical institutions  which then bill various third party payors  such as medicare  medicaid  and other government programs and private insurance plans  for the health care services provided to patients 
government agencies  private insurers and other payors determine whether to provide coverage for a particular procedure and reimburse hospitals for medical treatment at a fixed rate based on the drg established by the us hcfa 
the fixed rate of reimbursement is based on the procedure performed  and is unrelated to the specific devices used in that procedure 
if a procedure is not covered by a drg  payors may deny reimbursement 
in addition  some payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that the device used in a treatment was unnecessary  inappropriate or not cost effective  experimental or used for a non approved indication 
currently  there are no established drgs covering diagnostic ivus imaging procedures 
reimbursement of balloon angioplasty procedures is covered under a drg  but because the amount of reimbursement is fixed  the amount of potential profit relating to the procedure is reduced to the extent the physician performs additional procedures such as ivus imaging or uses a more expensive product which combines ivus imaging with therapeutic capabilities 
accordingly  physicians must determine that the clinical benefits of ivus imaging justify the additional cost 
although the company believes that less invasive procedures generally provide less costly overall therapies as compared to alternative surgical procedures  there can be no assurance that reimbursement for such less invasive procedures will continue to be available  or that future reimbursement policies of payors will not adversely affect the company s ability to sell its products on a profitable basis 
failure by hospitals and other users of the company s products to obtain reimbursement from third party payors  or changes in government and private third party payors policies toward reimbursement for procedures employing the company s products  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition 
competition in the market for devices used in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular and peripheral vascular disease is intense  and is expected to increase 
the interventional cardiology market is characterized by rapid technological innovation and change  and the company s products could be rendered obsolete as a result of future innovations 
the company s digital  all electronic ivus imaging catheters compete with mechanical ultrasound devices manufactured by cvis and hewlett packard 
both cvis and hewlett packard are significantly larger than the company  and have significantly greater financial  sales and marketing and technical resources available 
these competitors have also developed ivus imaging products with high quality images and the company believes that its competitive position is dependent upon its ability to establish its reputation as a producer of high quality ivus imaging products 
there can be no assurance that these companies are not currently developing  or will not attempt to develop  combination balloon angioplasty ivus imaging catheters that would compete with the company s combination balloon angioplasty ivus imaging products 
moreover  companies currently engaged in the manufacture and marketing of non imaging angioplasty catheters could attempt to expand their product lines to include combination balloon angioplasty ivus imaging products 
the company s combination balloon angioplasty ivus imaging catheters compete or will compete with therapeutic catheters marketed by a number of manufacturers  including acs  scimed  cordis  medtronic  inc and schneider usa  a subsidiary of pfizer  inc schneider 
such companies have substantial resources  established market positions  and significantly larger sales and marketing organizations 
in addition  the company faces competition from manufacturers of atherectomy devices  vascular stents and pharmaceutical products intended to treat cardiovascular disease 
see business competition 
reliance on patents and proprietary technology  risk of patent infringement 
the company holds six issued united states patents and has other united states and several foreign patent applications pending covering various aspects of its ivus imaging technology 
no assurance can be given  however  that the company s patent applications will issue as patents or that any issued patents will provide competitive advantages for the company s products or will not be successfully challenged or circumvented by its competitors 
although the company attempts to ensure that its products do not infringe other party s patents and proprietary rights  there can be no assurance that its products do not infringe such patents or rights 
the interventional cardiovascular market has been characterized by substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
the company is currently involved in litigation with intravasular research limited irl regarding certain of the company s technology 
in the event that any relevant claims of irl or other third party patents are upheld as valid and enforceable  the company could be prevented from practicing the subject matter claimed in such patents  or would be required to obtain licenses from the owners of any such patents or redesign its products or processes to avoid infringement 
there can be no assurance that such licenses would be available or  if available  would be so on terms acceptable to the company or that the company would be successful in any attempt to redesign its products or processes to avoid infringement 
the company also relies on trade secrets and proprietary technology and enters into confidentiality and non disclosure agreements with its employees and consultants 
there can be no assurance that the confidentiality of such trade secrets or proprietary information will be maintained by employees  consultants  advisors or others  or that the company s trade secrets or proprietary technology will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors in such a manner that the company has no practical recourse 
additional litigation may be necessary to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity  to enforce patents issued to the company or to protect trade secrets and could result in substantial cost to  and diversion of effort by  the company 
see business patents and proprietary technology and legal proceedings 
government regulation 
the manufacturing and marketing of the company s products are subject to extensive and rigorous government regulation in the united states and in other countries 
the company believes that its success will be significantly dependent upon commercial sales of improved versions of its imaging systems and catheter products 
the company will not be able to market these new products in the united states unless and until the company obtains approval from the fda 
if a medical device manufacturer can establish that a newly developed device is substantially equivalent to a device that was legally marketed prior to may  or to a device that the fda has found to be substantially equivalent to a legally marketed pre device  the manufacturer may seek clearance from the fda to market the device by filing a premarket notification with the fda under section k of the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act k 
there can be no assurance that k clearance for any future product or modification of an existing product will be granted or that the process will not be unduly lengthy 
all of the k clearances received for the company s catheters were based on substantial equivalence to legally marketed pre devices 
review of the substantially equivalent pre devices on which the k clearances for the company s catheters were based and any resulting restrictions on the company or requirements imposed to present additional data could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
if substantial equivalence cannot be established  or if the fda determines that the device or the particular application for the device requires a more rigorous review  the fda will require that the manufacturer submit a pma application that must be reviewed and approved by the fda prior to sales and marketing of the device in the united states 
the pma process is significantly more complex  expensive and time consuming than the k clearance process and frequently requires the submission of clinical data 
it is expected that certain of the company s combination angioplasty ivus imaging products under development will be subject to this pma process
