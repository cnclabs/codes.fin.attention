item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
sales and marketing the company employs its own marketing and sales staff as well as outside sales representative organizations to market andrea anti noise products and andrea s traditional intercom products 
in addition to the company s direct marketing and sales efforts  andrea anti noise products are also marketed through software publishers  distributors in the personal computer  telecommunications equipment  computer and consumer electronic retailers  and original equipment manufacturers 
under current collaborative agreements  the company s collaborative partners have various manufacturing  marketing  and sales rights to the products covered by the respective agreements 
while no assurance can be given  the company anticipates that it will enter into additional collaborative arrangements for its andrea anti noise and andrea dsp products 
market acceptance of the andrea anti noise and andrea dsp products is critical to the success of the company 
traditional intercom products are marketed to original equipment manufacturers  military organizations  and industrial customers 
manufacturing and assembly the company conducts assembly operations at its facility in new york and through subcontractors 
during initial production runs of andrea anti noise products  the products are assembled by the company at its new york facility from purchased components 
as sales of any particular andrea anti noise product increase  assembly operations are transferred to a subcontractor in asia 
most of the components for the andrea anti noise products are available from several sources and are not characteristically in short supply 
however  certain more specialized components for the andrea anti noise products  such as microphones  are available from a limited number of suppliers and subject to long lead times 
while the company has  to date  been able to obtain sufficient supplies of these more specialized components  no assurance can be given that it will continue to be able to do so 
shortages of  or interruptions in  the supply of these more specialized components could have a material adverse effect on the company s sales of andrea anti noise products 
traditional intercom products are assembled by the company at its new york facility from purchased components 
certain highly specialized components for the company s traditional intercom products sold for military and industrial use have limited sources of supply  the availability of which can affect particular projects of the company 
the company does not believe  however  that its earnings have been  or will be  materially affected if such components were unavailable 
competition the markets into which the company sells its andrea anti noise products and its traditional line of military and industrial products are highly competitive 
competition in these markets is based on varying combinations of product features  quality and reliability of performance  price  sales  marketing and technical support  ease of use  compatibility with evolving industry standards and other systems and equipment  name recognition  and development of new products and enhancements 
most of the company s current and potential competitors in these markets have significantly greater financial  marketing  technical  and other resources than the company 
consequently  these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the development  marketing  and sale of their products than the company 
no assurance can be given that one or more of these competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company s technology 
in the markets for its traditional products  the company often competes with major defense electronics corporations as well as smaller manufacturing firms which specialize in supplying to specific military initiatives 
the company s performance in this market is further subject to several factors  including dependence on government appropriations  the time required for design and development  the complexity of product design  the rapidity with which product designs and technology become obsolete  the intense competition for available business  and the acceptability of manufacturing contracts by government inspectors 
the company believes that its ability to compete successfully will depend upon its capability to develop and maintain advanced technology  develop proprietary products  attract and retain qualified personnel  obtain patent or other proprietary protection for its products and technologies  and manufacture  assemble and successfully market products  either alone or through third parties 
employees the company employed persons at december   of which were production workers and technicians  were members of the engineering staff  and were concerned with administrative and sales duties 
none of the employees are unionized or covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
the company believes that it generally enjoys good relations with its employees

balance sheet data long term capital lease obligations    long term obligations  including current portions      retained earnings deficit      total assets      item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview andrea electronics corporation s mission is to provide state of the art communications products for the voice activated  natural language driven  human machine interface markets that are rapidly emerging from the convergence of the telecommunications and computer industries  and for the defense electronics markets that are requiring increasingly higher quality voice communication products 
the company s strategy for serving these markets is to leverage its expertise in audio communications technology  including its patented andrea anti noise active noise cancellation anc and andrea anti noise active noise reduction anr technologies  and to continue developing  manufacturing and marketing a line of andrea anti noise headsets  handsets and other communication devices to cost effectively enhance voice communications for end users of the growing number of new  voice based computer and computer telephony applications and interfaces 
in addition  to extend the company s position in technology enhancing communications  the company has begun to develop its andrea dsp products based on digital signal processing technology 
examples of the applications and interfaces for which andrea anti noise products provide benefit include internet and other computer based speech  telephony communications  multi point conferencing  multi player internet and cd rom interactive games  speech recognition  multimedia  military and industrial communications  and other applications and interfaces that incorporate natural language processing 
the company believes that end users of these applications and interfaces will require high quality microphone and earphone products that enhance voice transmission  particularly to and from noisy environments  for use with personal computers  business and residential telephones  military headsets  cellular and other wireless telephones  personal communication systems and avionics communications systems 
high quality audio communication technologies will also be required for emerging far field voice applications  ranging from continuous speech dictation  to multiparty video teleconferencing and collaboration  to natural language driven interfaces for automobiles  home and office automation and other machines and devices into which voice controlled microprocessors are expected to be introduced during the next several years 
an important element of the company s strategy for expanding the channels of distribution and broadening the base of users for its products is its set of collaborative arrangements with software publishers  distributors and retailers actively engaged in the various markets in which the company s products have application  and hardware oems 
under some of these arrangements  the company supplies its products for sale by the collaborative partners 
under others  the collaborative partners supply the company with software that the company includes with its products 
in addition  the company is also seeking to increase its own direct marketing efforts 
the company outsources the manufacturing of andrea anti noise products for its oem  consumer and commercial customers 
the company also manufactures and distributes intercom systems and related components for military applications and industrial applications traditional military products 
in contrast to the outsourced manufacturing of its andrea anti noise products for the non military markets  the company continues to manufacture its traditional products in its own facility 
to the extent that the company succeeds in developing a new line of products for military use that incorporate anc and anr technology  management anticipates that it will manufacture these new military products through both outsourcing and self manufacturing 
cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements certain information contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the year ended december  and other items set forth in this report on form k are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the words believe  expect  anticipate and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
in order to obtain the benefits of these safe harbor provisions for any such forward looking statements  the company wishes to caution investors and prospective investors about the following significant factors  which  among others  have in some cases affected the company s actual results and are in the future likely to affect the company s actual results and could cause them to differ materially from those expressed in any such forward looking statements 
these factors include the rate at which the company s anti noise technology is accepted by the diverse range of users and applications within the global communications and informatics marketplace  the ability of the company to maintain a competitive position for its andrea anti noise products in terms of technical specifications  quality  price  reliability and service and to develop similarly competitive andrea dsp products  which ability will require the company to have sufficient funds to expend on research and development  the ongoing ability of the company to enter into and maintain collaborative relationships with larger companies in the fields of telecommunications  computer manufacturing  software design and publishing  internet and online services  defense related manufacturers and system providers  and retail and direct marketing distributors  and in the event that the company experiences continued significant growth in demand for andrea anti noise products  the ability of the company to raise sufficient external capital to fund the working capital requirements for meeting such demand 
the failure of the company to surmount the challenges posed by any one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and growth 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales sales for the year ended december  were  an increase of over sales of  for the year ended december  the increase primarily reflects increasing market acceptance of andrea anti noise products for providing the technology enhanced audio signals required for voice driven computer applications  coupled with new product launches that were particularly strong in the latter half of due to retail introduction of several of the company s products 
for the year ended december   sales from andrea anti noise products comprised approximately of total sales  while sales from the company s traditional military products comprised approximately of total sales 
cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the year ended december  decreased to from for the year ended december  the improvement during principally reflects the efficiencies resulting from the company s continuing efforts to globalize its sourcing and manufacturing activities  as well as maximizing the benefits of shifts in product mix 
also contributing to the improvement is the higher gross margins realized as a result of the retail introduction of the company s products during the latter half of research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december  this increase is primarily related to technological investments that resulted in new product launches during management believes increases in research and development will continue throughout  with the expectation of several new product launches in order to continue providing state of the art communications products for the various voice interface markets 
general  administrative and selling expenses general  administrative and selling expenses for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december  this increase  primarily attributable to andrea anti noise products  reflects increased business development expenses related to existing and prospective collaborative arrangements with hardware oems  software publishers  distributors and retailers 
in addition  the company incurred increased promotional  marketing and sales expenses to promote product awareness and acceptance of the andrea antinoise product line 
as a percentage of sales  however  general  administrative and selling expenses decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  in light of the company s intention to introduce and support additional product launches during  the company expects to at least maintain and likely increase general  administrative and selling expenses  in terms of both absolute dollars and relative percentage of sales 
other income expense other income for the year ended december  was  compared to other expense of  for the year ended december  this change is primarily attributable to decreases in interest expense as a result of conversion rights exercised during  and the lower effective interest rate on the outstanding convertible debentures during fiscal provision for income taxes the income tax expense of  for the year ended december  resulted from the effect of a provision for income taxes at the company s effective income tax rate  substantially offset by a reduction in the company s reserve on previously generated  fully reserved deferred income tax assets 
as a part of the normal assessment of the company s reserves  management determined that it has become more likely than not that a portion of the previously reserved deferred tax assets will be realized and has  accordingly  reduced the valuation allowance on those previously reserved deferred tax assets 
this determination is based on the company s profitability in recent quarters and the impact of the sales performance of its products 
realization of remaining reserved deferred tax assets at december   if and when realized  will not result in a tax benefit in the consolidated statement of operations  but will result in an increase in additional paid in capital as they are related to tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options 
the income tax benefit of  for the year ended december  represented benefit generated from the loss as well as a reduction of the valuation allowance on previously reserved deferred tax assets at december  see note to the financial statements 
net income loss net income for the year ended december  was  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  the improvement principally reflects the factors described above 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales sales for the year ended december  were  an increase of nearly over sales of  for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to a sharp increase in demand for andrea anti noiseproducts 
this increase was partially offset by an expected decrease in sales of the company s traditional military products 
sales of andrea anti noise products comprised a majority portion of total sales of the company in  and  while no assurance can be given  management anticipates another increase in sales of these products in for the year ended december   sales from the company s anti noise product line comprised approximately of total sales while sales from the company s traditional military products comprised approximately of total sales 
cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the year ended december  increased to from for the year ended december  the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the year ended december  reflects increased costs associated with initial production runs in the company s new york facilities of andrea anti noise products introduced during the first six months of research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december  management believes that research and development will increase as the company further develops and augments it andrea anti noise technology and product lines 
general  administrative and selling expenses general  administrative and selling expenses for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december  the increase for the year ended december  reflects the marketing and sales expenses  such as advertising  packaging and promotional expenses  associated with the company s marketing  introduction  and promotion of andrea anti noise products to oems  distributors  value added resellers and end users 
operating loss operating loss for the year ended december  decreased to  from  for the year ended december  this decline in operating loss reflects the increase in sales for the year ended december   offset by the increase in general  administrative and selling expenses associated with increased business development and marketing expenses 
other income expense other expense for the year ended december  was  versus other income of  for the year ended december  this reversal resulted from an increase of  in interest expense associated with the company s subordinated convertible debentures and the decrease in interest income of  resulting from the company s average lower cash and cash equivalents throughout the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  these lower levels of cash and cash equivalents reflected the increased use of cash by the company to secure components and supplies for the manufacture of anti noise products 
net loss net loss for the year ended december  was  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  this reduction in net loss reflects principally the factors described above and the income tax benefit associated with a the current year loss and b changes in the reserves provided against previous income tax benefits 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal sources of funds have historically been  and are expected to continue to be  cash flow from operations and borrowings provided by certain financial institutions 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  compared with  at december  the company expects to realize cash proceeds during the second quarter of from the sale of its facility in long island city  new york 
see item properties 
working capital at december  was  compared to  at december  the increase in working capital reflects an increase in total current assets of  offset by an increase in total current liabilities of  the increase in total current assets principally reflects an increase in cash of  an increase in accounts receivable of  an increase in inventory of  an decrease in deferred income taxes of  and an increase of  in prepaid expenses and other current assets 
the increase in current liabilities principally reflects a  increase in trade accounts payable  a  increase in convertible debentures and a  increase in other current liabilities 
the increase in cash of  reflects  of net cash used in operating activities   of cash used in investing activities and  of cash provided by financing activities 
the principal operating activities  excluding non cash charges  for which cash was used were the increases in inventory and accounts receivable as a result of the significant demand for the company s andrea anti noise products 
the cash used in investing activities is a result of the maturity of one of the company s marketable securities  offset by capital expenditures  primarily comprised of the ongoing upgrade of manufacturing dies and molds for andrea anti noise products  as well as investments in the company s existing information systems 
the cash provided by financing activities resulted from the exercise of stock options 
the increase in accounts receivable primarily reflects the significant increase in sales during generally  the company collects receivables from sales within three months 
the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily includes increases in deferred advertising costs  as well as the recognition of increased premiums for prepaid property taxes and insurance  increased fulfillment costs associated with global marketing and sales expansion  and increases in other service costs related to future periods 
the increase in deferred tax assets represents a further reduction of the valuation allowance on previously reserved deferred tax assets in light of the company s profitability over recent quarters and the expectation of realizing those assets through continued earnings 
the company will be continually re assessing its remaining reserves on deferred income tax assets as the year progresses 
the increase in trade accounts payable primarily reflects differences in the timing related to both the payments for and the acquisition of raw materials for andrea anti noise products 
demand for andrea anti noise products has required the company to raise additional working capital to support its production operations 
in december  april and august  the company raised additional working capital through the issuance of convertible subordinated debentures 
in addition  the company entered into a revolving credit agreement in september that provides maximum borrowings of up to million based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory  as defined 
at december   there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility 
notwithstanding growth in sales of andrea anti noise products during the year ended december   no assurance can be given that demand will continue to increase for these products or any of the company s other products or  that if such demand does increase  that the company will be able to obtain the necessary working capital to increase production and marketing resources to meet such demand on favorable terms  or at all 
in july  the emerging issues task force of the financial accounting standards board reached a consensus on issue  accounting for the costs associated with modifying computer software for the year  which requires that costs associated with modifying computer software for the year be expensed as incurred 
the company believes  based upon its internal reviews and other factors  that future external and internal costs to be incurred relating to the modification of internal use software for the year will not have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial position
