item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations farmers capital bank corporation the company recorded net income of million or per share for  up from million or per share reported for the increase in earnings is primarily due to the reduction of the provision for loan losses of the company s bank subsidiaries and the reduction of the overhead expenses of the company s former consumer finance subsidiary in the amount of million and thousand  respectively  net of tax 
return on average assets increased from to and return on average equity increased from to 
interest income total interest income on a tax equivalent basis was million  equaling the results posted for interest on investment securities decreased thousand 
this is made up of a decrease of thousand on taxable investment securities and an increase of on nontaxable investment securities 
the decrease in interest earned on taxable investment securities is primarily attributed to the million dollar decrease in the average balance 
the average rate earned on these securities increased from to 
the increase in interest earned on nontaxable investment securities is primarily due to the increase in the average balance 
the average rate earned on these investment securities increased from to 
interest on time deposits with banks  federal funds sold  and securities purchased under agreements to resell totaled million  a decrease of thousand or 
the decrease is due primarily to the decrease in the average balances 
interest and fees on loans increased slightly from million to million 
the increase is due to a combination of the change in both volume and rate 
average loans increased million while the average rate earned on those loans decreased from to 
interest expense total interest expense decreased million or from the decrease is primarily due to the million decrease in interest expense on time deposits  which totaled million at year end interest expense on time deposits decreased as a result of reductions in both volume and rate 
average time deposits decreased million or  while the average rate paid decreased basis points to 
interest expense on other interest bearing liabilities increased thousand to million at december  net interest income is the most significant component of the company s earnings 
net interest income is the excess of the interest income earned on assets over the interest paid for funds to support those assets

interest income was relatively unchanged while interest expense decreased million 
the change in the spread between rates earned and paid and net interest margin are summarized below change spread between rates earned and paid net interest margin the increase in the net interest spread and the net interest margin are primarily due to a decrease in interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
as seen in the interest rates and interest differential table  less interest expense was incurred in on lower average interest bearing liabilities 
this  combined with interest income on earning assets that remained relatively unchanged  produced the increased margin and spread

each subsidiary determines its level for the allowance and maintains it at an amount believed to be sufficient to absorb possible losses that may be experienced in the credit portfolio 
the following factors are used in establishing an appropriate allowance a careful assessment of the financial condition of individual borrowers a realistic determination of the value and adequacy of underlying collateral a thorough review of historical loss experience the condition of the local economy a comprehensive analysis of the levels and trends of loan categories a review of delinquent and classified loans the provision for loan losses decreased million in compared to the company had net charge offs of million  down million from million in the allowance was of net loans  relatively unchanged from at the end of management believes the current reserve is adequate to cover any potential future losses within the loan portfolio 
management also continues to emphasize collection efforts and evaluation of risks within the portfolio

the largest reductions have been in other real estate owned and restructured loans 
other real estate owned has decreased million  or and restructured loans have decreased million  or since this trend is the result of management s continued efforts to improve the quality of the loan portfolio

these funds help in the management of liquidity and interest rate sensitivity 
in  temporary investments averaged million  a decrease of million  or from their average in temporary investment funds are reallocated as loan demand presents the opportunity 
investment securities the majority of the investment securities portfolio is comprised of us treasury securities  federal agency securities  tax exempt securities  and mortgage backed securities 
total investment securities were million on december   a decrease of million  or from year end the funds made available from maturing or called bonds have been redirected to fund new loan growth as needed 
remaining funds have been used to increase the company s holding of tax free obligations and mortgage backed securities 
obligations of states and political subdivisions are the primary means of managing the company s tax position 
the alternative minimum tax is not expected to impact the company s ability to acquire tax free obligations in the near future as they become available at an attractive yield 
available for sale securities and held to maturity securities were million and million  respectively

deposits on december   deposits totaled million  an increase of million  or from year end deposits averaged million in  virtually unchanged from during total average interest bearing deposits decreased million  or to million while average noninterest bearing deposits increased million  or to million 
the primary decrease in interest bearing deposits is due to an million decrease in average time deposits

effects of inflation the majority of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
therefore  the company differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in nonmonetary assets  such as fixed assets and inventories 
however  inflation does have an important impact on the growth of assets in the banking industry and on the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation also affects other expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
management believes the most significant impact on financial and operating results is the company s ability to react to changes in interest rates 
management seeks to maintain an essentially balanced position between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against the effects of wide interest rate fluctuations 
liquidity the liquidity of the company is dependent on the receipt of dividends from its subsidiary banks see note to the consolidated financial statements 
management expects that in the aggregate  its subsidiary banks will continue to have the ability to dividend adequate funds to the company 
the company s objective as it relates to liquidity is to ensure that subsidiary banks have funds available to meet deposit withdrawals and credit demands without unduly penalizing profitability 
in order to maintain a proper level of liquidity  the banks have several sources of funds available on a daily basis which can be used for liquidity purposes 
those sources of funds are the subsidiary banks core deposits consisting of both business and non business deposits cash flow generated by repayment of loan principal and interest federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase for the longer term  the liquidity position is managed by balancing the maturity structure of the balance sheet 
this process allows for an orderly flow of funds over an extended period of time 
liquid assets consist of cash and due from banks  short term investments  and securities available for sale 
at december   such assets totaled million 
for the year ended december   cash and due from banks increased million to million compared with an million increase during the previous year period 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased million in the comparison 
net cash used in investing activities increased million 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million for the year  compared to million in interest rate sensitivity since it is extremely difficult to accurately predict interest rate movements  it is management s intention to maintain the cumulative interest sensitivity gap at the one year time frame between plus or minus of total earning assets 
the gap position may be managed by purchasing investment securities with a maturity date within the desired time frame  offering interest rate incentives to encourage loan customers to choose the desired maturity  and offering interest rate incentives to encourage deposit customers to choose the desired maturity 
the following chart illustrates interest rate sensitivity at december  for various time periods 
the purpose of this gap chart is to measure interest rate risk utilizing the repricing intervals of the interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
rising interest rates are likely to increase net interest income in a positive gap position while falling interest rates are beneficial in a negative gap position 
the company has a negative gap position through twelve months  but then shifts to a positive gap position between one and five years 
this positioning is due to management s anticipated economic outlook and other competitive factors

year compliance the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the year approaches 
the year problem arises when computer programs use two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
some systems may treat the year as the year this could result in a major system failure or miscalculations 
a number of computer systems which are affected by the year are utilized by the company to operate its day to day business 
most of these systems use software developed by and licensed from third party software vendors 
the company is utilizing both internal and external resources to identify  correct  and test the company s systems for year compliance 
the company is actively managing all of its third party software vendors to determine that software corrections and warranty commitments are obtained 
the company believes that mission critical applications are year compliant 
most of the systems testing will be completed in  with the remainder scheduled to be completed during the first quarter of the company believes that the costs associated with year compliance will be absorbed in routine annual software maintenance contracts and are not likely to be incremental costs to the company 
the company does not anticipate future material expenditures in order to become year compliant
