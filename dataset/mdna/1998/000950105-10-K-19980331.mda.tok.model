inflation and foreign exchange fluctuation the company believes that inflation has not had a material effect on its business  operating results or financial condition during the three year period ended december  while the company does not believe that its business is highly sensitive to inflation  there can be no assurance that future increases in the rate of inflation would not have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
the company is currently not exposed to foreign exchange risk because foreign sales are denominated in us dollars to us based trading companies 
the company may seek to manage any such future risk by entering into foreign exchange contracts as management deems appropriate 
year the company continues to assess its exposure related to the impact of the year date issue 
the year date issue arises from the fact that many computer programs use only two digits to identify a year in a date field  thus computer programs having time sensitive software will recognize a date using as the year rather than the year the company s key financial and operational systems are being reviewed and  where required  detailed plans have been  or are being developed and implemented on a schedule intended to permit the corporation s computer systems and products to continue to function properly 
this effort has been combined with the upgrading or replacement of current computer systems for infrastructure and technology enhancement reasons 
maintenance or modification costs will be expensed as incurred  while the costs of new information technology will be capitalized and amortized in accordance with company policy 
management does not believe the costs associated with the information systems upgrades will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  the company could be adversely impacted by the year date issue if suppliers  customers and other businesses do not address this issue successfully 
management continues to assess these risks and ensure year compliance from the company s suppliers and customers in order to reduce the impact on the company 
factors that may affect future performance substantial price competition  margin maintenance and prices of raw materials

copper rod is the principal raw material used in the company s manufacturing operations  accounting for approximately of cost of goods sold for the year ended december  the company expects that copper will continue to account for a significant portion of the cost of goods sold in the future 
historically  the price of copper has fluctuated significantly ie between and  and and per pounds in and  respectively 
the company s other principal raw materials include steel and aluminum  which collectively accounted for approximately of cost of goods sold for the year ended december  although in the past these raw materials have not been subject to the same degree of price volatility as copper  there can be no assurance that significant fluctuations will not occur in the future 
the company attempts to insulate its products from these price fluctuations through improved purchasing procedures and appropriate selling price adjustments 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to maintain acceptable gross profit margins on product sales in the future and  if it is unable to do so  its business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
the company does not currently engage in metal futures trading or other hedging activities  but does have a producer supply contract  which currently expires on december  and under which the company purchases copper in any given month at a price equal to the average copper selling prices  as determined by the new york commodity exchange  for the month of shipment plus a premium 
in addition  the company has an aluminum supply contract which expires on december  that provides for technical assistance and other special terms 
the company may engage in hedging activities in the future as management deems appropriate 
management of growth

the company s ability to compete effectively and to manage future growth  if any  will depend on its ability to continue to implement and improve operational  financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to expand  train  motivate and manage its work force

the company intends to supplement its growth by pursuing selective acquisitions of companies with products complementary to its existing business 
during the year ended december   the company acquired four companies and intends to consider future acquisitions in the industry  some of which may be material to the company 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies and products  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which the company has no or limited direct prior experience  operating companies in different geographical locations  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
future acquisitions by the company could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  which could materially adversely affect the company s operating results and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that future acquisitions can be successfully integrated or that management will be successful in managing the combined operations

volatility of new construction market 
the volatility of the nonresidential new construction market has a direct impact on sales of certain of the company s products 
certain regions of the united states have experienced  and in the future may experience  significant economic recessions that have reduced  or may reduce  the number of nonresidential new construction projects  which in turn could adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company has historically derived a substantial portion of its sales from the building modernization market  which has not been significantly adversely affected by downturns in the nonresidential new construction market 
there can be no assurance  however  that the modernization market will not enter a downturn or that the company s sales will not be affected by future downturns in the nonresidential new construction market

there can be no assurance that such conditions will not have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results in the future 
competition 
the company faces competition from a number of national and regional competitors  both in the armored cable and pipe and wire industries  some of which have greater financial  engineering  research and development  manufacturing and other resources than the company 
the company s competitors can be expected to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive price and performance characteristics 
although the company believes that it has certain technological and other advantages over its competitors  maintaining and leveraging any such advantages will require continued investment by the company in design and engineering  development  marketing and customer service and support

although the company believes that the loss of any one representative would not have a material adverse impact on the company s business  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its existing relationships with these representatives 
in addition  the distributors which ultimately sell the company s products could purchase and distribute products that compete with the company s products or cease purchasing the company s products at any time 
there can be no assurance that the distributors will continue to distribute or recommend the company s products or do so successfully 
dependence on key management personnel

papitto  the company s chairman and chief executive officer  robert r 
wheeler  the company s president and chief operating officer  and raymond h 
keller  the company s chief financial officer
