and alamac 
the fiscal results include six weeks of operations of alamac  which was acquired as of august  the fiscal results include operating results from ique inc effective april  during fiscal  the domestic circular knit industry was characterized by accelerating consolidation and a supply demand imbalance that adversely affected the company s results of operations 
the company experienced weakness in sales and margins in both fleece and jersey fabrics 
competition from imports increased as global sourcing patterns continued to shift between the far east and the west 
unstable  often faltering economies in the far east forced many textile and apparel manufacturers in the region to offer products to us markets at reduced prices 
these low prices were made even more attractive to us retailers by significant and prolonged currency devaluations in several countries 
the duration of these market conditions  evidenced by additional  if not an excessive  supply of low priced imports is uncertain 
nonetheless  management of the company believes that current conditions will continue  at a minimum  throughout fiscal in response to these business conditions  dyersburg has broadened its price point offerings  reduced costs  and focused on providing a continuous flow of value added and differentiated products to remain efficient and competitive 
the company entered fiscal with many opportunities and challenges from its recent acquisition of alamac 
dyersburg has traditionally maintained a focus on efficiency and profitability 
the company s business plan is to reposition the alamac division  which was suffering from a too large  complex and inefficient product line in addition to an overburdened cost structure

after rationalizing non profitable product lines and reducing fixed costs  the company believes alamac is now better prepared to meet any potential upturn in its business with streamlined facilities and a stronger profit potential

inflation similar to other textile and apparel manufacturers  the company is dependent on the prices and supplies of certain principal raw materials including cotton  acrylic and polyester fibers 
during  raw material prices for polyester and acrylic stabilized after significant increases in and early  while prices for cotton continued to increase 
during and prices for both cotton and polyester declined 
the long term impact of subsequent raw material price fluctuations on the company s performance is  however  uncertain 
the company intends to support margins through continued efforts to improve its product mix and improve product pricing as market conditions permit 
year the company has determined that it will need to modify or replace portions of its software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and beyond 
the company also has initiated discussions with its significant suppliers  large customers and financial institutions to ensure that those parties have appropriate plans to remediate year issues where their systems interface with the company s systems or otherwise impact its operations 
the company s comprehensive year initiative is being managed by a team of internal staff 
the team s activities are designed to ensure that there is no adverse effect on the company s core business operations and that transactions with customers  suppliers and financial institutions are fully supported 
the company is well underway with these efforts 
the company s business application programs are currently compliant or will be made compliant through the year project 
the few remaining non compliant programs are to be brought into compliance by the vendors that will supply the programs or through modifications by internal staff 
the majority of the business applications year project is scheduled to be completed by december   with a few software programs scheduled to be replaced in early the company continues to follow up with critical suppliers and customers concerning their plans and progress in addressing the year problem 
the costs of the year project are not expected to be material to the company s results of operations or financial position and are being expensed as incurred 
these costs represent the labor costs of time allocated from existing internal staff 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
risk management the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
to reduce such risks  the company selectively uses financial instruments 
all such hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined procedures  which strictly prohibit the use of financial instruments for trading purposes

interest rates at october   the fair value of the company s total debt was estimated at million using yields obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of borrowing arrangements and taking into consideration the underlying terms of the debt 
such fair value is less than the carrying value of debt at october  by million 
market risk is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates 
using a yield to maturity analysis and assuming an increase in interest rates of from october  the potential decrease in fair value of total debt would be million 
the company had million of variable rate debt outstanding at october   with interest rate swaps in place to offset the variability of million of this balance 
at this borrowing level  a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates  considering the effect of the interest rate hedge agreements  would have approximately a  unfavorable impact on the company s net income and cash flows 
commodities the availability and price of cotton  which represents approximately of raw materials  are subject to wide fluctuations due to unpredictable factors such as weather  plantings  government farm programs and policies  and changes in global production 
to reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations the company from time to time will enter into long term purchase contracts 
at october   the company had commitments to purchase approximately million of cotton through july representing approximately of estimated fiscal requirements 
the above risk management discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the sensitivity analyses are forward looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur 
actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected due to actual developments in the market
