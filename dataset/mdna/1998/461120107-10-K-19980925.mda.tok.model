results of operations overview intertan is engaged in the sale of consumer electronics products primarily through company operated retail stores and dealer outlets in canada  the united kingdom and australia 
the company s retail operations are conducted through three wholly owned subsidiaries intertan australia ltd  which operates in australia under the trade name tandy electronics  intertan canada ltd  which operates in canada under the trade name radioshack  and intertan uk limited  which operates in the united kingdom under the tandy trade name

united kingdom restructuring plan as part of its ongoing efforts to improve the financial performance of its united kingdom operation  the company carried out a review of the performance of all of its stores in the united kingdom 
as a consequence of that review  in january   a plan to close consistently under performing stores was approved 
in connection with this restructuring plan  a provision of  was recorded during the third quarter of fiscal year  reflecting lease disposal costs  severance costs  and other closure costs  including fixture removal and contract termination costs 
as a result of the store closure plan  the company implemented an inventory clearance program designed to liquidate  in a relatively short time frame  a significant portion of the inventory from the stores to be closed 
the clearance program was conducted through clearance stores selected from the list of stores to be closed 
these clearance stores were open for varying lengths of time during the third and fourth quarters 
as a consequence of this program  a provision of  was recorded to write down the inventory in the clearance centers to estimated net realizable value 
this amount has been included in cost of products sold and is in addition to the restructuring provision discussed above 
as of june   all stores  including the clearance stores  had closed and substantially all inventory identified for clearance had been sold 
all employees affected had either been reassigned within the company or terminated 
a total of eight of the stores identified for closure had leases which expired prior to june  the remaining stores have lease terms remaining of varying periods up to years 
a national firm of real estate brokers has been engaged to assist in arranging for the sublet or assignment of these leases to other parties 
provision has been made for management s best estimate of the costs of disposing of these leases 
the overall economy and other factors affecting the property market in the united kingdom could cause the actual lease disposal costs to differ from management s estimates and result in future adjustments 
management originally estimated that approximately jobs would be lost as a result of this store closure program 
as of june   approximately individuals had been terminated 
the difference results from unforeseen attrition 
sales from the closed stores during the  and fiscal years were   and  respectively 
the operating losses during the same three years were   and  respectively 
management believes that the closure of these underperforming stores will improve operations in the united kingdom 
management will continue to evaluate a variety of operational and strategic initiatives in an effort to mitigate demands placed on consolidated cash resources and improve the return on consolidated stockholders equity 
however  there can be no assurance that such action will result in an operating profit in the united kingdom 
sales outlets the geographic distribution of the company s sales outlets is summarized in the following table fiscal year june ending opened closed canada company operated dealer australia company operated dealer united kingdom company operated dealer total company operated   dealer in addition  the company operated and stores on behalf of rogers cantel inc during fiscal years and  respectively 
the dealers included in the preceding table are independent retail businesses which operate under their own trade names but are permitted  under dealer agreements  to purchase any of the products sold by intertan company stores 
the dealer agreements contain a license permitting the dealer to designate the consumer electronics department of the dealer s business as a radioshack dealer  a tandy dealer  or a tandy electronics dealer  as applicable 
sales to dealers accounted for approximately  and of total sales during fiscal years  and  respectively 
the decrease in the number of dealers in all three countries is primarily attributable to programs designed to eliminate dealers that were not purchasing product in sufficient quantities to make them profitable to the company 
the reduction in the number of dealers is not expected to have a material effect on sales 
the company intends to continue to explore opportunities to expand its dealer base to produce sales from communities too small to support company operated stores 
during fiscal year  the company entered into an agreement in canada with rogers cantel inc cantel to operate telecommunications stores cantel stores on its behalf 
the first of these stores was opened in august  and at june   stores were in operation 
under the terms of this agreement  cantel leases the store and is responsible for fixed costs  including rent and realty taxes 
the company purchases certain inventory from cantel and receives a commission on certain sales 
since these locations are not company owned  they are not included in the above table 
intertan s business is seasonal  sales peak in the november december christmas selling season 
the company s cash flow requirements are also seasonal since inventories build prior to the christmas selling season 
significant inventory growth for all operations typically begins to build in late summer and peaks in november 
since the impact of the fluctuations of local country currencies against the us dollar can be significant  the following analysis of the income and expense categories is based both on amounts expressed in us dollars and as a percent of sales 
profit and loss accounts  including sales  are translated from local currency values to us dollars at the monthly average exchange rates 
during fiscal year  the us dollar strengthened against the canadian and australian dollars 
as a result  the same local currency amounts translate into fewer us dollars as compared with the prior year 
for example  if local currency sales of the australian operation in fiscal were equal to those in fiscal  the fiscal income statement would reflect a decrease in sales when reported in us dollars 
on the other hand  during fiscal year the us dollar weakened modestly against the us pound sterling 
consequently  in the united kingdom  the same local currency amounts translated into more us dollars in fiscal year as compared with fiscal year the following table outlines the percentage change in the weighted average exchange rates of the currencies of the countries in which the company operates relative to the us dollar as compared to the prior year canada australia united kingdom net sales and operating revenues net sales and operating revenues sales in us dollars increased by  in fiscal year  an increase of over fiscal year the impact on sales of weaker australian and canadian dollars had a significant effect on this comparison 
with all currency rate effects eliminated  including the effects of a stronger pound sterling  sales increased by 
this sales increase was driven by a comparative store sales gain  as the company closed a net of company operated stores  primarily as a result of the store closure program in the united kingdom 
see united kingdom restructuring plan 
the following table illustrates the total percentage sales increase decrease by geographic area as measured in us dollars and local currencies sales increase decrease us dollars year ended june percentage change canada australia united kingdom local currencies year ended june canada australia united kingdom the following table illustrates comparative company operated store sales measured at comparable exchange rates comparative company operated store sales year ended june percentage change canada australia united kingdom consolidated derived from the accumulation of each store s monthly sales in local currency for those months in which it was open both in the current and preceding year 
comparative store sales increased during fiscal year as a whole by  with increases being experienced in all four quarters 
the year finished strongly with double digit comparative store sales gains being achieved in all three of the company s markets during both the third and fourth quarters 
the company s strategy for building sales throughout fiscal year was to actively pursue the growth opportunities presented by certain key categories with high consumer demand and which fit the company s market niche 
targeted product categories included cellular  telephones and accessories  in particular cordless models  computers  personal electronics and  in canada  direct to home satellite systems 
the success of this strategy was particularly evident in canada and australia where these promotional efforts produced gains in a wide range of product categories 
the company s operations in each of these locations have established significant market share in the telephone and related product categories 
the company has become a leader in the sale of fax machines and direct to home satellite systems in australia and canada  respectively 
the company s cantel relationship in canada continues to give it a significant cellular presence 
in the united kingdom  sales growth came primarily from the sale of cellular products 
in that market  the company s conveniently located chain of stores  together with its customer profile  proved to be a major retail outlet for the newer prepaid airtime models 
the ongoing sale of renewal airtime cards not only increased sales  but also contributed to improved store traffic 
similar cellular product offerings have recently been introduced in canada and australia and are proving to be popular in those countries as well 
sales efforts also continued to focus on the important parts and accessories category in all three of the company s markets 
sales in us dollars increased by  in fiscal year  an increase of over fiscal year during that year  the effects of a stronger australian dollar and pound sterling were partially offset by a weaker canadian dollar 
measured at the same exchange rates  sales increased by 
this increase was more than explained by a net increase in the store count of three stores and by the opening of cantel stores in canada 
comparative store sales declined by during fiscal year there were a number of factors contributing to this soft sales performance 
in canada  there were indications of consumer resistance to the pricing of computers 
the cellular market  for varying reasons  was also soft in all three of the company s markets 
sales in us dollars increased by  in fiscal year  an increase of over fiscal year the impact on sales of stronger australian and canadian dollars was partially offset by a weaker pound sterling 
measured at the same exchange rates  sales increased by 
an increase of company operated stores was an important factor in this improved performance 
comparative store sales increased by during fiscal year management does not believe that inflation or price changes have had a material effect on sales during fiscal years  or gross profit the effect of higher sales during fiscal year was partially offset by a decline in the gross margin percentage and foreign currency rate effects 
the following analysis summarizes the components of the increase in gross profit over that experienced in fiscal year in thousands higher sales  lower gross margin percentage  foreign currency rate effects  the following table illustrates gross profit as a percentage of sales  by geographic area as a percentage of sales canada australia united kingdom consolidated the gross profit percentage for fiscal year declined from a year ago to  a reduction of percentage points 
as discussed under net sales and operating revenues  the company experienced strong sales improvement during fiscal by aggressively pursuing strategic growth opportunities 
however  with the exception of batteries and parts and accessories  the categories which presented sales growth potential tended to carry less than the company s average margins 
this is true in particular of cellular products in all three countries and direct to home satellite systems in canada 
in addition  the write down of inventories of  associated with the store closure program in the united kingdom accounted for almost one half of the decline in the gross margin percentage in that country 
see united kingdom restructuring plan 
management continues to actively pursue a number of initiatives intended to have a positive impact on the gross margin percentage 
these include an ongoing emphasis on the sale of parts and accessories and broadening the range in this important category  developing strategic relationships with suppliers offering a stream of residual income associated with the sale of a particular product or service and aggressively pursuing opportunities to grow sales of extended warranty programs 
however  management believes that future sales growth opportunities will continue to come primarily from categories with lower than the company s average margins 
this trend will continue to put pressure on the company s margins 
during fiscal year  the gross margin percentage increased by basis points to 
this improvement was reflective of a merchandising strategy which placed greater emphasis on the company s higher margin core categories  including parts and accessories and private label goods 
growth in the sale of extended warranty contracts and improved control over inventories were also factors that contributed to this improvement 
gross profit in fiscal year was  higher than in fiscal  primarily due to an increase in sales and an improvement in the gross margin percentage  which increased by percentage points to of sales 
this increase resulted primarily from the implementation of the new merchandising strategy described above 
selling  general and administrative expenses in us dollars  selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreased during fiscal year by  or 
this reduction  together with a sales increase of  combined to produce a reduction in the sg a percentage of percentage points  with reductions being experienced in all three countries 
the following chart illustrates sg a expense as a percentage of sales by geographic area sg a expense by geographic area as a percentage of sales canada australia united kingdom consolidated the following table provides a breakdown of sg a expense by major category in thousands sg a expense by category dollars of sales dollars of sales dollars of sales payroll    advertising    rent    taxes other than income taxes    telephone and utilities    other    foreign exchange rate effects more than explained the apparent reduction in sg a spending during fiscal year measured at the same exchange rates  sg a expenses increased by approximately 
spending increased in canada and australia  primarily on sales driven expenditures such as payroll 
increases in the overall store count in both countries and the completion of the roll out of the cantel program in canada also accounted for increases in rent 
the scheduled increase in the royalty payable to tandy as well as higher sales contributed to an overall increase in royalty expense of over  with increases being experienced in all three countries 
this royalty will increase from of sales to of sales effective july  had this rate been effective during fiscal year  sg a expense would have been approximately  higher than reported 
the impact of these increases in consolidated sg a expense was partially offset by a reduction in sg a spending in the united kingdom 
savings from the store closure program and a planned reduction in advertising expense accounted for a significant portion of the reduced sg a expense in the united kingdom 
the effects of the store closure program on sg a expense comparisons in the united kingdom will continue to be felt until the stores have been closed for a full months 
during fiscal year  sg a expense increased by  foreign exchange rate effects and the scheduled increase in the tandy royalty explained about one half of this increase 
sales growth in australia  the roll out of the cantel program in canada and advertising to increase brand awareness in australia and the united kingdom also contributed to higher costs 
in fiscal year  sg a expense increased  primarily as a result of implementing a strategy to grow the business by refocusing the company in its niche market  introducing new service and other initiatives and expanding in selected markets 
the increase in the number of stores resulted in higher rent and increased store payroll costs 
payroll costs also increased as a result of the strengthening of the management teams in all three countries 
management information systems were also improved  particularly in the united kingdom 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization decreased by  during fiscal year  falling from  to  this reduction primarily results from lower depreciation charges in the united kingdom following an asset impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year to write down the store assets in that country to their estimated fair value 
see impairment of long lived assets 
depreciation expense is likely to increase in the united kingdom in each of the next two fiscal years as a consequence  among other things  of ongoing store renovations 
depreciation expense in canada and australia is not expected to change by a material amount over the same period 
depreciation and amortization increased by  in fiscal year this increase was attributable to an increase in the level of capital spending  primarily on new stores  store renovations and enhanced management information systems 
in fiscal year  depreciation and amortization expense increased by  primarily as a result of increased capital spending on store renovations  new stores and investments in management information systems 
impairment of long lived assets because of the continued and higher than expected operating losses in the united kingdom in fiscal year  the company conducted an impairment evaluation of its fixed assets in the united kingdom 
as a result of this evaluation  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company recognized a non cash impairment charge of  which represents the difference between the estimated market value and the book value of the company s investment in property and equipment in the united kingdom  primarily in its retail store locations  including lease premiums  leasehold improvements and store fittings and fixtures 
estimated fair market value was principally determined based upon estimated future discounted cash flows 
foreign currency transaction gains losses foreign currency transaction gains of   and  arose during fiscal years  and  respectively 
these gains resulted from a variety of factors  including the effect of fluctuating foreign currency values on certain inter company debt and trade payables denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the debtor 
the company s major exposures to foreign currency risks were the canadian dollar denominated subordinated convertible debentures the debentures carried on the books of the company and the us dollar denominated note due to tandy which had been recorded in the canadian subsidiary 
historically  these two debts provided a natural hedge  as the related foreign currency risks were largely offsetting 
upon the repayment of the note due to tandy in december   the debentures were designated as a hedge against the company s net investment in its canadian subsidiary 
future foreign exchange gains and losses on the debentures will be included in other comprehensive income 
net interest expense interest expense  net of interest income  was   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the reduction in net interest expense in fiscal year results from the effects of the repayment of the note payable to tandy the secured loan agreement in december  and the benefits of the company s new revolving credit facility 
see liquidity and capital resources 
management also expects these benefits to be evident in the comparison with the prior year during the first two quarters of fiscal year in fiscal  the effect of scheduled principal repayments to tandy was partially offset by an increase in short term borrowings in the united kingdom 
principal repayments to tandy  as well as the voluntary conversion of a portion of the debentures by the holders thereof  contributed to lower net interest expense in fiscal year compared to fiscal income taxes the company s unusually high effective tax rate is primarily due to the fact that the company recognizes income tax expense on the profits generated by intertan canada and intertan australia  but does not recognize income tax benefits on the losses incurred by intertan uk limited 
the company expects its tax rate to continue to be unusually high until the united kingdom operation becomes profitable 
the provision for taxes in fiscal year of  primarily represents a provision for canadian federal and provincial and australian taxes on the profits of the company earned in those countries 
the provision for taxes in fiscal years and of  and  respectively  primarily represents a provision for canadian federal and provincial taxes on the profits of the canadian subsidiary 
at june   the company had deferred tax assets aggregating  against which a valuation allowance has been recorded in the amount of  primarily relating to loss carryforwards and other timing differences in the united states and the united kingdom 
the potential for future realization of the deferred tax assets will be reviewed on a regular basis 
an audit of the canadian income tax returns of the canadian subsidiary for the to taxation years was completed during fiscal year  resulting in additional tax being levied against the canadian subsidiary 
the company has appealed these reassessments and  pending the outcome of these matters  the company  by canadian law  was required to pay one half of the tax in dispute 
the tax levied by revenue canada in reassessing those years was offset by refunds arising from the carryback of losses incurred in subsequent years 
depending on the ultimate resolution of these issues  the company could potentially have an additional liability in the range of to  the company believes it has meritorious arguments in defense of the issues raised by revenue canada and it is in the process of vigorously defending its position 
it is management s determination that no additional provision need be recorded for these reassessments 
in order for the company to succeed in appealing certain aspects of these reassessments  it must succeed in defending the possible reassessments discussed in the paragraph immediately below 
the company was advised in august  that revenue canada intended to extend the scope of its to reassessments to raise certain issues flowing from the spin off of the company from tandy in fiscal year management disagrees with revenue canada s views on these issues and will vigorously defend the company s position should revenue canada pursue these issues 
management believes it has meritorious arguments supporting its stance and  accordingly  no additional provision has been recorded for these possible reassessments 
depending on the ultimate resolution of these issues  the company could potentially have an additional liability in the range of to  as required by canadian law  the company would likely be required to post a deposit of one half of the tax in dispute  including interest  in order to appeal any reassessment 
an audit of the canadian income tax returns of the canadian subsidiary for the to taxation years was commenced during the fiscal year 
the company has been advised that revenue canada is challenging certain interest deductions relating to the canadian subsidiary s former operations in continental europe and is proposing to tax certain foreign exchange gains related to such operations 
depending on the ultimate resolution of these issues  the company could potentially have an additional liability in the range of to  assuming revenue canada pursues these issues  in order for the company to proceed with such appeals  the company would likely be required to post a cash deposit or letters of credit equal to one half of the tax in dispute  together with interest 
notwithstanding that the company is still in discussions with revenue canada regarding these issues  revenue canada and certain provincial jurisdictions were required to issue protective reassessments for one of the years because the time period during which such reassessment could legally be issued was about to expire 
the amount of the reassessment  including interest  is approximately  this amount relates to the taxation year only and is reflected in the range described immediately above 
the company has appealed this reassessment and  as indicated above  would normally be required to post a cash deposit equal to one half of the reassessment  pending the outcome of such appeal 
however  revenue canada has agreed to defer the posting of such deposit pending the outcome of ongoing discussions on this particular issue 
revenue canada has further agreed to accept a letter of credit in lieu of a cash deposit should it be necessary for the company to actively proceed with its appeal 
the company has requested a similar deferral from the provincial authorities and reasonably expects that such deferral will be approved 
the company believes that reassessment of the remaining years under review could be received during fiscal year management believes it has meritorious arguments in support of the deductibility of such interest and in support of its treatment of the foreign exchange gains and is prepared to vigorously defend its position should the canadian tax authorities proceed with such a challenge 
accordingly  it is management s assessment that no provision need be recorded for these possible claims 
net income per average common share effective december   the company adopted financial accounting standards no 
 earnings per share fas  which establishes new standards for computing and presenting earnings per share eps 
fas requires dual presentation of basic and diluted eps on the face of the income statement for companies with complex capital structures 
basic eps is calculated by dividing the net income or loss for a period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period 
diluted eps reflects the potential dilution which would occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted 
fas also requires that eps for prior periods be recomputed using the new rules 
for fiscal years  and  basic and diluted losses per common share were  and  respectively  as the effects of the company s potentially dilutive instruments were anti dilutive in all three years 
the company s potentially dilutive instruments include the debentures 
under their terms of issuance  the debentures are convertible into common stock at the rate of shares for each cdn  face amount of debentures held  equivalent to about  shares in the aggregate 
however  if the company were to redeem the debentures after february  by issuing common shares to the holders thereof in accordance with the terms of the debentures  the dilutive effect of the debentures would be increased if the fair value of the company s common stock at the time of redemption were less than the conversion price 
based on the fair market value of the company s common stock on june   and  this would have resulted in the issuance of   and  shares  respectively on assumed conversion on those dates 
fas requires that these higher amounts be used in calculating diluted eps 
had conversion taken place  the net loss for fiscal years  and would have been reduced by   and  respectively  for assumed net reduction in expenses 
also  in fiscal years  and  the company s directors and employees held options to purchase   and  common shares  respectively  at prices ranging from to  to and to  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities generated  in cash during fiscal year net income  adjusted to reconcile net income to cash  produced  in cash 
a reduction in inventory levels contributed a further  in cash 
in canada  inventory reductions resulted from better management of the level of computer inventories and monitoring of the flow of merchandise through the product cycle 
in the united kingdom  the store closure program was a factor in reduced inventory levels 
the company increased inventories in australia to support higher sales 
the deferral of income tax installments conserved a further  in cash during fiscal year during fiscal year  operating activities generated  in cash 
net income  adjusted to reconcile net income to cash  generated  in cash  which was partially offset by  in cash consumed in building inventories 
the increase in inventories in fiscal was due primarily to the requirements of the newly opened cantel stores in canada and the need to build inventories in response to higher sales in australia 
operating activities generated  in cash during fiscal year net income  adjusted to reconcile net income to cash  generated  in cash  while increases in inventories consumed  in cash during that year 
the increase in the company s inventory levels in fiscal year resulted from implementing a merchandising strategy which places greater emphasis on higher margin private label goods  an improvement in the company s in stock position and a wider product assortment 
investing activities consumed  in cash during fiscal year compared with  and  in cash in fiscal years and  respectively 
these cash outflows result for the most part from additions to property and equipment  primarily relating to opening new stores  renovating existing stores and upgrading information systems 
these capital expenditures were higher in fiscal year  primarily because of the large number of new stores opened in that period 
during fiscal year  the company opened new stores  while in fiscal years and  and new stores  respectively  were opened 
during fiscal year  financing activities consumed  in cash 
repayment in full of the secured loan agreement with tandy comprised the major component of the cash outflow 
a decrease in the level of short term borrowings in the united kingdom was also a contributing factor 
the effect of these reductions in cash resources was partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of common stock to employee plans 
in fiscal year  financing activities generated  in cash 
the effects of an increase in short term borrowings in the united kingdom combined with proceeds from the issuance of stock to employee plans were partially offset by scheduled repayments on a note payable under the company s secured loan agreement with tandy 
in fiscal year  financing activities consumed  in cash 
in that year  the amount of cash consumed by scheduled repayments on one of the notes payable to tandy was augmented by the effect of the early retirement of another note payable to tandy 
the effect on cash of these repayments was partially offset by short term borrowings and cash generated from the sale of stock to employee plans 
the company s principal sources of liquidity during fiscal year will be its cash and short term investments  its cash flow from operations and its banking facilities 
in may   intertan canada ltd  intertan  inc and intertan uk limited entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks 
this agreement established a revolving facility in an amount which was determined using an inventory level calculation not to exceed cdn   at june  exchange rates 
in december   this credit agreement was replaced with a three year revolving facility with a syndicate of three new lenders the syndicated loan agreement in an amount not to exceed  in the aggregate 
the amount of credit actually available at any particular time is dependent on a variety of factors  including the level of eligible inventories and accounts receivable of intertan canada and intertan uk limited the borrowers 
the amount of available credit is then reduced by the amount of trade accounts payable of the borrowers then outstanding as well as certain other reserves 
the syndicated loan agreement and the previous credit facility are used primarily to provide letters of credit in support of purchase orders and  from time to time  to finance inventory purchases 
at june   there were borrowings against the syndicated loan agreement aggregating  and  was committed in support of letters of credit 
there was  of credit available for use at june  in september  the company s merchandise agreement with tandy was amended to permit the company to support purchase orders with a surety bond or bonds as well as letters of credit 
the company has entered into an agreement with a major insurer to provide surety bond coverage the bond in an amount not to exceed  use of the bond will give the company greater flexibility in placing orders with far eastern suppliers by releasing a portion of the credit available under the syndicated loan agreement for other purposes 
in fiscal year  the company s australian subsidiaries  intertan australia ltd 
and technotron sales corp 
pty  ltd  entered into a credit agreement with an australian bank the australian facility 
this agreement established a credit facility in the amount of a   at june  exchange rates 
the australian facility has no fixed term and may be terminated at any time upon five days prior written notice by the lender 
all or any part of the facility may be used to provide letters of credit in support of purchase orders 
a maximum amount of a   at june  exchange rates may be used in support of short term borrowings 
at june   there were no borrowings outstanding against the australian facility  a   at june  exchange rates was committed in support of letters of credit as described above and  of credit was available for use 
in addition to the credit facilities described above  the company s principal sources of outside financing have been from the borrowings from tandy under the secured loan agreement and from the debentures 
in order to obtain a release of its security interests so that security could be given under the syndicated loan agreement  all amounts payable to tandy under the secured loan agreement were repaid in full in december  for the sole consideration of the early repayment of this loan  warrants to purchase  shares of the common stock of the company held by tandy were surrendered for cancellation 
the company s primary uses of liquidity during fiscal year will include the building of inventories for the christmas selling season  the funding of capital expenditures  the servicing of debt and  possibly  the payment of tax deposits 
the company anticipates that capital additions will approximate  during fiscal year  mainly related to store expansion  remodeling and upgrading 
the company s debt servicing requirements in fiscal year are estimated to be approximately  and include interest payments on the debentures and under the syndicated loan agreement 
in addition  management expects to receive additional reassessments during fiscal year relating to its dispute with revenue canada in respect of the taxation years 
the company plans to appeal such reassessments  however  in order to do so it will be required to post a cash deposit or letters or credit in an amount equal to one half of the amount reassessed 
while the exact amount of such deposits will not be known until discussions with revenue canada  the company and its advisors have been concluded  management anticipates that the deposit required will be approximately  to  management believes that the company s cash and short term investments on hand and its cash flow from operations combined with the syndicated loan agreement  the australian facility and the bond will provide the company with sufficient liquidity to meet its planned requirements through fiscal year  including any tax deposits pursuant to the possible reassessments relating to the taxation years 
the company has additional tax issues in dispute with revenue canada 
see income taxes 
if reassessments are issued relating to these issues in amounts at the upper end of the ranges described under income taxes  the company would be required to seek additional sources of liquidity 
management is currently in the process of studying additional funding alternatives 
however  there can be no assurance that additional funding would be available  if required  on terms acceptable to the company 
year issues management recognizes that many of the company s information systems and related hardware were designed and developed without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century year and that a significant number of intertan s computer applications  systems and hardware will require modification or replacement to make them year compliant 
the company s critical systems include the following 
its store operating systems  
its so called back end merchandising and inventory systems  including purchasing  receiving and warehousing  perpetual inventories and store replenishment  and  
its primary accounting systems  including general ledger  accounts receivable  accounts payable and payroll 
the company s information systems include both internally developed systems and systems purchased from third party vendors 
in canada  with the exception of the primary accounting system  the company employs primarily internally developed systems 
in australia  the company has gradually shifted from internally developed systems to third party systems 
the primary accounting system and the warehouse distribution system are the only significant internally developed systems remaining in australia 
in the united kingdom a comprehensive  integrated suite of systems purchased from a third party has replaced virtually all internally developed systems 
the company is employing a variety of internal and external resources to assess and make changes necessitated by year issues to its many different systems and equipment 
many of these changes were contemplated in any event as upgrades or replacement of outdated systems and hardware 
the company has determined that its mainframe hardware is year compliant in all three countries 
in canada  during fiscal years and  point of sale hardware was replaced with equipment that is year compliant 
the store operating system was replaced in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year year related upgrades to back end inventory systems are in various stages of development  with completion targeted for later in calendar year the company s third party sourced accounting and payroll systems in canada have been certified as being year compliant and are currently in testing 
in australia  the store hardware and operating systems were replaced with systems that are year compliant during the fourth quarter of fiscal year the company is currently evaluating various options to replace the existing back end inventory and accounting systems 
it is anticipated that new systems will be in place by the end of fiscal year in the united kingdom  the current store hardware and operating systems are in the process of being replaced  with completion targeted to be in advance of the christmas selling season 
the company plans to migrate to a version of its integrated back end inventory and accounting systems which is year compliant by the end of the third quarter fiscal year the payroll system used in the united kingdom will be replaced prior to the end of calendar year management is still in the process of identifying and quantifying costs incurred to date as well as future anticipated costs associated with the year issue 
the company s current projection is that these costs will not exceed  in the most reasonably likely worst case scenario  the company s store operating and back end inventory management systems could fail 
the consequence of such failure could include the inability to record sales transactions in the company s stores and a breakdown in the supply chain 
such an occurrence would likely result in a loss of revenue  it is not possible to quantify the possible range of such loss 
this would necessitate reverting to a number of manual systems for recording sales  ordering product and replenishing the company s stores 
management does not currently have a formal documented contingency plan to deal with this scenario 
management anticipates that such a contingency plan will be in place by june  the company has communicated with its suppliers and other organizations with which it does business to coordinate year issues and to ensure the continuity of supply of product and services 
in a most reasonably likely worst case scenario  one or more significant suppliers could be unable to continue to adequately supply the company after the company s fallback position would be to seek an alternative source of supply 
however  there can be no assurance that such alternative sources of supply would be available 
the company does not yet have a list of alternative suppliers should some suppliers be unable to continue to provide product or services beyond the end of calendar year such a contingency plan will be in place by the end of fiscal year it is not practical for management to estimate the range of financial loss  if any  which could result from the negative effect that a disruption in supply would have on the company s business 
the company is currently in the process of assessing its obligations  if any  arising from the sale of warranted product which proves not to be year compliant in one or more aspects 
it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the range of loss  if any  which could arise from such obligation 
management is closely monitoring the company s advancements towards year conversion and progress reports are presented regularly to the company s board of directors 
although there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete all of the modifications in the required time frame  or that the company will be able to identify all year issues before problems manifest themselves  in management s opinion  the company is taking adequate action to address year issues and does not expect the financial impact of being year compliant to be material to the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of market risks arising primarily from the impact of changes in interest rates on its short term credit facilities and from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations as they relate to its investment  debt and activities in canada  australia and the united kingdom 
foreign currency fluctuations with the exception of the corporate offices  the company s activities are carried on in foreign jurisdictions canada  australia and the united kingdom 
the company is exposed to foreign currency risks in three broad areas 
its inventory purchases  
translation of its financial results  and 
its net investment in foreign jurisdictions 
inventory purchases the company s operating entities purchase approximately of their inventories in the far east 
these purchases are made in us dollars and  under the terms of its agreement with its suppliers  payment must be made at the time of shipment 
these orders often require long lead times 
accordingly  there is risk that the value of the canadian and australian dollars and the united kingdom pound sterling  as the case may be  could fluctuate relative to the us dollar from the time the goods are ordered until shipment is made 
management monitors the foreign exchange risk associated with its us dollar open orders on a regular basis by reviewing the amount of such open orders  exchange rates  including forecasts from major financial institutions  local news and other economic factors  all on a country specific basis 
based on this input  management decides whether or not to lock in the cost of a portion of those orders in advance of delivery by purchasing forward exchange rate contracts to be settled on or near the estimated date of inventory delivery 
the table below shows the amount of open orders and forward exchange contracts on hand at june  and the financial impact which would result if the functional currency of the purchasing entities were to decline in value by relative to the us dollar from june  to the date of delivery open orders at june   impact of a decline in local currency values  foreign exchange contracts on hand at june   impact of a decline in local currency values net impact of a decline in local currency values  the incremental cost of such a decline in currency values  if incurred  would be reflected in higher cost of sales in future periods 
in these circumstances  management would take product pricing action  where appropriate 
translation of financial results the functional currencies of the company s operating entities in canada  australia and the united kingdom are the respective local currencies 
however  the reporting currency of the company on a consolidated basis is the us dollar 
consequently  fluctuations in the value of the canadian and australian dollars and the pound sterling have a direct effect on reported consolidated results 
it is not possible for management to effectively hedge against the possible impact of this risk 
the following table shows the consolidated sales and operating income loss for fiscal year and the effect that a decline in local currency values would have had on those results 
effect of a decline in currency us dollars  in thousands as reported values sales canada   australia   united kingdom   operating income loss canada   australia  united kingdom   corporate expenses  net investment in foreign jurisdictions the company s net investments in canada  australia and the united kingdom are recorded in us dollars at the respective period end rates 
changes in these rates will have a direct effect on the carrying value of these investments 
the cummulative effect of such currency fluctuations is recorded in a separate account in equity 
the company s convertible subordinated debenture is denominated in us dollars and is recorded in the books of the parent 
this instrument is designated as a partial hedge against the risk associated with the company s investment in its canadian subsidiary 
the company has not  to date  attempted to hedge its investment in australia and the united kingdom 
the following table shows the company s net investment in each of its operating entities and its canadian dollar denominated convertible debenture  all expressed in us dollars at june  the table also shows the effect on those amounts if each local currency were to lose of its value against the us dollar effect of a decline in currency us dollars  in thousands june  values net investment in canada   canadian dollar denominated debenture   net investment in australia   net investment in united kingdom   short term interest rates the company s credit facilities include syndicated banking facilities in canada and the united kingdom  and a separate facility in australia 
these banking arrangements  which are used primarily to finance inventory purchases  provide for interest on any short term borrowings at rates determined with reference to the local prime or base rates 
these rates are  therefore  subject to change for a variety of reasons which are beyond the company s control 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the company s borrowings under these facilities  primarily in the united kingdom  averaged approximately  during fiscal year and interest paid on such advances was approximately  for the period july to december   interest on these uk borrowings was payable at the uk base rate plus 
for the period january to june   interest was completed at the london inter bank offered rate libor plus 
had the uk base rate and libor rate been higher in each of the respective periods  management estimates that interest expense for the year would have increased by approximately  it has not been the company s policy to hedge against the risk presented by possible fluctuations in short term interest rates
