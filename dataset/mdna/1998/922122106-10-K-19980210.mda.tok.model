operating environment overview and pro forma discussion the company s results depend  in large part  on the level of worldwide oil and gas drilling and production activity  the price of oil and gas  and worldwide oil and gas inventory levels 
key industry indicators for the past three years include the following rig activity us canada international worldwide    us workover rig us    west texas intermediate crude per barrel natural gas prices mtbu per mbtu averages for the years indicated 
the source for rig activity information was baker hughes incorporated bhi  and the source for oil and gas prices was spears and associates 
worldwide drilling and us workover activity improved during us  canada  and international rig activity in increased   and over levels  while us workover activity in was up from levels 
the price for west texas intermediate crude declined in compared to  and natural gas prices were down slightly from levels 
the overall improvement in market conditions created strong demand for the company s products and services which  together with the and initiatives discussed above  resulted in improved operating results as shown in the company s following actual and pro forma giving effect to all and acquisitions financial statements in thousands  except per share amounts pro pro forma actual forma actual actual revenue      net income before write off of assets  merger costs  and extraordinary charges      net income loss      dilutive earnings per share before write off of assets  merger costs  and extraordinary charges dilutive earnings loss per share pro forma information is unaudited and is presented as if the and acquisitions were made as of january  such information should not be considered indicative of actual results that would have been achieved if the and acquisitions had been consummated on january the million increase in pro forma revenue for over was due to several factors including improved overall market conditions as discussed above  significant growth in latin american revenue and in revenue from solids control and pipeline operations  greater revenue from the company s coiled tubing pressure control products  and an increase in worldwide coating sales 
the pro forma net income of million was million higher than the comparable amount in of million before write off of assets  merger costs  and extraordinary item 
this increase was due to revenue growth from greater activity levels as discussed in the results of operations 
subsequent to december   the average price of oil and gas has declined 
this change in price has been caused by various concerns  including rising reported world oil inventories  the financial crisis in asia  an increase in official production quotas  concerns that increased iraq production might soon reenter the world market  and temperate weather conditions 
although oil prices have declined  the us rig count as reported by bhi at january  was  up over the average rig count for at the date of this report  the company was not aware of any material spending cut backs of its major customers  although lower oil prices for a prolonged period could result in some spending reductions  which could have a material adverse affect on the company 
during the company generated approximately million  or  of its total revenue from singapore  malaysia  indonesia  thailand  vietnam  australia  japan  and korea 
most of the company s customers in these countries are large  multinational oil companies with limited direct exposure to the current economic climate in southeast asia  and a significant portion of the company s contracts are denominated in us dollars 
management does not believe that the economic downturn in southeast asia will have a material direct adverse impact on the business of the company  except to the extent that reduced hybrocarbon demand in the area may contribute to lower oil and gas prices and reduced oil and gas activity worldwide

factors affecting future operating results this annual report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of the forward looking statements are those that do not state historical facts and are inherently subject to risk and uncertainties 
the forward looking statements contained herein are based on current expectations and entail various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
such risks and uncertainties are set forth below 
the oil and gas industry in which the company participates historically has experienced significant volatility 
demand for the company s services and products depends primarily upon the number of oil and gas wells being drilled  the depth and drilling conditions of such wells  the volume of production  the number of well completions and the level of workover activity 
drilling and workover activity can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time  particularly in the united states and canada 
the willingness of oil and gas operators to make capital expenditures for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas will continue to be influenced by numerous factors over which the company has no control  including the prevailing and expected market prices for oil and natural gas 
such prices are impacted by  among other factors  the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to maintain price stability through voluntary production limits  the level of production of non opec countries  worldwide demand for oil and gas  general economic and political conditions  costs of exploration and production  availability of new leases and concessions  and governmental regulations regarding  among other things  environmental protection  taxation  price controls and product allocations 
no assurance can be given as to the level of future oil and gas industry activity or demand for the company s services and products 
the company s foreign operations  which include significant operations in canada  europe  the far east  the middle east and latin america  are subject to the risks normally associated with conducting business in foreign countries  including uncertain political and economic environments  which may limit or disrupt markets  restrict the movement of funds or result in the deprivation of contract rights or the taking of property without fair compensation 
government owned petroleum companies located in some of the countries in which the company operates have adopted policies or are subject to governmental policies giving preference to the purchase of goods and services from companies that are majority owned by local nationals 
as a result of such policies  the company relies on joint ventures  license arrangements and other business combinations with local nationals in these countries 
in addition  political considerations may disrupt the commercial relationship between the company and such government owned petroleum companies 
although the company has not experienced any significant problems in foreign countries arising from nationalistic policies  political instability  economic instability or currency restrictions  there can be no assurance that such a problem will not arise in the future 
the company s inspection and coating services routinely involve the handling of waste materials  some of which may be considered to be hazardous wastes 
the company is subject to numerous local  state and federal laws and regulations concerning the containment and disposal of hazardous materials  pursuant to which the company has been required to incur compliance and clean up costs 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations due to currently unknown circumstances or developments  however  could result in substantial costs and have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
a significant portion of the company s recent growth in revenues and profitability has been the result of its aggressive acquisition program 
the company s future operating results will be impacted by the company s ability to identify additional attractive acquisition opportunities  consummate such acquisitions on favorable terms and successfully integrate the operations of the acquired businesses with those of the company 
year the company has conducted a comprehensive review of its computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the year issue and is implementing its plan to resolve the issue 
the year problem is a result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a major system failure or miscalculations 
the company presently believes that  with modifications to existing software and converting to new software  the year problem will not pose significant operational problems for the company s computer systems as so modified and converted 
pending accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas no 
which establishes standards for the way that public companies report information about operating segments in both annual and interim financial statements 
sfas no 
also establishes standards for disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company will adopt sfas no 
retroactively in the adoption of sfas no 
will not affect the company s results of operations or financial position  but will increase the company s disclosure of segment information 
in june  the fasb also issued sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income which establishes new rules for the reporting and display of comprehensive income 
adoption of sfas no 
will have no impact on the company s net income or financial position 
sfas no 
would require the company s foreign currency translation adjustments  which are currently reported in stockholders equity  to be added to net income to determine total comprehensive income 
disclosure of total comprehensive income is also required
