funds from operations management believes that to facilitate a clear understanding of the company s operating results  funds from operations ffo should be considered in conjunction with net income loss presented in accordance with gaap 
in march  the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit established guidelines clarifying the definition of ffo 
ffo is defined as net income loss determined in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the company generally considers ffo an appropriate measure of liquidity of an equity reit because industry analysts have accepted it as a performance measure of equity reits 
the company s ffo is not comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term using the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than does the company 
therefore  the company cautions that the calculation of ffo may vary from entity to entity and as such the presentation of ffo by the company may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other reporting companies 
the company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of its operating results  ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income determined in accordance with gaap 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of the company s performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions
