as of september  the outstanding balance of such indebtedness was million on the subordinated notes granted by investors na 
on april   the senior loan granted by a group of banks was completely paid off 
the principal source of liquidity for fic s subsidiaries consists of the periodic payment of principal and interest by family life pursuant to the terms of a surplus debenture 
the terms of the surplus debenture were previously approved by the washington insurance commissioner 
under the provisions of the surplus debenture and current law  no prior approval of the washington insurance department is required for family life to pay interest or principal on the surplus debenture  provided that  after giving effect to such payments  the statutory surplus of family life is in excess of of assets the surplus floor 
however  family life has voluntarily agreed with the washington insurance commissioner that it will provide at least five days advance notice of payments which it will make under the surplus debenture 
as of december   the statutory capital and surplus of family life was million  an amount substantially in excess of the surplus floor 
during  family life made principal payments of million and interest payments of million to family life corporation under the surplus debenture 
as of december   the principal balance of the surplus debenture was million 
the funds required by family life to meet its obligations under the terms of the surplus debenture are generated primarily from premium payments from policyholders  investment income and the proceeds from the sale and redemption of portfolio investments 
washington s insurance code includes the greater of standard for dividends but has requirements that prior notification of a proposed dividend be given to the washington insurance commissioner and that cash dividends may be paid only from earned surplus 
family life does not presently have earned surplus as defined by the regulations adopted by the washington insurance commissioner and  therefore  is not permitted to pay cash dividends 
however  since the new law applies only to dividend payments  the ability of family life to make principal and interest payments under the surplus debenture is not affected 
the company does not anticipate that family life will have any difficulty in making principal and interest payments on the surplus debenture in the amounts necessary to enable family life corporation to service its indebtedness for the foreseeable future 
the sources of funds for family life consist of premium payments from policy holders  investment income and the proceeds from the sale and redemption of portfolio investments 
these funds are applied primarily to provide for the payment of claims under insurance and annuity policies  operating expenses  taxes  investments in portfolio securities  shareholder dividends and payments under the provisions of the surplus debenture 
fic s net cash flow provided by operating activities was million in  as compared to million in and million in net cash flow used in financing activities was million in  as compared to million in and million in in connection with the purchase of the investors life companies by ilco and the purchase of family life by a wholly owned subsidiary of fic  fic guaranteed the payment of the indebtedness created in connection with such acquisitions 
the guaranty commitments of fic with respect to the debt obligations of ilco relate to the ilco senior loan  with an outstanding balance at december  of million 
the guaranty commitments of fic under the loans incurred in connection with the acquisition of family life after taking into account the repayments and new loans which occurred in july  relate to i the million note issued by family life corporation to investors life insurance company of north america  and ii the million loaned by investors na to two subsidiaries of fic 
management believes that its cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are sufficient to meet the needs of its business and to satisfy debt service 
investments as of december   the company s investment assets totaled million  as compared to million as of december  the level of short term investments at the end of was million  as compared to million as of december  the fixed maturities available for sale portion represents million of investment assets as of december   as compared to million at the end of the amortized cost of fixed maturities available for sale as of december  was million representing a net unrealized gain of million 
this unrealized gain principally reflects changes in interest rates from the date the respective investments were purchased 
to reduce the exposure to interest rate changes  portfolio investments are selected so that diversity  maturity and liquidity factors approximate the duration of associated policyholder liabilities 
the assets held by family life must comply with applicable state insurance laws and regulations 
in selecting investments for the portfolios of its life insurance subsidiaries  the company s emphasis is to obtain targeted profit margins  while minimizing the exposure to changing interest rates 
this objective is implemented by selecting primarily short to medium term  investment grade fixed income securities 
in making such portfolio selections  the company generally does not select new investments which are commonly referred to as high yield or non investment grade 
the fixed maturities portfolio of family life  as of december   consisted solely of fixed maturities investments which  in the annual statements of the companies  as filed with state insurance departments  were designated under the national association of insurance commissioners naic rating system as a highest quality 
management believes that the absence of high yield or non investment grade investments as defined above in the portfolios of its life insurance subsidiary enhances the ability of the company to service its debt  provide security to its policyholders and to credit relatively consistent rates of return to its policyholders 
yk compliance the company and its subsidiaries utilize a centralized computer system to process policyholder records and financial information 
in addition  the company uses non centralized computer terminals in connection with its operations 
the software programs used in connection with these systems will be affected by what is referred to as the yk date problem 
this refers to the limitations of the programming code in certain existing software programs to recognize date sensitive information as the year approaches 
unless modified prior to the year  such systems may not properly recognize such information and could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail to operate properly 
the company has evaluated its centralized computer systems and has developed a plan to reach yk compliance 
a central feature of the plan is to convert most of the centralized systems to a common system which is already in compliance with yk requirements 
the company is in the process of this systems conversion and anticipates that the project will be completed in advance of the year the plan calls for an upgrade of the family life s administrative systems by changing individual lines of computer code in order to modify current operating software such that it will become yk compliant 
the administrative systems which are not modified will be converted onto the company s ck system  a system designed to be yk compliant according to the representations of the vendor 
under the plan  the company will utilize the services of personnel of its affiliate  fic computer services  inc  to acquire yk compliant operating software  and engage the assistance of outside consultants to facilitate the systems conversions and modifications 
the company has budgeted approximately  for implementation of the plan 
in the event that the plan does not achieve full compliance by the target dates  or if unforeseen matters involving yk appear at later dates  the company will utilize the staff of fic computer services to identify and resolve such issues as and if they arise 
in order to continuously evaluate the effectiveness of the modifications and conversions made to the various systems  fic computer services has acquired testing software to simulate dates on or after january  additionally  fic computer services runs the systems through model office cycles and also conducts visual inspections of screen displays to determine whether the systems are functioning in a yk compliant manner 
a material number of policies administered by family life  will be modified rather than converted 
the modification of the pms system administering approximately  policies for family life was completed in march  the conversion of the cypros ap system administering approximately  policies for family life is scheduled for completion at the end of september  a non material number of family life policies are administered by systems which also administer policies for ilco and its subsidiaries 
with regard to ilco and its subsidiaries  the alis system administering approximately  policies for investors na was converted to ck in january of the conversion of the life system administering approximately  policies for investors in is scheduled for completion in april  the modification of the lifecomm b system which is responsible for the  policies assumed after the acquisition of state auto life is also scheduled for completion in april  the conversion of the lifecomm a system administering approximately  policies for investors na is now scheduled for completion in september of the various software applications described above are licensed to the company or its affiliates under agreements which permit the company s and ilco s subsidiaries to process business on its computer systems utilizing such software 
in  fic computer services purchased new mainframe hardware and accompanying operating software  which the vendor has represented to be yk compliant 
this hardware and software will be tested in the telephone system has been tested by the maintenance provider for that system and the company has received assurances that the telephone system is yk compliant 
with respect to non centralized systems ie desktop computers  the company anticipates that updated software releases will be commercially available well in advance of the year accordingly  to the extent that such systems rely on date sensitive information  the company expects that the effort needed to correct for yk problems will be less time intensive than the effort needed to achieve compliance for its centralized systems
