tampa electric electric operations tampa electric s operating results in  tampa electric benefited from a strong local economy  good customer growth and continued cost control 
its operating income increased more than percent  after the recognition of million of previously deferred revenues to support the inclusion of polk unit one in rate base for earnings purposes 
tampa electric s operating income increased more than six percent over results even after the deferral of million of revenues 
higher base revenues from retail customer growth  favorable weather and an improved economy together with lower operating expenses and the inclusion of polk unit one in rate base for earnings purposes in the fourth quarter contributed to the improvement 
tampa electric results change change millions revenues    operating expenses 
operating income tampa electric revenues include the recognition of million of previously deferred revenues 
and revenues are net of million and million of deferred revenues  respectively 
tampa electric s operating revenues tampa electric s operating revenues increased almost seven percent to billion  after the recognition of million of previously deferred revenues 
the company benefited from customer growth of more than two percent and retail energy sales growth  despite mild weather  of one percent 
tampa electric s revenues  even after the deferral of million of revenues  increased due to more than two percent customer growth and higher energy sales due to a colder than normal winter 
the economy in tampa electric s service area continued to grow in with increased employment from corporate relocations and expansions 
combined residential and commercial energy sales declined slightly in  as the effects of mild weather more than offset the addition of over  new customers 
non phosphate industrial sales increased in primarily due to the strong local economy and the shift of some commercial customers to the industrial classification to take advantage of new favorable florida tax law changes on electricity used in manufacturing 
sales to the phosphate industry increased in as production increased to meet continued strong domestic and international demand for phosphate products 
sales to the phosphate customer group represented less than four percent of base revenues in based on its own and independent forecasts  tampa electric expects its service area economy to grow moderately for the next several years at rates higher than the country as a whole 
the local economy continues to benefit from a good labor market  available land  good access through airport and port facilities and economic development activities by local communities 
based on this expected growth reflecting both population and business activity increases  tampa electric projects higher retail energy sales of more than two percent annually for each of the next five years  with combined energy sales growth in the residential and commercial sectors of almost three percent annually 
energy sales to non phosphate industrial customers are expected to grow almost two percent annually for the next five years 
after  sales to the phosphate industry are expected to decline slowly as mining activity migrates out of tampa electric s service area 
this decline could be accelerated if imc agrico imca or others decide to pursue new self generation projects 
see the utility regulation section 
imca is tampa electric s largest customer  representing less than three percent of base revenues 
all of these growth projections are based on important assumptions  including continued local area economic growth  normal weather and no significant regulatory changes 
non fuel revenues from sales to other utilities were million in  million in and million in non fuel revenues increased in and due to a shift from broker system economy sales to longer term  higher margin wholesale power sales 
megawatt hours sold to other utilities decreased in primarily due to lower tampa electric generating unit availability 
an adverse fpsc decision in which required tampa electric to change its regulatory treatment of two wholesale power sales contracts  had the effect of reducing tampa electric s earnings by about 
per share 
the required treatment eliminates certain assets from retail rate base and shifts certain costs from retail to wholesale where they are not fully recovered 
one of the contracts has been terminated and efforts are being made to mitigate the effects of the second 
the impact of the remaining contract and the mitigation effort is not expected to have a material impact on results 
as a result of the fpsc decision  tampa electric will concentrate its wholesale power sales efforts on energy broker and other short term sales through  and not on longer term capacity contracts as in the past 
tampa electric megawatt hour sales change change thousands residential    commercial    industrial    other    total retail    sales for resale    total energy sold    retail customers average results reflect the shift of some commercial customers to the industrial classification to take advantage of new favorable florida tax law changes on electricity used in manufacturing 
this does not affect tampa electric s revenues 
tampa electric s operating expenses non fuel operations and maintenance expenses rose almost six percent  reflecting a full year of operations of polk unit one and increased generating unit maintenance 
improved efficiency and the continued focus on aggressive cost management throughout the company limited other operations expense increases 
absent increased generating unit maintenance expense  operations and maintenance expense in all other areas increased less than one percent 
non fuel operations and maintenance expenses declined in due to the continuing focus on managing costs in all areas of the company 
over the next several years  non fuel operations and maintenance expense increases are expected to average about the same level as inflation 
in september  tampa electric completed the construction of the megawatt  state of the art  clean coal technology polk unit one 
the addition of this facility was the primary cause of increased non fuel operating expenses in during the first three years of operations a total of million from the u 
s 
department of energy doe is available to partially offset a significant portion of the non fuel operations and maintenance expenses 
the fpsc has allowed full recovery of the capital costs incurred in the construction of the plant as described in the utility regulation section 
operating expenses change change millions other operating expenses

depreciation expense increased million in due to normal plant additions to serve the growing customer base and a full year of service of polk unit one 
depreciation expense in increased from normal plant additions and the fourth quarter addition of polk unit one 
depreciation expense is projected to rise moderately for the next several years due to normal utility plant additions 
changes in taxes other than those on income reflected the property taxes associated with polk unit one in higher state gross receipts taxes and franchise fees associated with higher energy sales and changes in property values in were offset by decreases in payroll related taxes as a result of the restructuring 
total fuel cost increased by two percent in due to higher energy sales and a larger proportion of purchased power  a component of total fuel cost  as a result of lower generating unit availability 
in  total fuel cost was less than one percent higher than in despite a five percent increase in total energy sales 
the success in controlling fuel cost is a result of tampa electric s use of lower priced coals and the mix in operating generating units 
average coal costs  on a cents per million btu basis  declined more than two percent in after a six percent decrease in purchased power increased in due to lower generating unit availability 
in  purchased power increased primarily to meet weather related demand 
substantially all fuel and purchased power expenses were recovered through the fuel adjustment clause 
nearly all of tampa electric s generation in the last three years has been from coal  and the fuel mix is expected to continue to be substantially coal 
external forecasts indicate relatively stable coal prices for the next few years compared to oil or gas prices 
peoples gas system peoples gas system results in june  teco energy completed its merger with the parent company of the peoples gas companies 
concurrent with this merger  the largest subsidiary  peoples gas system pgs  a regulated local gas distribution company  was merged into tampa electric company and now operates as the peoples gas division of tampa electric company 
also in june  teco energy completed its acquisition of the west florida natural gas company west florida gas  a local distribution company serving the ocala and panama city  florida areas 
west florida gas was merged into tampa electric and now operates as part of the peoples gas division 
these acquisitions were accounted for as poolings of interests and  accordingly  the financial and operating data include the results of west florida gas and pgs  combined for the full year 
the financial statements prior to have been restated to include the results of the peoples gas companies 
the prior years have not been restated to reflect the operations and financial position of west florida gas due to its insignificant size 
these acquisitions further teco energy s strategy of pursuing growth in energy related businesses through geographic expansion and the addition of new product and service offerings

operating income therms sold millions residential commercial industrial transportation total customers thousands excludes the revenues and expenses for and of west florida gas 
excludes approximately  customers and million therms in and  customers and million therms in of west florida gas 
pgs is the largest natural gas distribution utility in florida with about percent of the market 
it serves almost  customers in the major metropolitan areas of florida  including jacksonville  daytona beach  orlando  fort lauderdale  miami  st 
petersburg  tampa  sarasota  ocala and panama city and the surrounding communities 
the operations of pgs are regulated by the fpsc  which has jurisdiction over rates  service  issuance of certain securities  safety  accounting practices and other matters 
the pgs customer base is largely residential and small commercial customers with a smaller number of large commercial and industrial customers and power generation facilities 
pgs has increased the number of commercial and residential customers served more than two percent annually over the last five years 
pgs is actively marketing natural gas service to major new home builders  targeting upscale communities where annual per customer usage approaches  therms per year compared to the current average of therms per customer per year 
in  residential customers represented percent of customers  used five percent of total gas and contributed percent of non fuel revenues 
in florida  natural gas has been used by commercial customers for food processing and production of products such as steel  glass and ceramic tile 
in addition  the use of natural gas for climate control is s p r eading to institutional  commercial and industrial customers including schools  hospitals and office complexes 
in  commercial customers represented percent of customers  used percent of total gas and contributed percent of non fuel revenues 
pgs is increasing its investment in infrastructure to serve residential and commercial customers 
it expects to invest to million annually for the next five years to grow the business  doubling the historical level of capital expenditures 
infrastructure will be expanded in areas already currently served and into areas not yet served by natural gas 
gas sales to large commercial and industrial customers have decreased as these customers shifted to increased use of transportation only services 
large industrial and power generation customers are permitted under current regulation to purchase natural gas directly from gas marketers  with pgs providing gas delivery at transportation only rates 
deliveries to these customers can vary significantly from year to year due to price and availability of gas compared to prices for other fuels that may be substituted for natural gas 
in  large industrial and transportation customers represented one percent of the customers  used percent of total gas transported and contributed percent of non fuel revenues 
transportation volumes increased in due to the addition of west florida gas and the conversion of some large commercial customers to transportation only service 
transportation gas volumes decreased significantly in due to a power generation customer decreasing gas usage and the scheduled removal from the system of a cogeneration customer 
residential gas sales increased in due to the additional volume from west florida gas  which was partially offset by a mild winter after high levels of gas sales in the winter was one of the coldest in florida history 
p g s s ales volumes and revenues are subject to seasonal fluctuations 
typically sales volumes are higher during the winter months reflecting greater demand for residential space heating  and revenues are higher reflecting both increased demand and higher demand driven natural gas prices 
changes in the cost of gas sold are reflected in customers bills through the fpsc approved purchased gas adjustment clause 
pgs is focused on cost control and held operating expenses flat in despite the addition of west florida gas 
additional operating expense savings are expected in as a result of merger related synergies  mainly from the elimination of duplicative overhead and administrative activities  as well as improved operating efficiencies and lower interest costs 
operating expenses increased in over due to the implementation of an incentive compensation program for employees and h i gher depreciation on normal additions to property  plant and equipment 
diversified companies diversified companies operating results the diversified companies achieved operating income of million in compared with million in and million in the diversified companies now include a propane company  an appliance sales and service company and a gas marketing company acquired with pgs 
the improved results in were due to higher coal volumes handled for tampa electric along with increased overseas grain business at teco transport  and teco coal s growth in third party sales and lower operating expenses 
higher operating income in resulted from higher gas prices throughout the year at teco coalbed methane and teco power services first full year of operations at the alborada power station in guatemala 
diversified companies results from continuing operations unconsolidated millions change change revenues operating expenses operating income a l l amounts have been restated to exclude the discontinued operations of teco oil gas 
certain amounts have been restated to conform to the current year presentation 
o p e rating income includes items which are reclassified for consolidated financial statement purposes 
the principal items are the non conventional fuels tax credit related to coalbed methane production and interest expense on the limited recourse debt related to independent power operations  both of which are included in operating income for the diversified companies 
in the consolidated statements of income the tax credit is part of the provision for income taxes and the interest is part of interest expense 
teco transport achieved higher operating income in the transfer terminal handled higher coal volumes for tampa electric to replenish coal inventories depleted in and all areas of the company achieved increased operating efficiencies 
the ocean going business also benefited from a full year of operations from the ship added in and increased grain charter business 
the river business was impacted by adverse weather conditions early in the year 
this was partially offset by increased northbound business and higher volumes handled for tampa electric 
results in improved due to added capacity on the river and in the ocean going fleet and increased northbound river traffic 
the ocean shipping business in late again increased its capacity  adding a second ship to the fleet 
this  ton ship will be used in the government sponsored export grain trade and will free other vessels for general business uses 
t h e transfer terminal handled slightly lower quantities of petroleum coke as excess capacity depressed market prices leading suppliers to hold the product off the market 
this decrease was more than offset by higher export coal volumes and increased tonnage of coal transferred for tampa electric 
teco transport expects to benefit from the continued strong domestic demand for phosphate products  and from further diversification into new markets and cargoes in transfers of petroleum coke are expected to increase in reflecting an increase in supply and a return to more normal demand 
increased transfers and northbound river shipments of steel related products are also expected as a result of new steel mini mills coming on line and the offering of an integrated package of services for scrap and other steel products 
significant factors which could affect overall results are weather  commodity grain prices and domestic and overseas economic conditions 
teco coal s operating income increased nine percent in due to increased shipments of specialty coals to third parties from the new facilities at clintwood elkhorn and the growth in third party steam coal sales which more than offset higher production costs at premier and lower shipments to tampa electric 
in  operating income was lower than in primarily due to a million pretax gain from a road condemnation settlement in sales increased to million tons in  compared to million tons in and million tons in success in burning more conventional and lower cost steam coals has enabled tampa electric to adopt a competitive strategy of phasing down coal shipments from teco coal for the last several years 
shipments to tampa electric declined by about percent in after a percent decline in because of this decrease and high production costs  gatliff closed several mines in shipments to tampa electric are expected to decline by approximately percent in i n september  teco coal acquired million tons of metallurgical grade coal reserves contiguous to its existing clintwood operations and constructed a new preparation plant at this location 
this facility  which supports an additional one million tons of annual production  went into service in mid metallurgical coal has unique characteristics and is sold primarily to the steel industry both domestically and internationally 
most of the production from the premier mines is committed through teco coal expects increased sales volumes from the premier mines and the clintwood expansion to offset the impact on operating results of lower sales to tampa electric in teco coalbed methane s operating income increased more than two percent as higher per unit section tax credits and lower per unit operating costs more than offsetting the anticipated three percent decline in production 
gas price strength in was a result of low inventory levels at the start of the fall heating season 
production declined to billion cubic feet bcf from bcf in at year end  proven reserves were estimated to be bcf 
results in improved due to strong gas prices 
production from teco coalbed methane s reserves are eligible for non conventional fuels tax credits under section of the internal revenue code through the year the credit  which grows with inflation  was estimated at per thousand cubic feet mcf in all gas produced is sold under contract at spot market prices for the life of the reserves 
although natural gas prices have been subject to significant volatility since late  the section tax credits provide some degree of stability to teco coalbed methane s operating results 
teco power services operating income decreased  as expected  in as a result of interest expense associated with the million limited recourse project debt financing completed in january for the alborada station in guatemala 
operating income rose in from a full year of operation of this megawatt station 
in  teco power services formed a partnership with the same guatemalan business interest it partnered with for the alborada power station and with coastal corporation to build  own and operate a megawatt pulverized coal fired power plant  the san jose power station in guatemala 
the partnership signed a year power supply agreement with the same guatemalan distribution utility that purchases power from the alborada plant 
all necessary construction permits are in hand  design and engineering work continues and construction has started 
the million san jose station is scheduled to be completed by early teco power services has a percent interest in the project 
teco power services domestic project  the hardee power station in west central florida  continues to operate reliably  supplying power to seminole electric cooperative and tampa electric 
peoples gas company pgc  the unregulated propane gas business acquired in the peoples gas companies merger  is the largest independent propane distributor in florida 
in  it had more than  customers and sold more than million gallons of liquid propane gas compared with  customers and million gallons sold in in  the effects of mild weather more than offset customer growth 
pgc does business in the same major metropolitan areas as pgs and in other areas as well  marketing liquid propane gas to residential  commercial and industrial customers 
propane competes directly with natural gas  electricity and fuel oil  and its marketing areas are not limited by a pipeline infrastructure 
pgc also serves as a strategic partner to pgs by installing propane systems to support early phases of development while holding the delivery of natural gas until there is sufficient demand to justify the extension of the pipeline infrastructure to serve customers 
pgc expects to grow customers and volumes in and beyond through increased marketing activity and acquisitions 
peoples sales and service  also acquired in the peoples gas companies merger  helps facilitate new growth and sales for pgs and pgc through the coordination of the retail sales installation and service of gas burning appliances for pgs and pgc customers 
teco gas services is another unregulated business acquired in the peoples gas companies merger 
this company provides gas management and marketing services for large industrial customers 
in teco gas services provided gas management for three cogeneration facilities 
tecom is marketing advanced energy management  automation and control systems for commercial and residential applications  called the interlane power manager and the interlane home manager respectively 
tecom made progress in in the development and marketing of these systems  particularly the one for commercial applications 
the system was installed in a number of commercial facilities in locations within  among others the nashville electric system  the nebraska public power district and omaha public power district  the idaho power system and the washington water power system 
in  the power manager is being offered to tampa electric s commercial and light industrial c u s t o mers as part of an energy information service package 
additionally  several utilities engaged in projects demonstrating the residential product in because of a continued high level of product enhancement activity  tecom capitalized million pretax of product development costs in and million in in accordance with accepted accounting practices  capitalized development costs associated with the commercial system capitalized in and are expected to be amortized starting in when tecom anticipates its commercial product will be available for general distribution 
bosek  gibson and associates  inc bga  an energy services company headquartered in tampa with seven offices in florida and two in california  was acquired in november it provides engineering  construction management and energy services to more than customers  including public schools  universities  health care facilities and other governmental facilities throughout florida and california 
in  it was selected to provide energy services  analysis and economic evaluation by  among others  the jacksonville naval air station and the suncoast district of the united states postal service 
bga is working with both peoples gas system and tecom throughout florida to make integrated product and services offerings that are energy source neutral 
in  bga began to transition from a traditional engineering services company to a company focused more on energy performance contracting 
diversified companies operating revenues unconsolidated diversified revenues rose four percent in  from increased third party and tampa electric business at teco transport  increased third party sales at teco coal  and increased utilization of teco power services alborada station in guatemala 
in  diversified revenues also reflected a full year of revenues for bga  acquired in november in  the diversified companies achieved a percent increase in revenues 
the largest increases occurred at teco coal from higher sales to third parties  at teco coalbed methane from higher gas prices  and at teco power services from a full year of operations at the alborada power station in guatemala 
diversified companies operating expenses operating expenses increased five percent in  due to higher production at teco coal  increased fleet utilization at teco transport and the interest on new limited recourse project debt at teco power services 
diversified companies operating expenses increased percent in difficult underground mining conditions at teco coal s gatliff mines increased costs and led to the closing of several mines 
higher fuel prices at teco transport and a full year of operations at teco power services alborada power station also contributed to increased operating expenses 
discontinued operations in august  teco energy announced its intent to exit the conventional oil and gas exploration and production business because of the small scale of the operations and earnings volatility inherent in an oil and gas business of this size 
in  teco energy reported an after tax loss from discontinued operations of million including the write off of a group of three offshore wells that ceased producing and the net results up to the decision to exit the business 
in addition  a million after tax loss from the ongoing drilling program subsequent to the decision  was reported as a loss on disposal of discontinued operations 
in march  teco oil gas sold its offshore assets to a subsidiary of american resources of delaware for million  consisting of million in cash and a subordinated note in the amount of million 
teco energy will report an after tax gain on this transaction of about cents per share in the first quarter of teco energy will continue to operate its separate coalbed methane gas production business 
it is not a part of this sale 
year computer systems compliance based on a complete inventory and risk assessment of all hardware  firmware and software systems  teco energy identified three primary areas with year compliance issues the energy control system at tampa electric  mainframe based business systems such as financial reporting and customer billing  and process controllers in power generation facilities  and other operating areas of the teco energy companies 
working with the original equipment manufacturers and other users  tampa electric began modifying the energy control system in and expects the system to be year compliant by the end of in early  teco energy began using a contractor specializing in year conversions to make mainframe business applications compliant and expects conversion and testing to be completed by the end of process controllers throughout the corporation are being modified or replaced in the normal course of business with compliance expected in all areas by the end of the cost to make all of teco energy s equipment  systems and processes year compliant is expected to be about million  of which approximately million was reflected in results 
teco energy is surveying all major suppliers and customers to determine the status and schedule for their year compliance and expects to complete this effort by the middle of if customers and suppliers compliance plans present risks to teco energy  the company plans to identify alternate suppliers and provide assistance where appropriate 
teco energy does not at this time foresee a material impact on its business operations or results associated with achieving year compliance 
non operating items other income expense the dividend requirement for tampa electric preferred stock  included in other income expense  declined in and reflecting the redemption of all outstanding preferred stock 
allowance for other funds used during construction afudc was 
million in  million in and million in with the completion of tampa electric s polk unit one in  afudc is expected to be minimal for the next several years 
interest charges interest charges were million in  up seven percent  reflecting lower afudc on borrowed funds at tampa electric 
in  interest charges were million  up three percent from primarily due to the expiration of an interest rate swap agreement 
income taxes income tax expense increased in reflecting higher pretax income and the effect of lower afudc on equity funds at tampa electric 
income tax expense increased in primarily from increases in pretax income 
income tax expense as a percent of income from continuing operations before taxes was percent in  percent in and percent in total income tax expense was reduced by the federal tax credit related to the production of coalbed methane 
this tax credit totaled million in  million in and million in the tax credit rate was estimated at per mcf in  up from in and in this rate escalates with inflation and could be limited by domestic oil prices 
in domestic oil prices would have had to exceed per barrel for this limitation to have been effective 
the federal tax credit on production of coalbed methane is available through the year the income tax effect of losses from discontinued operations is shown as a component of results from discontinued operations 
business development activity in january  teco energy acquired an additional florida propane gas business  griffis gas  inc  in a stock for stock merger transaction that was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
about  shares of teco energy common stock were issued in the transaction 
griffis gas  inc  was a privately owned business operating in northern peninsular florida  mainly in the jacksonville area  and in gainesville and ocala 
an affiliated company which transports propane for griffis gas  us propane  inc  was also acquired 
both of the acquired companies operate as a part of peoples gas company  this acquisition is expected to increase peoples gas company s annual volume by about one third 
in the first quarter of  teco power services and a local partner were awarded the right to provide a megawatt diesel powered plant in pavana  honduras with an estimated cost of million 
the award was made in connection with a declaration of electric emergency by the president of honduras 
teco power services and its local partner are presently negotiating the terms of their interests in the project and a year power sales agreement with the honduran national utility 
i n march  teco transport s river barge transportation subsidiary  mid south towing  chartered three towboats and covered river barges under an agreement that provides for their acquisition at t h e end of the five year charter term 
this additional river transportation equipment is expected to be used to expand teco transport s service offerings 
accounting standards reporting comprehensive income in the financial accounting standards board issued financial accounting standard fas  reporting comprehensive income  effective for fiscal years beginning after dec 
 the new standard requires that comprehensive income  which includes net income as well as certain changes in assets and liabilities recorded in common equity  be reported in the financial statements 
teco energy does not expect this standard to have a significant impact on its reporting practices 
segment reporting fas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  effective for fiscal years beginning after dec 
 establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments in annual financial statements and interim financial reports issued to shareholders 
generally  certain financial information is required to be reported on the basis that is used internally for evaluating performance of and allocation of resources to operating segments 
teco energy has not yet determined to what extent the standard will impact its current practice of reporting operating segment information 
capital expenditures teco energy s capital expenditures of million consisted of million for tampa electric  million for peoples gas system and million for the diversified companies 
tampa electric spent million in for equipment and facilities to meet its growing customer base and for generating equipment improvements 
peoples gas system spent million for system expansion and normal equipment replacement 
teco transport invested million in for the purchase of a  ton ship  a program of barge enlargement and refurbishment  and normal equipment replacement 
teco coal spent million for an expansion of its clintwood operations and acquisition of new mining equipment 
teco power services spent million for initial design work for the san jose power station in guatemala 
teco oil gas spent million for natural gas exploration and development 
t e co energy estimates total capital expenditures for ongoing operations to be million for and million during the period 
of these amounts  tampa electric expects to spend million in and million during the period  mainly for d i s tribution facilities to meet customer growth and generation reliability programs 
tampa electric s capital expenditure projections include about million over the period to comply with phase ii of the clean air act as described in the environmental compliance section 
the level of capital expenditures that will actually be required for compliance is uncertain at this time 
capital requirements for peoples gas system are expected to be about million in and million during the period for infrastructure expansion to grow the customer base and normal asset replacement 
the diversified companies expect capital expenditures of about million in and million during the period 
included in these amounts are the acquisition of coal mining equipment and mine development costs  acquisition of replacement river barges and ocean transportation equipment and normal asset replacement 
at the end of  million had been committed 
included in these estimates for the diversified companies are million over the next three years at teco power services for the construction of the san jose power station in guatemala and the pavana project in honduras 
teco power services is seeking external debt financing for the remainder of its share of the construction costs  and expects to use limited recourse project debt financing after completion 
environmental compliance teco energy and its subsidiaries are subject to various environmental regulations 
teco energy believes that it and all of its subsidiaries are substantially in compliance with the currently applicable standards of the various environmental enforcement agencies and that potential environmental liabilities are not material 
tampa electric company is a potentially responsible party for certain superfund sites and  through its peoples gas system division  for certain former manufactured gas plant sites 
while the joint and several liability associated with these sites presents the potential for significant response costs  tampa electric company estimates its ultimate financial liability could be up to million over the next ten years 
the environmental remediation costs associated with these sites are not expected to have a material impact on customer prices 
tampa electric is complying with the phase i emission limitations imposed by the clean air act amendments which became effective jan 
 by using blends of lower sulfur coal  controlling stack emissions and using emission allowances 
tampa electric is currently evaluating options to comply with phase ii sulfur dioxide emission standards set for the year the options include adding a scrubber or switching to lower sulfur fuels 
it is also evaluating options to comply with phase ii of the clean air act amendments for nitrogen oxide nox reductions 
these options include combustion modifications and retrofit control technology 
while tampa electric s estimates reflected in the capital expenditure section include million for compliance with all phase ii requirements including nox reductions 
the actual level of required expenditures is uncertain at this time  however  it would be higher if the option of scrubbing additional capacity is chosen 
in any event  tampa electric believes that the cost of compliance with phase ii  which would be reflected in customers bills  is not expected to have a material impact on its prices 
utility regulation return on equity roe and other regulatory agreements rate stabilization strategy building on an fpsc approved agreement in  tampa electric s objective has been to place the polk power station in service without increasing the total price for electric service while earning a fair return 
to meet this objective the company took action to significantly reduce costs 
another key component of the strategy to accomplish this objective was the deferral and subsequent recognition of revenues 
with the agreements approved by the fpsc in and  the objectives of stabilizing prices through and securing fair earnings opportunities during this period are being accomplished 
in  the fpsc approved a plan submitted by tampa electric to defer revenues for under this plan tampa electric s allowed roe increased to an percent midpoint with a range of percent to percent 
for an initial million of revenues were deferred as well as percent of actual revenues in excess of a roe of percent up to a net earned roe of percent and all actual revenues above a roe of percent 
in tampa electric deferred million of revenues under this plan 
the deferred revenues accrue interest at the day commercial paper rate as specified in the florida administrative code 
also as part of this plan  tampa electric s oil backout tariff was eliminated jan 
  an annual revenue reduction of approximately million 
in may  the fpsc issued an order approving an agreement among tampa electric  the florida office of public counsel opc and the florida industrial power users group fipug on a multi year base rate freeze and refund plan 
under this plan  base rates were frozen through and tampa electric s customers received a million refund over months starting in october the refund consisted of million of revenues deferred from and million of revenues 
in addition  the agreement set forth a multi year plan for allocating revenues based on tampa electric s roe 
for the years through tampa electric retains all revenues contributing to a roe up to percent 
any additional revenues will be allocated according to a formula 
in  percent of any actual revenues contributing to a roe in excess of percent were included in revenues 
the remaining percent were deferred for use in and in  percent of any revenues that contributed to a roe in excess of percent up to percent were included in revenues 
the remaining percent were deferred for use in as were any revenues contributing to a roe in excess of percent 
the same percent allocation will be made in after taking into account any deferred revenues not used in previous years 
the remaining percent  as well as any revenues contributing to a roe in excess of percent will be refunded to customers in under these agreements million of revenues were deferred 
approximately million of revenues deferred from and plus million of interest  after the effect of the million refund  were available for use in and tampa electric recognized million in and is expected to recognize up to million of previously deferred revenues in in october  the fpsc unanimously approved an agreement among tampa electric  opc and fipug that resolved all pending regulatory issues associated with the polk power station 
the agreement allows the full recovery of the capital costs incurred in the polk power station project 
the agreement also calls for an extension of the base rate freeze established in the may agreement through tampa electric has the option of filing an application with the fpsc on or after july  for authorization to adjust base rates after jan 
 under the october agreement  the million refund established in the may agreement remained intact and  in addition  customers began receiving a million temporary base rate reduction reflected as a credit on customer bills over a month period beginning oct 
 this temporary base rate reduction will be netted against any refunds that otherwise might have been made in under the may agreement 
in  percent of the revenues contributing to a roe in excess of percent will be refunded to customers in along with any revenues which contribute to a roe above percent 
tampa electric agreed to remove from rate base the million investment made in land at port manatee 
this land has value for uses other than as a power plant site  and will continue to be recorded as an asset of tampa electric 
in  a citizens task force recommended using previously mined land in polk county over the manatee site as the preferred location for the polk power station 
tampa electric s results under these agreements are subject to fpsc review and audit 
wholesale power sales contracts in september  the fpsc ruled that costs associated with two long term  wholesale power sales contracts should be assigned to the wholesale jurisdiction and that for retail rate making purposes  the costs transferred from retail to wholesale should reflect average costs rather than the lower incremental costs on which the two contracts are based 
as a result of this decision and the related reduction of the retail rate base upon which tampa electric is allowed to earn a return  these contracts became uneconomic 
see tampa electric operating results section 
environmental cost recovery clause in  tampa electric recovered million of environmental compliance costs through the environmental cost recovery clause 
these are costs incurred by tampa electric after april to comply with environmental regulations enacted  or which became effective subsequent to the test year of tampa electric s most recent full regulatory price setting proceeding but not included in current rates 
tampa electric will continue to seek recovery of these types of costs through this clause until the next full regulatory price setting proceeding 
under the october agreement the earliest any such new prices could be in effect is in the year utility competition electric tampa electric s retail electric business is substantially free from direct competition with other electric utilities  municipalities and public agencies 
at the present time  the principal form of competition at the retail level consists of natural gas for residences and businesses and the self generation option available to larger users of electric energy 
such users may seek to expand their options through various initiatives including legislative and or regulatory changes that would permit competition at the retail level 
one such initiative  described below  involves a proposed merchant power plant with a claimed self generation use 
tampa electric intends to take all appropriate actions to retain and expand its retail business  including managing costs and providing high quality service to retail customers 
such action might  with the approval of the fpsc  include the use of load retention and or economic development service contracts and tariffs to reduce the loss of existing load and or acquire additional load 
there is presently active competition in the wholesale power markets in florida  and this is increasing largely as a result of the energy policy act of and related federal initiatives 
this act removed certain regulatory barriers to independent power producers and required utilities to transmit power from such producers  utilities and others to wholesale customers as more fully described below 
in april  the federal energy regulatory commission ferc issued its final rule on open access non discriminatory transmission  stranded costs  open access same time information system oasis and standards of conduct 
these rules work together to open access for wholesale power flows on transmission systems 
utilities owning transmission facilities including tampa electric are required to provide services to wholesale transmission customers comparable to those they provide to themselves on comparable terms and conditions including price 
among other things  the rules require transmission services to be unbundled from power sales and owners of transmission systems must take transmission service under their own transmission tariffs 
transmission system owners are also required to implement an oasis system providing  via the internet  access to transmission service information including price and availability  and to rely exclusively on their own oasis system for such information for purposes of their own wholesale power transactions 
to facilitate compliance  owners must implement standards of conduct to ensure that personnel involved in marketing of wholesale power are functionally separated from personnel involved in transmission services and reliability functions 
tampa electric  together with other utilities  has implemented an oasis system and believes it is in compliance with the standards of conduct 
merchant power plants in a fpsc informational workshop to address long range power supply planning  questions were raised as to whether merchant power plants  i 
e plants built on speculation with a portion or all of their capacity not subject to purchase agreements  could or should be p e r m i t ted to serve growing customer demand for electricity 
subsequently  utilities  cogeneration independent power producers and power marketers presented views before the fpsc on the applicability of existing law and regulations to merchant power plants 
tampa electric presented its position that only utilities or entities with contracts to serve the long term needs of an individual utility could legally be applicants under the florida power plant siting act ppsa 
the ppsa governs the building of new generation and requires the applicant to demonstrate that a plant is needed prior to receiving construction and operating permits 
in subsequent declaratory statement proceedings addressing specifically a proposed duke imca power plant discussed below  and a project with a municipal utility  proposed by duke  the fpsc denied duke s petitions and determined that the issue of the ability of merchant power plants to be applicants under the ppsa needed to be addressed in a more inclusive proceeding 
it is uncertain at this time whether or how the fpsc will proceed on this issue 
in  imca and duke announced that they had signed a letter of intent for the construction of a natural gas fired combined cycle power plant with a minimum capacity of megawatts to serve retail load currently served by tampa electric and two other utilities  and the merchant wholesale function described above 
tampa electric and others objected to the proposed project on the ground that it involved retail transactions within defined service areas that are prohibited under existing florida regulation 
prior to an fpsc ordered evidentiary hearing to determine if the proposed project should be considered permitted self generation or a prohibited retail sale  imca withdrew its petition 
as a result  the status of the proposed project is unclear at this time 
i f the duke imca project or similar projects by others are successfully pursued there would be an adverse effect on tampa electric s retail operations  with some likely cost shifting to other retail customers 
likewise  if necessary regulatory or legislative actions are taken that result in the construction of wholesale merchant power plants  tampa electric s wholesale operations would be adversely affected 
utility competition gas p g s is not in direct competition with any other regulated distributors of natural gas for customers within its service areas 
at the present time  the principal form of competition for residential and small commercial customers is from companies providing other sources of energy and energy services 
competition is most prevalent in the large commercial and industrial markets 
in recent years  these classes of customers have been targeted by companies seeking to sell gas directly either using pgs facilities or transporting gas through other facilities  thereby bypassing pgs facilities 
in response to this competition  various programs have been developed by pgs including the provision of transportation services at discounted rates 
in general  pgs faces competition from other energy source suppliers offering fuel oil  electricity and in some cases liquid propane gas 
p g s has taken actions to retain and expand its commodity and transportation business  including managing costs and providing high quality service to customers 
purchased gas adjustment changes in the cost of gas sold are passed along to customers through the fpsc approved purchased gas adjustment pga clause 
gas unbundling in some areas of the country  gas service for large customers has become unbundled  with these customers able to choose a third party supplier of the gas commodity and to secure from the distribution company transportation only service 
pgs is already largely unbundled with percent of the system throughput coming from third party suppliers 
the fpsc staff has issued a draft tariff which would allow all customers  except residential  the right to take transportation only service and purchase gas from third parties 
pgs is opposed to this proposal unless there is a showing of benefit to the general body of customers 
it is unclear whether the fpsc staff action will lead to fpsc action requiring further unbundling 
investment activity at dec

the bonds were issued at a tax exempt rate of and will mature on dec 
 the proceeds of the issue were used to repay short term debt incurred during the construction of the polk power station 
teco energy raised million of common equity in and million in from the sale of common stock through its dividend reinvestment and common stock purchase plan drp 
in  the drp purchased teco energy shares on the open market for plan participants 
in july  tampa electric retired all of its outstanding shares of cumulative preferred stock at per share redemption prices of for series a  for series b and for series d 
in april tampa electric retired series e and series f preferred stock at redemption prices of and  respectively 
in january  teco power services secured million of long term limited recourse debt financing for its alborada power station in guatemala 
proceeds repaid short term debt that had funded the construction of the station 
in  teco energy repaid million of maturing medium term notes and redeemed million of long term debt assumed in the west florida gas and peoples gas companies mergers 
as a part of its risk management program  during teco energy entered into an interest rate exchange agreement to moderate its exposure to short term interest rate changes 
this three year agreement effectively converted the interest rate on million of short term debt from a floating rate to a fixed rate 
teco finance pays a fixed rate of and receives a floating rate based on a day commercial paper index 
the benefits of this agreement are at risk only in the event of non performance by the other party to the agreement  which the company does not anticipate 
this agreement did not have a significant impact on interest expense in or teco energy enters into futures and options contracts  from time to time  to hedge the selling price for teco coalbed methane s physical production and to limit its exposure to gas price increases in both the regulated peoples gas system and the unregulated propane business 
teco energy does not use derivative or other hedging instruments for speculative purposes

 teco energy had unused bank credit lines of million 
teco energy anticipates meeting its capital requirements for ongoing operations in the period substantially from internally generated funds 
teco power services expects to finance the san jose power station with limited recourse project financing upon completion of construction 
based upon anticipated revenue growth and effective cost management in all of its current businesses and identified capital expenditures  teco energy expects to generate  after dividends  about million of free cash flow through the year this amount would be available to further grow the business and strengthen the balance sheet 
investment considerations the following are certain of the factors that could affect teco energy s future results 
they should be considered in connection with evaluating forward looking statements contained in this management s discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this report and otherwise made by or on the behalf of teco energy  since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in these forward looking statements 
general economic conditions 
the company s businesses are dependent on general economic conditions 
in particular  the projected growth in florida and tampa electric s service area is important to the realization of tampa electric s and the peoples gas companies forecasts for annual energy sales growth for and beyond 
an unanticipated downturn in florida s or the local area s economy could adversely affect tampa electric s or the peoples gas companies performance  through time 
the activities of the diversified businesses  particularly teco transport and teco coal  are also affected by general economic conditions in the respective industries and geographic areas they serve  both nationally and internationally 
weather variations 
most of teco energy s businesses are affected by variations in general weather conditions and unusually severe weather 
tampa electric s and the peoples gas companies energy sales are particularly sensitive to variations in weather conditions 
the teco energy companies forecast energy sales on the basis of normal weather  which represents a long term historical average 
significant variations from normal weather could have a material impact on energy sales 
unusual weather  such as hurricanes  could also have an effect on operating costs as well as sales 
peoples gas system and peoples gas company are more weather sensitive with a single winter peak period than tampa electric with both summer and winter peak periods 
mild winter weather in florida can be expected to negatively impact results at these peoples gas companies 
variations in weather conditions also affect the demand and prices for the commodities sold by teco coalbed methane and teco coal 
teco transport is also impacted by weather because of its effects on the supply of and demand for the products transported 
severe weather conditions that could interrupt or slow service and increase operating costs also affects these businesses 
potential competitive changes 
the electric industry has been undergoing certain restructuring 
competition in wholesale power sales has been introduced on a national level 
some states have mandated or encouraged competition at the retail level  and in some situations required divestiture of generating assets 
while there is active wholesale competition in florida  the retail electric business has remained substantially free from direct competition 
changes in the competitive environment occasioned by legislation  regulation  market conditions or initiatives of other electric power providers  however  particularly with respect to retail competition  could adversely affect tampa electric s business and its performance 
the gas distribution industry has been subject to competitive forces for several years 
further unbundling of gas service could adversely affect peoples gas system 
regulatory actions 
tampa electric and peoples gas system operate in highly regulated industries 
their retail operations  including the prices charged  are regulated by the fpsc  and tampa electric s w h olesale power sales and transmission services are subject to regulation by ferc 
changes in regulatory requirements or adverse regulatory actions could have an adverse effect on either tampa electric s or peoples gas system s performance 
commodity price changes 
most of teco energy s businesses are sensitive to changes in certain commodity prices 
such changes could affect the prices they charge  their operating costs and the competitive position of their products and services 
in the case of tampa electric  fuel costs used for generation are mostly affected by the cost of coal 
tampa electric is able to recover the cost of fuel through retail customers bills  but increases in fuel costs affect electric prices and therefore the competitive position of electricity against other energy sources 
on the wholesale side  the ability to make sales and the margins on power sales are affected by the cost of coal to tampa electric  particularly as it relates to the cost of gas and oil to other power producers 
in the case of peoples gas system  costs for purchased gas and pipeline capacity are recovered through retail customers bills  but increases in gas costs affect total retail prices and therefore the competitive position of peoples gas relative to electricity  other forms of energy and other gas suppliers 
at the diversified companies  changes in gas and coal prices directly affect the margins at teco coalbed methane and teco coal 
environmental matters 
teco energy s businesses are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities dealing with air  water and other environmental matters 
changes in and compliance with these regulations may impose additional costs on the company  or result in the curtailment of certain activities
