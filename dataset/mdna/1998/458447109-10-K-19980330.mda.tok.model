the discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto on pages f through f and the summary consolidated data included elsewhere in this report 
overview of results was a productive year for the company  highlighted by significant loan growth  solid earnings performance  and an improvement in asset quality 
as a result of the sustained earnings and capital growth  the quarterly dividend paid on common stock was increased in to an annualized rate of as compared to in net income for the year ended december  was million as compared with million in  an increase of 
for the same period basic earnings per common share rose to from in as a result  the company s relevant earnings performance measures remained strong 
the company s returns on average equity and average assets were and  respectively  in as compared to and  respectively  in earnings for were favorably affected by an increase in net interest income of million or compared to the previous year 
the enhancement resulted from strong loan growth and an improved net interest margin 
average total loans increased million or  of which million of the growth was comprised of consumer and residential mortgage loans 
net interest income also benefited from the growth in interest bearing and non interest bearing demand deposits which increased on average million or 
the strong loan growth  combined with an increase in low cost deposit liabilities  improved the net interest margin to  an increase of basis points over net income for was adversely affected by an increase of thousand in the provision for loan losses as compared to the increase is mainly attributable to the growth of the loan portfolio  particularly commercial loans which typically carry higher levels of inherent credit risk 
net income for was favorably affected by a pretax gain of million resulting from the sale of two commercial mortgage loans and a pretax gain of thousand related to the collection of principal on a loan in excess of its carrying value 
the effects of these gains on earnings  when compared to the prior year  were partly offset by net pretax gains of thousand realized in related to the sale of deposits of a branch location  the sale of available for sale afs securities and the collection of principal on a loan in excess of its carrying value 
in  the company continued to invest in technology and other tools to deliver faster more efficient services to its customers 
notwithstanding such investments the company managed to control noninterest expenses which decreased by to million and helped improve earnings 
in  the company reported net income of million or basic earnings per common share  as compared with million or basic earnings per common share in the bank s return on average equity and average assets were and  respectively  in as compared to and  respectively  in net income for was favorably affected by an increase in net interest income of thousand or  as compared to due largely to an improved net interest margin 
the net interest margin increased basis points in  as compared to  and was augmented by growth in average interest earning assets from levels 
the growth occurred in loans which generally are the higher yielding assets for the company 
the net interest margin was also positively affected by growth in average noninterest bearing deposits of million or  from levels of million 
furthermore  net interest income was positively affected by a favorable change in average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities resulting from a favorable shift in the mix of the company s interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  net income for was beneficially affected by a decrease of thousand in the provision for loan losses as compared to the decrease was mainly attributable to improved trends with respect to nonperforming loans and a decline in charge off experience in as compared to net income for included the effects of the following pretax gains a net gain of thousand resulting from the sale of deposits of one of the company s branch locations  a net gain of thousand from the sale of afs securities  and  a gain of thousand related to the collection of principal on a loan in excess of its carrying value 
the aforementioned gains did not serve to increase net income for over mainly due to a net gain of thousand in related to the sale of a portion of the subsidiary bank s loan servicing portfolio 
the benefits obtained from the improved net interest income and decrease in the provision for loan losses were partially offset by an increase of thousand or in operating expenses for  as compared to table summary of operating results net income in thousands    basic earnings per common share diluted earnings per common share return on average total assets return on average total equity dividend payout ratio average total stockholders equity to average total assets cash dividends declared on common and preferred shares to net income 
net interest income net interest income is the difference between the interest a company earns on its assets  principally loans and investment securities  and interest it pays on its deposits and borrowings 
when expressed as a percentage of average assets  it is referred to as net interest margin  or simply interest margin

loan losses the provision for loan losses represents management s determination of the amount necessary to bring the allowance for loan losses to the level it considers adequate to reflect the risk of future losses in the loan portfolio 
factors considered in the evaluation include past loss experience  changes in the composition of nonperforming loans  the condition of borrowers facing financial pressure  the relationship of the current level of the allowance to the portfolio and to nonperforming loans  loan concentrations and economic conditions 
loan loss provisions for amounted to million  an increase of thousand from the previous year 
the bank s lending focus and growth have been largely in its commercial and commercial mortgage loan portfolio 
such growth and concentration can change the characteristics and potentially increase the inherent credit risk in the bank s loan portfolio 
as a result  during  the bank has increased its allowance for loan losses to capture such risk which resulted in an increase in the provision for loan losses 
in  the loan loss provision amounted to thousand  a decrease of thousand from the decrease in the provision for loan losses reflected  in part  the positive trends in nonperforming loans 
in addition  it reflected the decrease in charge off experience during net loans charged off against the allowance for loan losses in amounted to thousand  down thousand from million in see sections on loan portfolio and loan quality beginning on page of this report for additional discussions pertaining to the allowance for loan losses

noninterest income noninterest income consists of all income other than interest and dividend income and is derived from fees on bank transactions and credit cards  commissions on sales of annuities and mutual funds  rental of safe deposit space and net gains on sales of assets 
noninterest income totaled million for  an increase of thousand or from million for for  total noninterest income decreased thousand or from million for the year ended december  the elements that significantly contributed to the changes in noninterest income are highlighted below 
the increase in noninterest income for compared to was largely due to a million pretax gain from the sale of two commercial mortgage loans and a thousand increase in service fees collected on deposit accounts 
service charges to non customers for use of the subsidiary bank s atm machines contributed thousand to the increase in service fee income 
further contributing to the improved noninterest income in compared to was an increase of thousand relating to the collection of principal in excess of reserves on loans purchased at a discount 
these benefits  however  were partially offset by net pretax gains  recognized in  of thousand from the sale of deposits of a branch location and from the sale of available for sale securities which were sold as part of a securities portfolio restructuring plan 
noninterest income for also included thousand of discount accretion in connection with a past acquisition that did not reoccur in in addition to the benefits  mentioned previously  noninterest income for  also benefited from a thousand gain related to the collection of principal on loans in excess of their carrying value 
the benefits described above did not result in an increase to noninterest income in over largely because of a net pretax gain in of thousand pertaining to the sale of a portion of the subsidiary bank s loan servicing portfolio 
consequently  noninterest income for decreased  in large part  because the discount connected with an acquisition of a failed financial institution had been fully accreted 
discount accretion contributed thousand less to noninterest income in as compared to table noninterest income for the years ended december  in thousands service fees on deposit accounts    service fees on loan accounts service fees on credit cards net gain on sale of loans  net gain on sale of securities commission on annuity and mutual fund sales accretion of discount in connection with acquisition collection of acquired loans in excess of carrying value rental on safe deposit boxes net gain on sale of deposits of a branch location net gain on sale of loan servicing rights all other noninterest expenses noninterest expenses totaled million for this represented a decrease of thousand or from total noninterest expenses of million for for  total noninterest expenses increased thousand or from million for the year ended december  the elements that significantly contributed to the changes in noninterest expenses are highlighted below 
the decrease in noninterest expenses for was attributable  in part  to a thousand decline in foreclosed real estate expense resulting from the workout and sale of the company s foreclosed real estate during the first half of the year 
also contributing to the improvement in noninterest expenses was a decrease in federal deposit insurance corporation fdic assessment due to a one time fdic special assessment charged in furthermore  net occupancy and furniture and equipment costs decreased thousand 
this decrease was mainly the result of closing two branch offices during and the purchase of a previously leased branch location during coupled with a decline in maintenance costs incurred at all the company s locations 
an increase of thousand in salaries and benefits due primarily to annual salary increases and promotions partially offset the benefits described above 
affecting the change in noninterest expenses for was an increase of thousand or in salaries and related expenses 
for the most part  the increase resulted from promotions and normal annual salary adjustments 
an increase of thousand or in other noninterest expenses also contributed to the change 
the increase reflects a thousand reduction of other noninterest expenses in for the reversal of a reserve related to a settled lawsuit 
furthermore  noninterest expenses were adversely affected by an increase of thousand or in foreclosed real estate expenses 
in  foreclosed real estate expense included net losses of thousand pertaining to the disposition of foreclosed real estate as compared to net gains of thousand for in  noninterest expenses were favorably affected by a thousand or decrease in insurance premiums paid by the company to the fdic for deposit insurance 
the decrease reflects the reduction in premium as the bank insurance fund attained target reserve levels

beginning january  effects of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
loan portfolio the company  during  continued to experience strong growth in its loan portfolio 
at december   total loans amounted to million  up million or over the previous year 
promotional campaigns in conjunction with competitive loan rates and focused sales efforts were instrumental to the loan growth 
the loan growth was largely in the subsidiary bank s delineated community which confirms the company s pledge of striving to be the largest community based banking organization in bergen county  dedicated to community service and helping its customers grow and prosper 
in  total loans increased million from the level 
the increase was largely the result of promotional campaigns and competitive loan rates as well as the ability of the company to identify and meet the needs of its business customers 
commercial real estate mortgage loans amounted to million at december   and represented of total loans compared to million or of all loans at the end of these loans are secured primarily by first priority mortgage liens on owner occupied commercial properties

loans must meet the tests of a prudent loan  which include criteria regarding the character  capacity and capital of the borrower  collateral provided for the loan and prevailing economic conditions 
the company obtains an independent appraisal of real property  within regulatory guidelines  when it is considered the primary collateral for a loan 
the company employs a full time loan review officer who evaluates the credit risk for substantially all large commercial loans 
this review process is intended to identify adverse developments in individual credits  regardless of whether such credits are also included on the watchlist discussed below and whether or not the loans are delinquent 
the loan review officer reports directly to the president of the company 
management maintains a watchlist system under which credit officers are required to provide early warning of possible deteriorations in loans 
these loans may not be delinquent currently  but may present indications of financial weakness  such as deteriorating financial ratios of the borrowers  or other concerns at an early stage to allow early implementation of responsive credit strategies 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans  restructured loans and foreclosed real estate 
foreclosed real estate  representing real estate collateral acquired by legal foreclosure procedures  is valued using independent appraisals and the company s policy is to review such appraisals annually 
the company intends to dispose of each property at or near its current valuation 
however  there can be no assurance that disposals will be made as soon as anticipated or at expected values

conversely  time deposits in amounts under  decreased million or to million as compared to year end the positive change in the mix of deposit liabilities reflects the company s continued emphasis of building core deposit relationships to supplant a portion of its higher costing deposit liabilities 
the outflow of the higher costing time deposits was more than offset by the growth in low cost demand deposits

therefore  managing the company s interest rate sensitivity is a primary objective of the company s senior management 
the company s asset liability committee alco is responsible for managing the exposure to changes in market interest rates 
alco attempts to maintain stable net interest margins by periodically evaluating the relationship between interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities 
the evaluation attempts to determine the impact on net interest margin from current and prospective changes in market interest rates 
the company manages interest rate risk exposure with the utilization of financial modeling and simulation techniques 
these methods assist the company in determining the effects of market rate changes on net interest income and future economic value 
the objective of the company is to maximize net interest income within acceptable levels of risk established by policy 
the techniques utilized for managing exposure to market rate changes involve a variety of interest rate  pricing and volume assumptions 
these assumptions include projections on growth  prepayment and withdrawal levels as well as other embedded options inherently found in financial instruments 
the company periodically reviews and validates these assumptions 
at december   the company simulated the effects on net interest income given an instantaneous and parallel shift in the yield curve of basis points in either direction 
based on the simulation  it was estimated that net interest income  over a twelve month horizon  would not decrease by more than 
at december   the company was within policy limits established for changes in net interest income and future economic value 
the preceding simulation does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cashflows  and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the simulation  actual results will also differ due to prepayment refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal external variable 
furthermore  the simulation does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates 
in addition to the above mentioned techniques  the company utilizes sensitivity gap as an interest rate risk measurement 
sensitivity gap is determined by analyzing the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same period of time 
sensitivity gap provides an indication of the extent to which the company s net interest income may be affected by future changes in market interest rates 
the cumulative gap position as a percentage of total assets provides one relative measure of the company s interest rate exposure 
the cumulative gap between the company s interest rate sensitive assets and its interest rate sensitive liabilities repricing within a one year period was at december  since the cumulative gap was negative  the company has a negative gap position which theoretically will cause its assets to reprice more slowly than its deposit liabilities 
in a declining interest rate environment  interest costs may be expected to fall faster than the interest received on earning assets  thus increasing the net interest spread 
if interest rates increase  a negative gap means that the interest received on earning assets may be expected to increase more slowly than the interest paid on the company s liabilities therefore decreasing the net interest spread 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in table 
although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
the rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market rates  while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market rates 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
the ability of borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
management considers these factors when reviewing its gap position and establishing its ongoing asset liability strategy

liquidity management is critical to the stability of the company 
liquidity levels over any given period of time are a product of the company s operating  financing and investing activities 
the extent of such activities are often shaped by such external factors as competition for deposits and loan demand 
traditionally  financing for the company s loans and investments is derived primarily from deposits  along with interest and principal payments on loans and investments 
at december   total deposits amounted to million  an increase of million or over the prior comparable year 
during  the company continued to use advances from the federal home loan bank of new york fhlb and securities sold under agreements to repurchase repos to supplement the more traditional funding sources 
at december   advances from the fhlb and repos amounted to million and million  respectively  as compared to million and million  respectively  at december  in  loan production continued to be the company s principal investing activity 
net loans at december  amounted to million  compared to million at the end of  an increase of million or 
the company s most liquid assets are cash and due from banks and federal funds sold 
at december   the total of such assets amounted to million or of total assets  compared to million or of total assets at year end another significant liquidity source is the company s available for sale afs securities 
at december   afs securities amounted to million or of total securities  compared to million or of total securities at year end in addition to the aforementioned sources of liquidity  the company has available various other sources of liquidity  including federal funds purchased from other banks and the federal reserve discount window 
the bank also has a million line of credit available through its membership in the federal home loan bank of new york 
management believes that the company s sources of funds are sufficient to meet its funding requirements 
capital adequacy stockholders equity totaled million and represents of total assets at december   compared to million and of total assets at december  the million increase was primarily attributable to net income of million less cash dividends of million 
guidelines issued by the federal reserve board and the fdic establish capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies and state chartered banks 
the guidelines establish a risk based capital framework consisting of a definition of capital consisting of tier capital  which includes common shareholders equity less certain intangibles and a supplementary component called tier ii  which includes a portion of the allowance for loan losses  and a system for assigning assets and off balance sheet items to one of the four weighted risk categories  with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing the greater risks 
an institution s risk based capital ratio is determined by dividing its qualifying capital by its risk weighted assets 
the guidelines make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking institutions  take off balance sheet items into account in assessing capital adequacy  and minimize the disincentive to holding liquid  low risk assets 
banking organizations are generally expected to operate with capital positions well above the minimum rates 
institutions with higher levels of risk  or which experience or anticipate significant growth  are also expected to operate well above minimum capital standards 
these guidelines focus principally on broad categories of credit risk  although the framework for assigning assets and off balance sheet items to risk categories does incorporate elements of transfer risk 
the risk based capital ratio does not  however  incorporate other factors that may affect a company s financial condition  such as overall interest rate exposure  liquidity  funding and market risks  the quality and level of earnings  investment or loan concentrations  the quality of loans and investments  the effectiveness of loan and investment policies and management s ability to monitor and control financial and operating risks 
in addition to the risk based guidelines discussed above  the federal reserve board and the fdic require that a bank holding company and bank which meet the regulators highest performance and operation standards and which are not contemplating or experiencing significant growth maintain a minimum leverage ratio tier i capital as a percent of quarterly average adjusted assets of 
for those financial institutions with higher levels of risk or that are experiencing or anticipating significant growth  the minimum leverage ratio will be increased 
the year issue many existing computer programs use only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
as a result  the computer applications affected by such programs could fail or produce incorrect results by or at the year the company acknowledges the need to ensure its operations will not be adversely affected by year computer software failures 
software failures due to processing errors  potentially arising from calculations using the year date  are a known risk 
the company has implemented a five step plan that involves awareness  assessment  validation  renovation and implementation 
it is currently assessing the extent to which its systems may be affected and is communicating with all necessary vendors concerning timely and completed remedies for those systems that require modification 
the company is also communicating with all third parties  on which it relies  to assess their progress in evaluating their systems and implementing any corrective measures 
the company has been taking and will continue to pursue all reasonably necessary steps to protect its operations and assets 
it is currently anticipated that by december   the company will be year compliant 
at this time  the company has not yet determined the cost  which will be expensed as incurred  of evaluating its computer software or databases  or of making any modifications required to correct any year problems
