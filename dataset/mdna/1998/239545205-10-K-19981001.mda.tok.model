the quarterly consolidated financial data reflect  in the opinion of management of the company  all adjustments which include only normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the results of operations for such periods 
results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends 
quarters ended june  march  december  september  in thousands  except per share amounts net sales     gross profit     total operating expenses     income from operations     net interest income expense income before provision for income taxes     net income     earnings per common share basic diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding basic     diluted     quarters ended june  march  december  september  in thousands  except per share amounts net sales     gross profit     total operating expenses     income loss from operations    net interest income income before provision for income taxes    net income    earnings per common share basic diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding basic     diluted     seasonal fluctuations the company has historically experienced and expects to continue to experience significant seasonal fluctuations in its sales and other financial results that it believes have resulted and will continue to result primarily from its customers and users buying patterns 
these buying patterns have typically adversely affected orders for the company s products in the third quarter of each fiscal year 
although it is difficult to predict the future seasonality of sales  the company believes that future seasonality should be influenced at least in part by customer and user buying patterns similar to those that have historically affected the company 
quarterly financial results are also affected by new product introductions and line extensions  the timing of large orders  changes in product sales or customer mix  vendor and customer pricing  production levels  supply and manufacturing delays  large customers inventory management and general industry and economic conditions 
the seasonality of the company s financial results and the unpredictability of the factors affecting such seasonality make the company s quarterly and yearly financial results difficult to predict and subject to significant fluctuation

of the  net amount used in the company s financing activities   was used to repurchase  shares of common stock from certain officers and directors 
this amount was partially offset by  and  that were provided by the issuance of common stock upon exercise of then outstanding stock options and warrants  respectively 
accounts receivable net at june  increased by  or  from the amount at june  primarily due to the growth in sales 
the average collection period of accounts receivable at june  decreased to days from days at june  inventories increased by  or  from the june  amount primarily because of the inventories of the three companies acquired during fiscal and secondarily because of new and recently introduced products

the fees and expenses  as well as any payments for the filofax shares  will be paid with available cash and with borrowings under the loan agreement 
the company has not incurred significant losses or gains from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the continuing expansion of the company s international operations could  however  result in larger gains or losses as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as those subsidiaries conduct business in whole or in part in foreign currencies 
the company s exposure to the impact of interest changes and foreign currency fluctuations is expected to increase if the proposed acquisition of filofax is completed and the company incurs substantial debt under its new loan agreement 
the company has entered into a call option with respect to the proposed acquisition of filofax and may in the future enter into additional call options or foreign currency exchange contracts  swap agreements or other financial instruments as hedges to moderate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
there can be no assurance that the proposed acquisition of filofax will be completed 
a single currency called the euro will be introduced in certain countries in europe on january   but will not be introduced in england 
the use of a single currency may affect the ability of day runner and other companies to price their products differently in various european markets 
the company has not yet evaluated the impact of the single currency 
the company believes that cash flow from operations  vendor credit  its existing working capital and its bank line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy the company s anticipated cash requirements at least through fiscal nonetheless  the company may seek additional sources of capital as necessary or appropriate to finance acquisitions or to otherwise finance the company s growth or operations  however  there can be no assurance that such funds if needed will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
the year issue refers to the inability of certain computer systems  as well as certain hardware and equipment containing date sensitive data  to recognize accurate dates commencing on or after january  this has the potential to affect the operation of these systems adversely and materially 
day runner has identified four phases in its year compliance efforts discovery  assessment  remediation and applicable testing and verification 
the company has substantially completed the discovery and assessment phases for its own systems and applications and believes that by modifying existing software and converting to new software for certain tasks it can prevent the year transition from posing significant internal operational problems 
the company plans to complete the remediation phase by the second quarter of fiscal year and complete the applicable testing and verification phase by the end of the third quarter of fiscal year day runner currently estimates that total incremental cash requirements related to the year issue will be approximately  to  of which approximately  was incurred as of june  the company does not anticipate that the costs of these modifications and conversions will be material to its financial position or results of operations in any given year 
expenditures will be expensed or capitalized as appropriate 
the cash requirements described above do not include any estimates for costs of year remediation or compliance that may be incurred if the proposed acquisition of filofax is completed 
the company is unable to estimate these costs at this time 
there can be no assurance that the proposed acquisition of filofax will be completed 
day runner is surveying its vendors  customers and others on whom it relies to assure that their systems will be year compliant and that they will be able to continue their business with the company without interruption 
however  there can be no assurance that the systems of other parties on which the company s systems rely will also be compliant or that any failure to be compliant in this area by another party would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems 
furthermore  no assurance can be given that any or all of the company s systems are or will be year compliant  that the ultimate costs required to address the year issue will not exceed the amounts indicated above  or that the impact of any failure to achieve substantial year compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition
