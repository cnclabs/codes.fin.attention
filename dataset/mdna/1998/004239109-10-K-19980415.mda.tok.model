during  the company invested million in its property portfolio of which million was included in accounts payable as of december   including million for new development  million for renovation and tenant replacement at existing centers  million for deferred leasing and other charges and  for non revenue generating capital expenditures at the properties 
as a significant portion of the company s funds from operations are distributed to shareholders  the principal sources of funding for the company s investment activity has historically been through permanent debt financing as well as short term construction and line of credit borrowing from various lenders 
total debt outstanding at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the million increase in debt was primarily a result of funding the investment activity 
at december   million  or  of the outstanding debt was carried at a fixed rate and the remaining million  or  at variable rates 
of the total outstanding debt  million will mature by december   with scheduled maturities of million in  million in and million in as the company currently does not anticipate having sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness  it will need to refinance this indebtedness or select other alternatives based on market conditions at that time 
the company believes that the current loan to value ratios on the collateral properties are at levels which would allow it to fully refinance these loans on commercially competitive terms 
on september   the company closed on a million construction loan with firstrust savings bank firstrust which refinanced and expanded the company s existing million credit facility with firstrust 
this construction loan  which is for the expansion of the mark plaza in edwardsville  pennsylvania  bears interest  payable monthly  at the firstrust commercial reference rate plus and matures in march on march   the company closed on million of fixed rate financing from nomura asset capital corporation 
the loan  which matures in march  is secured by a mortgage on one of the company s properties  bears interest at and requires monthly payments of interest and principal amortized over years 
approximately million of the proceeds were used to retire existing debt with fleet bank of massachusetts  na   was used to pay financing costs  million was deposited in escrows  and the remaining proceeds were used for working capital 
the company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants relating to this facility 
at december   other mortgage notes payable aggregated million and were collateralized by properties and related tenant leases 
interest rates ranged from to 
mortgage payments are due in monthly installments of principal and or interest and mature at various dates through the loan agreements contain customary representations  covenants and events of default

additionally  the principal shareholder has personally guaranteed the repayment of mortgage loans with an aggregate balance of million at december  without consideration from the company 
at december   the company s capitalization consisted of million of debt and million of market equity based on a december  market price of per share 
as part of the company s ongoing strategic evaluation and realignment of its property portfolio  the company completed the sale of the newberry plaza on march  for million  collecting million in net sales proceeds after closing costs and adjustments 
the proceeds were used to supplement working capital 
the company currently estimates that capital outlays for tenant improvements  related renovations and other property improvements will require million during certain tenant improvement costs are being incurred earlier than anticipated because of early termination of leases due to tenant bankruptcies 
of these outlays  million is reflected in accounts payable as of december  furthermore  the company has entered into an agreement whereby it has agreed to pay a tenant at the ledgewood mall million to settle certain litigation see business leasing and expansion so as to proceed with the installation of walmart at the mall 
the company anticipates that cash flow from operating activities will continue to provide adequate capital for all debt service payments  recurring capital improvements  as well as dividend payments in accordance with reit requirements 
however  the company may experience a cash shortfall in if there are delays in obtaining construction financing to fund the above capital outlays 
any delays in construction financing will increase the company s short term reliance on cash from operations to meet these commitments 
in order to meet part of its capital requirements  the company obtained million in construction financing on january  with royal bank of pennsylvania for the construction of a theater at the manahawkin village shopping center 
the loan  which is secured by the center  requires monthly payment of interest only at the lender s prime rate plus basis points and matures in february with additional extension periods available through february in addition  certain amounts currently escrowed with lenders as well as other debt and equity financing alternatives are expected to provide the necessary capital to fund the installation of tenants and achieve continued future growth 
the company  along with most industry analysts  consider funds from operations ffo as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance 
however  ffo does not represent cash generated from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and is not indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
it should not be considered as an alternative to net income for the purpose of evaluating the company s performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
generally  nareit defines ffo as net income loss before gains losses on sales of property  non recurring charges and extraordinary items  adjusted for certain non cash charges  primarily depreciation and amortization of capitalized leasing costs

historical cash flow the following discussion of historical cash flow compares the company s cash flows for the year ended december  with the year ended december  
net cash provided by operating activities decreased  to million in from million in this decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in cash provided by net income as adjusted for non cash expenses including depreciation  amortization  property carrying value adjustment and the write off of deferred financing costs 
this was offset by a  increase in cash provided by changes in operating assets  primarily an increase in accounts payable related to operations in investing activities used million during  a decrease of million from million for due primarily to greater development costs paid associated with the union plaza in new castle  pennsylvania in net cash used in financing activities was million for  representing a million decrease from net cash provided by financing activities of million for this decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in borrowings related to property investment in inflation the company s long term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on the company s net income 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rents based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or  in certain cases  escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indexes 
in addition  many of the company s leases are for terms of less than years  which permit the company to seek to increase rents upon re rental at market rates if rents are below the then existing market rates 
most of the company s leases require the tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation
