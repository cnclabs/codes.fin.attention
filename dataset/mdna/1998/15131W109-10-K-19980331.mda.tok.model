liquidity the company s primary sources of funds are deposits  principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed certificates  fhlb advances  proceeds from maturities of investment securities  short term investments  and funds provided by operations 
while scheduled loan and mortgage backed certificate amortization and short term investments are a relatively predictable source of funds  deposit flows are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions  and competition 
cenit bank is required to maintain specific levels of liquid investments 
current regulations require cenit bank to maintain liquid assets  which include short term assets such as cash  certain time deposits and bankers acceptances  short term us treasury obligations  and mortgage backed certificates with final maturities of five years or less  as well as certain long term assets  equal to not less than of its net withdrawable accounts plus short term borrowings

the company s liquidity could be impacted by a decrease in the renewals of deposits or general deposit runoff 
however  the company has the ability to raise deposits by conducting deposit promotions 
in the event the company requires funds beyond its ability to generate them internally  the company could obtain additional advances from the fhlb 
the company could also obtain funds through the sale of investment securities from its available for sale portfolio 
market risk management the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates will impact both the level of interest income and interest expense and the market value of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the primary goal of the company s asset liability management strategy is to maximize its net interest income over time while keeping interest rate risk exposure within levels established by the company s management 
the company s ability to manage its interest rate risk depends generally on the company s ability to match the maturities and repricing characteristics of its assets and liabilities while taking into account the separate goals of maintaining asset quality and liquidity and achieving the desired level of net interest income 
the principal variables that affect the company s management of its interest rate risk include the company s existing interest rate gap position  management s assessment of future interest rates  the need for the company to replace assets that may prepay before their scheduled maturities  and the withdrawal of liabilities over time 
the company s primary technique for managing its interest rate risk exposure is the management of the company s interest sensitivity gap 
the interest sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets anticipated  based upon certain assumptions  to mature or reprice within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities anticipated  based upon certain assumptions  to mature or reprice within that time period 
at december   the company s one year positive gap interest earning assets maturing within a period exceed interest bearing liabilities repricing within the same period was approximately million  or of total assets 
thus  during periods of rising interest rates  this implies that the company s net interest income would be positively affected because the yield of the company s interest earning assets is likely to rise more quickly than the cost on its interest bearing liabilities 
in periods of falling interest rates  the opposite effect on net interest income is likely to occur 
the company manages its interest rate risk by influencing the adjustable and fixed rate mix of its loans  securities  deposits and borrowings 
the company can add loans or securities with adjustable  balloon or call features  as well as fixed rate loans and mortgage securities if the yield on such loans and securities is consistent with the company s asset liability management strategy 
also  the company can manage its interest rate risk by extending the maturity of its borrowings or selling certain assets and repaying borrowings 
certain shortcomings are inherent in any method of analysis used to estimate a financial institution s interest rate gap 
the analysis is based at a given point in time and does not take into consideration that changes in interest rates do not affect all assets and liabilities equally 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or repricing  they may react differently to changes in market interest rates 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities also may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
the interest rates on loans with balloon or call features may or may not change depending upon their interest rates relative to market interest rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgages  have features that may restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
the company is also subject to prepayment risk  particularly in falling interest rate environments or in environments where the slope of the yield curve is relatively flat or negative 
such changes in the interest rate environment can cause substantial changes in the level of prepayments of loans and mortgage backed certificates  which may also affect the company s interest rate gap position 
as part of its borrowings  the company may utilize from time to time  convertible advances from the fhlb atlanta 
convertible advances generally provide for a fixed rate of interest for a portion of the term of the advance  an ability for the fhlb atlanta to convert the advance from a fixed rate to an adjustable rate at some predetermined time during the remaining term of the advance the conversion feature  and a concurrent opportunity for the company to prepay the advance with no prepayment penalty in the event the fhlb atlanta elects to exercise the conversion feature 
changes in interest rates from those at december  may result in a change in the estimated maturity of convertible advances and  therefore  the company s interest rate gap position 
also  the methodology used estimates various rates of withdrawal or decay for money market deposit  savings  and checking accounts  which may vary significantly from actual experience 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december  that are subject to repricing or that mature in each of the future time periods shown 
the table reflects certain assumptions regarding prepayment of loans and mortgage backed certificates that are outside of actual contractual terms  and are based on the prepayment experience of the company 
additionally  loans and securities with call or balloon provisions are included in the period in which they balloon or may first be called 
except as stated above  the amount of assets and liabilities shown that reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of the asset or liability

the following table provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december   based on the information and assumptions set forth in the notes to the table 
the company had no derivative financial instruments  foreign currency exposure or trading portfolio as of december  the amounts included under each expected maturity date for loans  mortgage backed certificates  and other investments were calculated by adjusting the instrument s contractual maturity date for expectations of prepayments  as set forth in the notes to the table 
similarly  expected maturity date amounts for interest bearing core deposits were calculated based upon estimates of the period over which the deposits would be outstanding as set forth in the notes 
with respect to the company s adjustable rate instruments  amounts included under each expected maturity date were measured by adjusting the instrument s contractual maturity date for expectations of prepayments  as set forth in the notes 
from a risk management perspective  however  the company believes that repricing dates  as opposed to expected maturity dates  may be more relevant in analyzing the interest sensitivity of such instruments

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
impact of new accounting standards in june  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 reporting comprehensive income fas  was issued and establishes standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive income and its components 
fas requires comprehensive income and its components  as recognized under the accounting standards  to be displayed in a financial statement with the same prominence as other financial statements 
the company plans to adopt the standard  as required  beginning in  adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the company 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  also issued in june  establishes new standards for reporting information about operating segments in annual and interim financial statements 
the standard also requires descriptive information about the determination of operating segments  the products and services provided by the segments and the nature of differences between reportable segment measurements and those used for the consolidated enterprise 
this standard is effective for years beginning after december  adoption in interim financial statements is not required until the year after initial adoption  however  comparative prior period information is required 
the company is evaluating the standard and plans adoption as required in  adoption is not expected to have a significant financial impact on the company 
impact of the year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  such computer programs will not recognize the correct date after december  in  the company implemented a process of software inventory  analysis  modification and testing to address the year issue 
this process is currently underway and the company expects to substantially complete its year software conversion project by the end of based on its most recent assessment  management of the company believes that modification of the company s software will be completed in a timely manner for its computer systems to properly utilize dates beyond december  the company estimates that the cost to modify its computer systems will be between  and  these costs will not be incremental costs to the company  but rather will represent the redeployment of existing information technology resources 
the potential impact of the year issue will depend not only on the corrective measures the company will undertake but also on other entities who provide data to or receive data from the company and on those whose operational capability or financial condition are important to the company  including the company s borrowers  lenders  suppliers and service providers 
the company has communicated with some of these parties to ensure their awareness of the year issue 
the plans of such parties to address the year issue will be monitored  and any fundamental impact on the company will be evaluated 
at this time  however  the company is not able to determine whether the failure to address the year issue by any of its borrowers  lenders  suppliers or service providers will affect the company s operations or financial condition
