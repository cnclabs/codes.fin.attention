the company believes that the hotels it acquires will generally experience increases in revenues and accordingly  provide the company with increases in participating lease revenues following the completion of the renovation and conversion process  however  as individual hotels undergo such renovations  their performance has been  and is expected to continue to be  adversely affected by such temporary factors as rooms out of service and disruptions of hotel operations 
a more detailed discussion of hotel revenue is contained in the lessee actual section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
actual for the period from july  inception of operations through december  the company earned  in participating lease revenue from agh leasing

the company considers funds from operations to be a key measure of the performance of an equity reit 
funds from operations should not be considered an alternative to net income or other measurements under generally accepted accounting principles as an indicator of operating performance  or an alternative to cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities  as a measure of liquidity 
the following is a reconciliation of pro forma net income applicable to common stockholders to pro forma funds from operations and illustrates the difference in the two measures of operating performance december  december  pro forma net income applicable to common stockholders   depreciation company share   funds from operations   weighted average number of basic shares of common stock outstanding   weighted average number of diluted shares of common stock outstanding   agh leasing agh leasing refers to the consolidated operations of agh leasing  lp and twin towers leasing

the margins  which are adjusted on a quarterly basis  range from a minimum of per annum to a maximum of per annum  based upon certain leverage ratios

pursuant to the merger agreement  capstar will spin off the spin off in a taxable transaction  its hotel operations and management business to its current stockholders as a new c corporation to be called meristar hotels resorts  inc meristar resorts 
capstar will subsequently merge with and into the company  which will qualify as a reorganization under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
the company will be renamed meristar hospitality corporation if the proposed merger is consummated 
in a separate transaction  which will close immediately after the closing of the proposed merger  meristar resorts will acquire agh leasing and aghi which acquisition is a condition to closing the proposed merger 
if the proposed merger is consummated  meristar resorts will become the lessee and manager of all of the current hotels currently leased by agh leasing and will have a right of first refusal to become the lessee of hotels acquired by the company in the future except for the prime group ii acquisition hotels

the company expects the proposed merger to close in june the proposed merger will be submitted for approval at separate meetings of the stockholders of the company and capstar 
prior to such stockholder meetings  the company will file a registration statement with the sec registering under the securities act of  as amended  the shares of meristar hospitality corporation to be issued in the proposed merger 
renovations and other capital improvements the participating leases require the company to establish annual minimum reserves equal to of total revenue of the current hotels which will be utilized by the lessee for the replacement and refurbishment of ff e and other capital expenditures to enhance the competitive position of the current hotels 
the company and the lessee will jointly determine the use of funds in this reserve  and the company will have the right to approve the lessee s capital expenditure budgets 
while the company expects its reserve to be adequate to fund recurring capital needs  the company expects to use cash available for distribution in excess of distributions paid or funds drawn under the new credit facilities or other borrowings or equity to fund additional capital improvements  as necessary  including major renovations at the company s hotels 
the company has budgeted million to fund capital improvements and renovations at the current hotels 
as of december   the company had invested approximately million on capital improvements and renovations and has budgeted to invest the remaining million on the current hotels in and in certain circumstances such capital improvements are being completed in connection with franchisor requirements 
the company has also budgeted approximately million to be invested in the acquisition hotels and the proposed acquisition hotels 
the amounts are budgeted to be expended during  and the company intends to use borrowings under the new credit facilities and the ff e reserve established under the participating leases to fund these expenditures 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete the scheduled capital improvements within the expected time frames or that the anticipated costs for the capital improvements will not exceed the amounts budgeted for that purpose 
changes in the scope of the work are inherent in large renovation projects such as the ones undertaken by the company 
the company has increased the scope of the work in certain projects in response to market conditions  building code  franchisor and other requirements 
the company attempts to schedule renovations and improvements during traditionally lower occupancy periods in an effort to minimize disruption to the hotels operations  however  the impact of rooms out of service and public area construction remains significant 
as individual hotels undergo such renovation and capital improvements  their performance may be adversely affected  although such effects are expected to be temporary 
inflation operators of hotels  in general  possess the ability to adjust room rates quickly 
competitive pressures may  however  limit the lessee s ability to raise room rates at the rate of inflation 
seasonality the hotel industry is seasonal in nature 
generally  hotel revenue is greater in the second and third quarters of a calendar year  although this may not be true for hotels in major tourist destinations 
with the company s acquisition of the fsa portfolio acquisition hotels  the company s portfolio may now produce greater revenues in the first and second quarters 
seasonal variations in revenue at the hotels may cause quarterly fluctuations in the company s lease revenue 
to the extent that cash flow from operations may be insufficient during any quarter to pay distributions at its current distribution rate due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in lease revenues  the company expects to utilize other cash on hand or borrowings under the new credit facilities to make such distributions 
risks relating to year issue many existing computer programs were designed and developed without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century 
the problem exists when a computer program uses only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
extensive problems can result to a company s business  requiring substantial resources to remedy 
the company believes that the year problem is not material to the company s business and operations 
although the company is addressing the problem with respect to its business operations  there can be no assurance that the year problem will be properly or timely resolved  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and  in turn  cash available for distribution
