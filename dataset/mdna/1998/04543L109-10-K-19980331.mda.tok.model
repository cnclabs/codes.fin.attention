the following discussion highlights some of these risks and others are discussed elsewhere herein or in other documents filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission 
anticipated operating losses of new residences 
the company anticipates that each residence will have an operating loss prior to depreciation  rent or interest  if any of  during the first three to four months of operation 
to the extent the company sells a residence and leases it back or otherwise finances it  the aggregate loss may increase by up to an additional  the company currently plans to open to residences in the company estimates that the losses to be incurred during due to start up residences could range from million to million 
the success of the company s future operations is directly tied to the expansion of its operational base 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience unforeseen expenses  difficulties  complications and delays in connection with the expansion of its operational base which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in april  in order to mitigate the impact of start up losses associated with the opening of newly constructed residences  the company entered into a joint venture agreement with a third party investor to operate certain new assisted living residences owned and developed by the company 
pursuant to the joint venture agreement  the company has acquired a interest for  and the joint venture partner has acquired a interest for million in the joint venture 
the joint venture concurrently entered into a non cancelable management agreement with the company pursuant to which the company will manage the properties operated by the joint venture for an amount equal to the greater of of gross revenues or  per month per property 
as of december   residences owned or leased by the company were being operated by the joint venture 
the revenues and expenses of the joint venture are consolidated with those of the company 
in addition  the company will recognize of the losses or profits  if any  of the joint venture  net of the effect of management fees paid to the company 
the company may seek to acquire the joint venture partner s interest in the future  but has no contractual right to purchase such interest 
while the use of such joint venture agreements is intended to mitigate the impact on the company of start up losses associated the opening of new residences or otherwise  the company may  to the extent it does not acquire the partner s interest  forgo a portion of future operating profits  if any  from the residences operated by the joint venture 
the company expects it will  from time to time  enter into additional partnering arrangements  which may be similar to the current structure  for some of its future development projects 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to enter into any such future arrangements or  if entered into  that such arrangements will achieve the desired results 
due to the completion of the common stock and convertible subordinated debenture offerings in october of and the completion of the acquisitions of carriage house and hci  the company expects to retain ownership of a greater number of its assisted living residences as well as to accelerate its development program 
historically  the company has relied extensively on sale leaseback financings from reits to finance its development efforts 
the company also expects to make additional investments in its management infrastructure to further support its growth strategy 
while the company believes that the resulting effects of the recent completed offerings  the increased focus on asset ownership  its accelerated development program and anticipated additions to its corporate infrastructure will negatively impact its earnings prospects over the next to months  it believes that these measures will positively affect its long term prospects 
no assurance as to ability to develop or acquire additional assisted living residences 
the company s prospects for growth are directly affected by its ability to develop and  to a lesser extent  acquire additional assisted living residences 
while the company currently plans to open to residences in  there can be no assurance that such residences will be completed 
the success of the company s growth strategy will also depend upon  among other factors  the company s ability to obtain government licenses and approvals  the company s ability to obtain financing and the competitive environment for development and acquisitions 
the nature of such licenses and approvals and the timing and likelihood of obtaining them vary widely from state to state  depending upon the residence  or its operation  and the type of services to be provided 
the successful development of additional assisted living residences will involve a number of risks  including the possibility that the company may be unable to locate suitable sites at acceptable prices or may be unable to obtain  or may experience delays in obtaining  necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy  and other required governmental permits and authorizations 
the company is dependent upon these permits and authorizations to construct and operate its residences and any delay or inability to obtain such permits could adversely affect the results of operations 
the company may also incur construction costs that exceed original estimates  may not complete construction projects on schedule and may experience competition in the search for suitable development sites 
the company relies on third party general contractors to construct its new assisted living facilities 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience difficulties in working with general contractors and subcontractors  which could result in increased construction costs and delays 
further  facility development is subject to a number of contingencies over which the company will have little control and that may adversely affect project cost and completion time  including shortages of  or the inability to obtain  labor or materials  the inability of the general contractor or subcontractors to perform under their contracts  strikes  adverse weather conditions and changes in applicable laws or regulations or in the method of applying such laws and regulations 
accordingly  if the company is unable to achieve its development plans  its business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing or acquiring any particular residence  that the company s rapid expansion will not adversely affect its operations or that any residence developed or acquired by the company will be successful 
the various risks associated with the company s development or acquisition of assisted living residences and uncertainties regarding the profitability of such operations could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
need for additional financing to fund future development and acquisitions 
to achieve its growth objectives  the company will need to obtain sufficient financial resources to fund its development  construction and acquisition activities 
the estimated cost to complete and fund start up losses for new facilities that will be developed during is between million and million  accordingly  the company s future growth will depend on its ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms 
the company will  from time to time  seek additional funding through public and or private financing sources  including equity and or debt financing 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  the company s stockholders may experience dilution 
there can be no assurance that adequate funding will be available as needed or on terms acceptable to the company 
a lack of available funds may require the company to delay or eliminate all or some of its development projects and acquisition plans 
the company s aggregate annual fixed debt and lease payment obligations as of february  totaled approximately million 
these fixed payment obligations will significantly increase as the company pursues its development plan 
failure to meet these obligations may result in the company being in default of its financing agreements and  as a consequence  the company may lose its ability to operate any individual residence or other residences which may be cross defaulted 
there can no assurance that the company will generate sufficient cash flow to meet its current or future obligations 
the company has not historically covered its fixed charges with earnings 
in addition  the company anticipates  there is a risk that  upon completion of construction  permanent financing for newly developed residences may not be available or may be available only on terms that are unfavorable or unacceptable to the company 
geographic concentration  dependence on state medicaid waiver programs 
as of december   of the company s properties are in texas  are in oregon  in ohio and in washington  therefore  the company is dependent on the economies of texas  oregon  ohio and washington and  to a certain extent  on the continued funding of state medicaid waiver programs 
during the year ended december   and  direct payments received from state medicaid agencies accounted for approximately   and  respectively of the company s revenue while the tenant paid portion of medicaid residents accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of the company s revenue during these periods 
the company expects that state medicaid reimbursement programs will constitute a significant source of revenue for the company in the future 
the company intends to continue developing and operating assisted living residences in other states 
adverse changes in general economic factors affecting these states respective health care industries or in these states laws and regulatory environment  including medicaid reimbursement rates  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on reimbursement by third party payors 
a portion of the company s revenues will be dependent upon reimbursement from third party payors  including state medicaid programs and private insurers 
for the years ended december   and  the company received  as a percentage of total revenue  under medicaid programs   and  respectively 
furthermore  there can be no assurance the company s proportionate percentage of revenue received from medicaid programs will not increase 
the revenues and profitability of the company will be affected by the continuing efforts of governmental and private third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care by attempting to lower reimbursement rates  increasing case management review of services and negotiating reduced contract pricing 
in an attempt to reduce the federal and certain state budget deficits  there have been  and management expects that there will continue to be  a number of proposals to limit medicaid reimbursement in general 
adoption of any such proposals at either the federal or the state level could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
government regulation 
federal and state governments regulate various aspects of the company s business 
the development and operation of assisted living facilities and the provision of health care services are subject to federal  state and local licensure  certification and inspection laws that regulate  among other matters  the number of licensed beds  the provision of services  equipment  staffing including professional licensing  operating policies and procedures  fire prevention measures  environmental matters  resident characteristics  physical design and compliance with building and safety codes 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in the denial of reimbursement  the imposition of fines  suspension or decertification from the medicare and medicaid program and  in extreme cases  the revocation of a facility s license or closure of a facility 
there can be no assurance that federal  state  or local governments will not impose additional restrictions on the company s activities that could materially adversely affect the company 
state and local laws regulating the company s operations vary significantly from one jurisdiction to another 
in certain states in which the company is currently developing assisted living facilities  a certificate of need or other similar approval may be required for the acquisition or construction of new facilities  the expansion of the number of licensed units or beds or services  or the opening of a home health care agency or hospice 
the company could be adversely affected by the failure or inability to obtain such approval  changes in the standards applicable for such approval and possible delays and expenses associated with obtaining such approval 
federal and state fraud and abuse laws  such as anti kickback laws and self referral laws  govern certain financial arrangements among health care providers and others who may be in a position to refer or recommend patients to such providers 
although the company has established policies and procedures that it believes are sufficient to ensure that its facilities will operate in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements  there can be no assurance that such fraud and abuse laws will be interpreted in a manner consistent with the practices of the company 
pricing pressures 
the health care services industry is currently experiencing market driven reforms from forces within and outside the industry that are exerting pressure on health care and related companies to reduce health care costs 
these market driven reforms are resulting in industry wide consolidation that is expected to increase the downward pressure on health care service providers margins  as larger buyer and supplier groups exert pricing pressure on health care providers 
the ultimate timing or effect of market driven reforms cannot be predicted 
no assurance can be given that any such reforms will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  financial condition and prospects 
health care reform 
health care and related services is an area of extensive and dynamic regulatory change 
changes in the law  new interpretations of existing laws  or changes in payment methodology  may have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or impermissible activities  the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of reimbursement by both government and other third party payors and may be applied retroactively 
in addition  to the reforms enacted and considered by congress from time to time  state legislatures periodically consider various health care reform proposals 
congress and state legislatures can be expected to continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery systems and payment methodologies and public debate of these issues can be expected to continue in the future 
the ultimate timing or effect of legislative efforts cannot be predicted and may impact the company in different ways 
there can be no assurances that either the states or the federal government will not impose additional regulations upon the activities of the company or hci which might adversely affect their businesses  the financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
staffing and labor costs 
the company will compete with other providers of long term care with respect to attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
the company will also be dependent upon the available labor pool of low wage employees 
a shortage of nurses and or trained personnel may require the company to enhance its wage and benefits package in order to compete 
no assurance can be given that the company s labor costs will not increase  or that  if they do increase  they can be matched by corresponding increases in revenues 
competition 
the long term care industry is highly competitive and the company expects that the assisted living business  in particular  will become more competitive in the future 
the company will be competing with numerous other companies providing similar long term care alternatives  such as home health agencies  life care at home  community based service programs  retirement communities and convalescent centers 
the company expects that as assisted living receives increased attention and the number of states which include assisted living in their medicaid waiver programs increases  competition will grow from new markets entrants  including publicly and privately held companies focusing primarily on assisted living 
nursing facilities that provide long term care services are also a source of competition to the company 
moreover  in the implementation of the company s expansion program  the company expects to face competition for development and acquisitions of assisted living residences 
some of the company s present and potential competitors are significantly larger and have  or may obtain  greater financial resources than those of the company 
consequently  there can be no assurance that the company will not encounter increased competition in the future which could limit its ability to attract residents or expand its business and could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
difficulties of managing rapid growth 
the company expects that the number of residences which it owns  leases or otherwise operates will increase substantially as it pursues its growth strategy 
this rapid growth will place significant demands on the company s management resources 
the company s ability to manage its growth effectively will require it to continue to expand its operational  financial and management information systems and to continue to attract  train  motivate  manage and retain key employees 
to the extent such growth is attributable to acquisitions of existing facilities or businesses  the company s success will depend partly on its ability to integrate effectively such facilities and businesses into the company s management  information and operating systems 
if the company is unable to manage its growth effectively  its business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected

liability and insurance 
the provision of health care services entails an inherent risk of liability 
in recent years  participants in the long term care industry have become subject to an increasing number of lawsuits alleging malpractice or related legal theories  many of which involve large claims and significant defense costs 
the company currently maintains liability insurance intended to cover such claims and the company believes that its insurance is in keeping with industry standards 
there can be no assurance  however  that claims in excess of the company s insurance coverage or claims not covered by the company insurance coverage eg  claims for punitive damages will not arise 
a successful claim against the company not covered by  or in excess of  the company s insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect upon the company s financial condition and results of operations 
claims against the company regardless of their merit or eventual outcome  may also have a material adverse effect upon the company s ability to attract residents or expand its business and would require management to devote time to matters unrelated to the operation of the company s business 
in addition  the company s insurance policies must be renewed annually 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain liability insurance coverage in the future or that  if such coverage is available  it will be available on acceptable terms 
environmental risks 
under various federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the cost of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances  including  without limitation  asbestos containing materials  that could be located on  in or under such property 
such laws and regulations often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances 
the costs of any required remediation or removal of these substances could be substantial and the liability of an owner or operator as to any property is generally not limited under such laws and regulations and could exceed the property s value and the aggregate assets of the owner or operator 
the presence of these substances or failure to remediate such substances properly may also adversely affect the owner s ability to sell or rent the property  or to borrow using the property as collateral 
under these laws and regulations  an owner  operator or an entity that arranges for the disposal of hazardous or toxic substances  such as asbestos containing materials  at a disposal site may also be liable for the costs of any required remediation or removal of the hazardous or toxic substances at the disposal site 
in connection with the ownership or operation of its properties  the company could be liable for these costs  as well as certain other costs  including governmental fines and injuries to persons or properties 
as a result  the presence  with or without the company s knowledge  of hazardous or toxic substances at any property held or operated by the company  or acquired or operated by the company in the future  could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
environmental audits performed on the company s properties have not revealed any significant environmental liability that management believes would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
no assurance can be given that existing environmental audits with respect to any other company s properties reveal all environmental liabilities
