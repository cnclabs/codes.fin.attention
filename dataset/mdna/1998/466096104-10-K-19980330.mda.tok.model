item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations general j 
alexander s corporation operated j 
alexander s full service  casual dining restaurants at december  during the fourth quarter of the company sold substantially all of the assets of its franchised wendy s old fashioned hamburgers restaurant operations 
the company s wendy s restaurants generated restaurant operating income of  on sales of  in  and restaurant operating income of  on sales of  in as a result of the divestiture  the company s sales and income from restaurant operations were significantly reduced in a loss of  before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was incurred in this compares to income before income taxes of  in the results included a gain from the divestiture of the wendy s division of  an additional gain of  was recorded on the divestiture in income before the wendy s gains  income taxes and cumulative effect adjustment decreased by  in compared to  a nominal increase in in restaurant operating income from j 
alexander s restaurants combined with decreases in general and administrative expenses and in net interest expense were not adequate to offset the loss of restaurant operating income resulting from the wendy s divestiture 
the company s net loss of  for included an increase of  in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and an  charge to reflect the cumulative effect of a change in the company s accounting principle for pre opening costs to expense them as incurred 
for fiscal  income before income taxes and the  gain on the wendy s divestiture was  as compared to income before income taxes of  for restaurant operating income in the j 
alexander s division increased by  or  in however  this increase was not enough to offset the combined effect of a decline of  in the wendy s division and increased general and administrative expenses  pre opening cost amortization and other expense net interest expense plus other income 
net income in included a federal income tax provision approximating the federal statutory rate  whereas net income for reflected deferred income tax benefits of  associated with the recognition of deferred tax assets for financial reporting purposes 
management reached the decision to sell the wendy s operations in because it believed that focusing all of the company s capital and resources exclusively on its casual dining business offered the greatest potential for long term return for its shareholders 
however  the divestiture is expected to continue to have a negative impact on earnings until the lost revenue and operating income from the wendy s operations can be replaced by the successful development and operation of j 
alexander s restaurants

alexander s restaurant operations the company operated j 
alexander s restaurants at december   compared with at december   and nine at december  results of the j 
alexander s restaurant operations before allocation of general and administrative expenses  pre opening costs and net interest expense were as follows years ended dollars in thousands december  december  december  amount of sales amount of sales amount of sales net sales    restaurant costs and expenses cost of sales    labor and related costs    depreciation and amortization of restaurant property and equipment    other operating expenses    restaurant operating income    total sales from j 
alexander s restaurants increased in both and compared to the prior years primarily as a result of new restaurant openings 
however  average weekly sales per restaurant decreased to  in from  in and  in as a result of lower sales from new restaurants 
same store sales and restaurant operating income  which include comparable results for all restaurants open for more than twelve months  increased in both and as compared to the prior year 
same store sales for on a base of thirteen restaurants increased by to an average of  per week from  in for this same group of restaurants  restaurant operating income as a percentage of sales increased to from 
same store sales for averaged  per week on a base of eight restaurants  a increase over  for operating margins for this group of restaurants improved to in from in j 
alexander s overall financial performance has been significantly affected by the number of new restaurants opened during the last three years during which the number of restaurants increased from five to in order to maximize the quality of guest service and successfully complete the extensive training and support of j 
alexander s staff  there is typically little or no advertising or promotion of new j 
alexander s restaurant openings 
management believes that this quiet opening approach enhances guest experiences and contributes significantly to increases in sales over a long period of time 
however  because this approach often results in slow sales growth until a new restaurant s reputation grows and because of the expenses associated with the company s emphasis on training and quality of operations during the opening months of operation  the financial performance of newer restaurants typically trails that of more mature restaurants and the company expects newly opened restaurants to experience operating losses in their initial months of operation 
in addition  some of the company s newer restaurants have not experienced the increases in sales expected by management  thus compounding the effect of these new restaurants on financial performance 
restaurant operating income as a percentage of sales decreased in as compared to and in as compared to as a result of these effects 
to illustrate the effects of new restaurants on results of operations  losses incurred at the restaurant level in the year of opening totaled approximately  for the four restaurants opened in and  for the five restaurants opened in the four restaurants opened in operated at approximately a breakeven level on this basis 
generally results in the company s restaurants improve significantly after their first full year of operations 
largely due to the effects of new restaurant openings  all categories of costs and expenses  with the exception of cost of sales  increased as a percentage of sales in as compared to and in as compared to cost of sales  which includes food and alcoholic beverage costs  decreased as a percentage of sales in both and as compared to the prior years due primarily to management emphasis on cost controls in this area 
also  this expense category is less sensitive to the effect of lower sales volumes than the other categories which have large fixed components 
of the restaurants which had been open for at least one full year at december   management considers eight of them to be at acceptable sales levels which averaged  per restaurant per week in the remaining six restaurants  three of which were opened in and three in  are below sales levels which management considers acceptable and averaged  per week in in order to meet the company s long term profitability objectives  all j 
alexander s restaurants need to reach or exceed approximately the level of sales of the eight restaurants discussed above 
all of the company s under performing restaurants discussed above currently have positive sales trends and management believes that all or virtually all of the company s restaurants have the potential over time to reach satisfactory sales levels 
because the breakeven point for j 
alexander s is relatively high due to the high fixed costs necessary to deliver and sustain the high levels of food quality  service and ambiance which are critical components of the j 
alexander s concept  management believes that the primary issue faced by the company in returning it to profitability is the improvement of sales in several of its restaurants  particularly its newer restaurants 
in guest service support was increased in some of the company s newer restaurants in order to ensure the highest quality of operations 
additionally menu prices were reduced in some of the restaurants which were not posting satisfactory guest count increases 
while these strategies increased the company s losses for  guest counts to date have increased significantly in these restaurants 
in march of the company increased menu prices in all of its restaurants by an average of approximately 
some additional  but smaller  menu price increases are planned for the summer of other actions which should improve results include the implementation of operational systems designed to provide quicker service and increase table turns and the negotiation of national contracts for purchase of certain of the company s food items 
the company has lowered its development plans for and to two restaurants to allow management to focus intently on improving sales and profits in its existing restaurants while maintaining operational excellence 
the lower expansion rate will also reduce start up related expenses 
management remains optimistic about the long term prospects for j 
alexander s 
it believes that actions taken in and the recent menu price increase will have a positive impact on financial performance for however  only modest improvements are expected in the first quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of as the price increase was not implemented until late in the first quarter 
further improvements are expected throughout the remainder of  however  based on its current assessment of the company s business  management does not believe the company will be profitable before the fourth quarter of wendy s restaurant operations results of the company s wendy s restaurant operations before allocation of general and administrative expenses  pre opening costs and net interest expense are set forth in the following table 
results for include the period through november  years ended dollars in thousands december  december  amount of sales amount of sales net sales   restaurant costs and expenses cost of sales   labor and related costs   depreciation and amortization of restaurant property and equipment   royalties   other operating expenses   restaurant operating income   in november  the company sold of its wendy s old fashioned hamburgers restaurants to wendy s international  inc for million in cash plus the assumption of capitalized lease obligations and the long term debt totaling approximately million 
the remaining six restaurants have been sold or closed 
the company operated wendy s restaurants at december  total wendy s sales decreased by  or  in compared to  due primarily to the sale referenced in the preceding paragraph 
weighted average sales per unit decreased by in competition in the quick service restaurant industry in general and intense retail price competition by other major hamburger chains  combined with the continued development of new wendy s restaurants by other franchisees in certain of the company s market areas  were significant factors in management s decision to divest its wendy s business 
as a percentage of sales  restaurant operating income in the wendy s division decreased to in from in  as increases in cost of sales  labor and other operating expenses more than offset a decrease in depreciation expense 
under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  no depreciation or amortization expense related to the wendy s assets held for disposal was recorded during the last half of general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses  which include management training costs and all other costs above the restaurant level for j 
alexander s and  before  wendy s operations  decreased by  or  in compared to due to the disposition of the wendy s operations 
as expected  however  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales to in from in  because these expenses did not decrease in proportion to the reduction in revenues resulting from the wendy s divestiture  a large portion of these costs is related to the operation and development of j 
alexander s restaurants 
general and administrative expenses are expected to decrease as a percentage of sales in as compared to due to the higher sales levels for the company resulting from new j 
alexander s restaurants opened in and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to in from in due to the higher total sales level for the company 
pre opening expense in the company changed its accounting policy to expense all pre opening costs as incurred rather than deferring and amortizing them over a period of twelve months from each restaurant s opening 
this change resulted in a charge of  to record the cumulative effect as of the beginning of in the company changed its amortization period for pre opening costs from twenty four months to twelve months 
due to the change in accounting principle and the lowering of the company s development rate to two restaurants for  pre opening expenses  which management estimates will be approximately  per restaurant  should be significantly less in than in  both in terms of the dollar amount and as a percentage of sales 
interest income and expense interest expense decreased by  in compared to due to the elimination of long term obligations associated with the company s wendy s restaurant operations and a reduction in average balances outstanding under the company s line of credit as a result of the use of a portion of the proceeds from the wendy s divestiture to retire the outstanding balance at that time and to fund a portion of the company s capital needs for interest expense increased by  in compared to  as interest related to borrowings under the company s line of credit more than offset an increase in interest expense capitalized in connection with new restaurant development 
interest income increased by  in compared to due to increased investment balances resulting from the wendy s divestiture 
interest income decreased by  in compared to primarily due to lower investment balances resulting from the development of new restaurants 
income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  the company had gross deferred tax assets of  and  and gross deferred tax liabilities of  and  at december  and december   respectively 
the deferred tax assets at december  relate primarily to  of net operating loss carryforwards and  of tax credit carryforwards available to reduce future federal income taxes 
the recognition of deferred tax assets depends on the likelihood of taxable income in future periods in amounts sufficient to realize the assets 
the deferred tax assets must be reduced to the extent future income is not likely to be generated 
in  management concluded that future taxable income should be sufficient to realize all of the company s deferred tax assets and reduced the beginning of the year valuation allowance by  of which  was credited to additional paid in capital 
no allowance was deemed necessary during and earnings for the year were taxed at an effective rate of 
due to the loss incurred in and because the company operates with a high degree of financial and operating leverage  with a significant portion of operating costs being fixed or semi fixed in nature  management was unable to conclude that it was more likely than not that its existing deferred tax assets would be realized and in the fourth quarter of increased the beginning of the year valuation allowance for these assets by  at december   the company has recorded a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of  approximately million of future taxable income would be needed to realize the company s tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards at december  these carryforwards expire in the years through approximately  of taxable income would be needed to realize the carryforwards which expire in and  to use those which expire in liquidity and capital resources the company s primary need for capital has historically been and is expected to continue to be capital expenditures for the development of new restaurants 
capital expenditures totaled   and  for  and  respectively  and were primarily for the development of new j 
alexander s restaurants 
also included in these amounts were capital expenditures for the wendy s division of  for and  for which included facilities upgrades and miscellaneous equipment replacements as well as the development of three new restaurants in the company s capital expenditures for new restaurants have significantly exceeded the cash flow generated from operations for the last three years  with the difference being funded primarily by the use of funds on hand at the beginning of  proceeds from the sale of the company s wendy s operations in and use of the company s bank line of credit 
the company plans to continue to develop new j 
alexander s restaurants  but at a reduced rate  at least for the present 
two restaurants  both of which will be on leased land  will be opened in and a like number is tentatively planned for the average cost of constructing a j 
alexander s building in was approximately  a lower cost building  which is expected to cost approximately  has been developed by the company for use in selected markets 
the first of these buildings is under construction and will open in the cost of equipping a j 
alexander s restaurant is approximately  to  the principal variable in the cost of a restaurant is the decision of whether to own or lease a restaurant site and  if the decision is to own  the cost of land in the particular market 
in general  the company prefers to own its sites because of the long term value of owning the assets 
for restaurants opened during  the cost of land ranged from  to  in addition  site preparation and improvement costs are expected to range from approximately  to  per restaurant 
management estimates that total capital expenditures for the company for will be million to million  the variance depending primarily on the amount  if any  spent for restaurants to be opened in in the company utilized most of its cash and cash equivalents on hand at the beginning of the year and a portion of its line of credit for the development of new restaurants 
the use of substantial amounts of cash and cash equivalents for new restaurant development in resulted in a working capital deficit of  at december  in the company had a cash flow deficit from operations of  primarily resulting from payment of accrued expenses associated with the wendy s operations and the results of operations of the company s j 
alexander s restaurants 
the company does not believe that this deficit impairs the overall financial condition of the company because it expects cash flow from operations to improve as its results from operations improve and to be adequate to meet current obligations  including a scheduled sinking fund payment of  in on its convertible subordinated debentures 
certain of the company s expenses  particularly depreciation and amortization  do not require current outlays of cash 
also  requirements for funding accounts receivable and inventories are relatively insignificant  thus virtually all cash generated by operations is available to meet current obligations 
the company maintains a bank line of credit which is expected to be used as the company s primary means for funding of capital expenditures in and and which will also provide liquidity for meeting working capital or other needs 
at december   borrowings outstanding under this line of credit were  as a result of the reduction in the company s plans for new restaurant development  the company s loan agreement was amended in march of to reduce the commitment amount from million to million 
in addition  because the company would not have complied with one of the covenants in the credit agreement  that covenant was deleted 
in its place  the company and the bank lender agreed on certain new covenants which require the company to achieve specified results of operations and specified levels of ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization to senior debt 
based on the company s current assessment of its business  the company believes it will comply with those new covenants 
the amendments to the credit agreement contain certain limitations on capital expenditures and restaurant development by the company generally limiting the company to the development of two new restaurants per year and restrict the company s ability to incur additional debt outside the bank line of credit 
the interest rate on borrowings under the line of credit following the execution of the amendment will be libor plus three percent 
the line of credit was extended through july  and includes an option to convert outstanding borrowings to a term loan at that time 
the company believes that amounts available for borrowing under the line of credit will be sufficient to fund the development of j 
alexander s restaurants for and impact of accounting changes there are no pending accounting pronouncements that  when adopted  are expected to have a material effect on the company s results of operations or its financial condition 
impact of the year issue the company has completed an initial assessment of its year information systems compliance issues and is in the process of implementing a plan to deal with these issues 
since most of the company s internal computer applications have been recently developed or upgraded and none are main frame driven  management believes that they generally are or will be year compliant 
the company does not expect that the cost of year compliance issues will have a material impact on its results of operations 
impact of inflation and other factors virtually all of the company s costs and expenses are subject to normal inflationary pressures and the company is continually seeking ways to cope with their impact 
by owning a number of its properties  the company avoids certain increases in occupancy costs 
new and replacement assets will likely be acquired at higher costs but this will take place over many years 
in general  the company tries to offset increased costs and expenses through additional improvements in operating efficiencies and by increasing menu prices over time  as permitted by competition and market conditions
