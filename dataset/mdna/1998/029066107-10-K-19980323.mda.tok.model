the company competes  and will continue to compete  with several us and foreign firms with respect to ups products  both on a worldwide basis and in various geographical regions  and within individual ups product and application niches 
the company expects competition to increase in the future from existing competitors and a number of companies which may enter the company s existing or future markets 
increased competition could adversely affect the company s revenue and profitability through price reductions and loss of market share 
the principal competitive factors in the ups industry are product performance and quality  marketing and access to distribution channels  customer services  product design and price 
some of the company s current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  sales and marketing resources than the company

moreover  in the absence of patent protection  the company s business may be adversely affected by competitors that independently develop functionally equivalent technology

possible volatility of stock price the market price of the company s common stock has been  and may continue to be  extremely volatile 
the trading price of the company s common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  challenges associated with integration of businesses and other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have particularly affected the market price for many high technology companies and which often have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
tax rate the company s tax rate is heavily dependent upon the proportion of earnings that are derived from its ireland and philippines manufacturing operations and its ability to reinvest those earnings permanently outside the united states 
if the earnings of these operations as a percentage of the company s total earnings were to decline significantly from anticipated levels  or should its ability to reinvest these earnings be reduced  the company s effective tax rate would exceed the currently estimated rate for in addition  should the company s intercompany transfer pricing with respect to its ireland or philippine manufacturing operations require significant adjustment due to audits or regulatory changes  the company s overall effective tax rate could increase
