as of september    and  the company has borrowed   and  respectively under the note 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a significant amount of the advances from wsi have historically been non interest bearing  some of which was ultimately converted to equity  interest expense in and has increased significantly as a result of the advances made pursuant to the interest bearing note

operating activities the company has continued to experience a cash loss from operations during fiscal the company anticipates an improvement of its working cash from operations for fiscal and will be dependent upon wsi to fund its continued operations 
however  no assurance can be given that wsi will continue to advance funds to the company

in fiscal  the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for the long lived assets to be disposed of sfas no 
requires impairment losses to be recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount

the increase in accounts receivable from to results primarily from an increase sales and from a delay in the billing cycle due to the relocation of the company s production accounting office during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year end the decrease in accounts receivable from to results primarily from providing a significant allowance for doubtful accounts and aggressive cash collections partially offset by increased billings during the year 
the increase in accounts receivable from to results primarily from the acquisition of med waste and merger of ci and a delay in billings related to the move from san marcus to houston and integration of the acquisitions 
the increase in accounts payable from to is primarily a result of the decreased operating capital available to make payments on a timely basis 
the decrease in accounts payable from to results primarily from the payment of outstanding obligations due to the availability of funds advanced or invested by wsi

cost of services increased to  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the increased cost of service resulted from higher transportation costs  incineration costs paid to third parties and a substantial increase in costs of supplies 
these higher costs can be partially associated with the river bay division due to the delay of the start of an incinerator in birmingham  alabama 
the incinerator was in full operation by the start of the third quarter of fiscal and some of the projected reductions in outside incinerator costs paid to third parties and the elimination of additional transportation and repackaging costs associated with the dependency for outside incineration costs are being achieved 
in addition  the installation and the startup costs associated with the microwave unit at our birmingham  alabama  created an increase in operating costs 
write off of intangible assets in fiscal totaled  the company prepared an evaluation of the fair value of the assets associated with the company s operations resulting in the determination that certain intangible assets were impaired 
the fair value was based on estimated future cash flows to be generated by the company s operations  discounted at a market rate of interest 
this write off of intangibles was a result of the company consistently experiencing and further projecting negative cash flows 
due to ci current operating and cash flow losses  combined with the company s history of operating and cash flow losses and the current forecast of continued losses of both operating and cash flow for the fiscal year ended september   it was necessary that the company perform tests for the potential impairment to long lived assets as outline in sfas recognition and impairment 
because of the above circumstances  the company estimated its future cash flows to be generated by its assets less the future cash outflows expected to be necessary to obtain those cash inflows 
in the preparing the analysis  the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges was less than the carrying amount of the company s intangible assets  and the company recognized an impairment loss in accordance with sfas of its intangible assets of  in estimating the expected future cash flows for determining whether the assets were impaired and if expected future cash flows sre used in measuring assets that are impaired  the assets grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows as noted above the company broke down the assets into divisions 
the estimates used for expected future cash flows were based on the company forecast for the fiscal year ended september  also  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company s majority shareholder indicated that they were no longer willing to commit to fund the company on a long term basis 
this event along with the fiscal budget of continued losses indicated that an impairment should be recognized 
the impaired assets are incineration rights  goodwill and customer lists as recorded on ci and river bay division accounting records at september  this write down is a result of the company suffering historical operating and cash flow losses with continued forecast operating and cash flow losses for the current fiscal year

during  the company made a decision to terminate the lease agreement early due to the high cost of maintenance of the leased transportation equipment 
the company had also  capitalized other costs associated with these leased assets which when the lease was terminated the company wrote off the remaining net book value 
as the transportation equipment was returned it was necessary to write the remaining capitalized net book value off of  reusable containers  in  the company made an operational decision to move a portion of their customer base from disposable cardboard boxes to reusable plastic containers 
a significant investment was then made in reusable plastic containers and based upon it s prior operating experience with the reusable containers  the company estimated that a three year life was more reflective of the reusable containers than a five year life 
in previous periods the company had estimated that the life of reusable containers was years 
due to this change in estimate the company wrote off previously capitalized reusable containers with a net book value of  machinery equipment  during fiscal  it was necessary to change out the bags inside the scrubber at incinerator as these bags became excessively worn and the integrity of the bags were beginning to deteriorate 
these bags had a remaining net book value of  that were written off as they were no longer able to remain in service

computer software  during and  the company  began capitalizing cost associated with a proven technology of a bar coding systems and an accounting system that would streamline the paperwork from the transportation locations to the incinerators to ultimately the accounting department production billing accounting system 
this was put into service in fiscal and was being amortized

the write off of these capitalized costs totaled  the company also wrote off previously capitalized accounting software with a remaining net book value of  that was acquired in a previous acquisition river bay asset acquisition as this software was abandoned when the river bay division was integrated in the fourth quarter of into the ci accounting system

cost of services increased to  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the increased cost of service resulted from higher transportation costs  incineration costs paid to third parties and a substantial increase in costs of supplies 
the acquisition of river bay in fiscal was a strategic entry into a new major market region and costs per pound have been higher 
management believes that the construction of a strategically located incineration facility  scheduled for completion in the second quarter of fiscal  should reduce the cost of services for that region 
additionally  the cost of supplies  primarily boxes and liners increased substantially as a result of increased prices of paperboard and resin  resulting in higher cost per revenue dollar 
the company was not able to pass all these cost increases on to its customers due to ongoing competitive pricing pressures
