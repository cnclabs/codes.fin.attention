the company expects capital expenditures in will remain flat when compared to the company generated  of cash from financing activities in compared to a use of  in and generation of  of cash from investing activities in cash generated in primarily resulted from the exercise of stock options 
the company has a  credit facility the credit facility which may be used for working capital  acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
the credit facility bears interest at the prime rate of the lending banks  but is adjustable to a maximum rate of above the prime rate in the event the company s ratio of debt to cash flow exceeds a defined ratio 
a libor based interest rate option is also provided 
as of december  there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the company s personal property 
pursuant to sales and marketing agreements with ibm  the company has agreed to purchase a minimum number of ibm manufactured atomic force microscopes sxm products  one of which is in the development phase  for sale by the company to customers in the semiconductor and data storage industries

the company believes that the cash generated from operations  funds available from the credit facility described above and existing cash balances will be sufficient to meet the company s projected working capital and other cash flow requirements through risk factors that may impact future results certain information provided by the company  statements made by its employees or information included in its filings with the securities and exchange commission may contain statements which are forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
the following risk factors should be considered by shareholders of and by potential investors in the company 
cyclicality of data storage and semiconductor industries 
the data storage and semiconductor industries have been characterized by cyclicality 
these industries have experienced significant economic downturns at various times in the last decade  characterized by diminished product demand  accelerated erosion of average selling prices and production over capacity 
recently  the data storage industry has been plagued by inventory oversupply and poor operating results and the company s data storage is anticipating a weak first half of the company also sells product to companies located throughout the world 
international markets provide the company with growth opportunities along with additional risk 
many pacific rim countries are currently experiencing economic difficulties  which could result in reduced demand for the company s products from customers in this area 
the company may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future operating results due to general industry conditions or events occurring in the general economy 
rapid technological change  importance of timely product introduction 
the data storage and semiconductor manufacturing industries are subject to rapid technological change and new product introductions and enhancements 
the company s ability to remain competitive will depend in part upon its ability to develop in a timely and cost effective manner new and enhanced systems at competitive prices 
in addition  new product introductions or enhancements by the company s competitors could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of the company s existing products 
increased competitive pressure could also lead to intensified price competition resulting in lower margins  which could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the success of the company in developing  introducing and selling new and enhanced systems depends upon a variety of factors  including product selections  timely and efficient completion of product design and development  timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing processes  effective sales  service and marketing and product performance in the field 
because new product development commitments must be made well in advance of sales  new product decisions must anticipate both the future demand for the products under development and the equipment required to produce such products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in selecting  developing  manufacturing and marketing new products or in enhancing existing products 
limited sales backlog 
the company derives a substantial portion of its sales from the sale of a relatively small number of systems which typically range in purchase price from approximately  to  as a result  the timing of recognition of revenue for a single transaction could have a material adverse affect on the company s sales and operating results 
the company s backlog at the beginning of a quarter typically does not include all sales required to achieve the company s sales objective for that quarter 
moreover  all customer purchase orders are subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer with limited or no penalties 
therefore  backlog at any particular date is not necessarily representative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
the company s net sales and operating results for a quarter may depend upon the company obtaining orders for systems to be shipped in the same quarter that the order is received 
the company s business and financial results for a particular period could be materially adversely affected if an anticipated order for even one system is not received in time to permit shipping during the period 
highly competitive industry 
the data storage and semiconductor capital equipment industries are intensely competitive 
a substantial investment is required by customers to install and integrate capital equipment into a production line 
as a result  once a manufacturer has selected a particular vendor s capital equipment  the company believes that the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for the specific production line application and frequently will attempt to consolidate its other capital equipment requirements with the same vendor 
accordingly  the company expects to experience difficulty in selling to a particular customer for a significant period of time if that customer selects a competitor s capital equipment 
the company expects its competitors to continue to develop enhancements to and future generations of competitive products that may offer improved price or performance features 
new product introductions and enhancements by the company s competitors could cause a significant decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of the company s systems in addition to intense price competition or otherwise make the company s systems or technology obsolete or noncompetitive 
increased competitive pressure could lead to reduced demand and lower prices for the company s products  thereby materially adversely affecting the company s operating results 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future 
year the company has determined that it will need to modify or replace portions of its software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and beyond 
the company has recently installed a new business information system for its process equipment and industrial measurement product lines  which is year compliant 
the cost of such system was capitalized 
the company is in the process of assessing the extent of upgrades or modifications required for its process metrology product lines 
the company does not believe it has significant exposure to year with significant suppliers  large customers and financial institutions 
the company does not expect the cost of the year initiatives to be material to the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
foreign operations 
approximately   and of the company s net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively  were derived from sales denominated in foreign currencies 
the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on such revenues is largely offset to the extent expenses of the company s international operations are incurred and paid for in the same currencies as those of its revenues 
the company has mitigated its exposure to foreign currency transaction adjustments by substantially offsetting assets denominated in foreign currencies with foreign currency liabilities 
the company generally has not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions 
foreign currency translation adjustments of   and  were charged credited to shareholder s equity for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the aggregate exchange gains and losses included in determining consolidated results of operations were   and  for the years ended december   and respectively 
dependence on microelectronics industry 
the company s business depends in large part upon the capital expenditures of data storage  semiconductor and flat panel display manufacturers which accounted for the following percentages of the company s net sales years ended december  data storage semiconductor flat panel display the company cannot predict whether the growth experienced in the microelectronics industry in the recent past will continue
