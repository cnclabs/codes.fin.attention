item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition general the company is an smo managing a clinical research network comprised of over affiliated sites 
collaborative also manages three owned clinical research sites 
collaborative s revenue is derived by providing sponsors with an innovative  timely  cost effective and low risk means of selecting clinical research sites and managing clinical trials as part of the pharmaceutical product development process 
since commencing operations in  collaborative has grown through a combination of internal expansion and strategic acquisitions 
collaborative acquired two companies in  gfi and wce 
gfi conducts phase i through iv clinical research at the company s three owned clinical research sites 
wce s services include studies necessary to switch prescription drugs to otc products  label comprehension evaluations and consumer product testing 
both acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  and the consolidated results of operations include the results of operations of both businesses from their respective acquisition dates 
after allocating purchase price to the fair value of the net assets acquired  the company recorded approximately million of goodwill in connection with the acquisitions 
the company amortizes goodwill using the straight line method over a period of years 
the company s wholly owned subsidiary  datatrak  was formed in datatrak will provide certain electronic data management services  through its edc software and qrc  to improve quality  efficiency  and timeliness of the clinical research process 
the company s backlog at december  was million  as compared to backlog of million at december  backlog is composed of a number of contracts  each with a different term and duration 
as is customary  these contracts are subject to modification and or possible cancellation 
therefore  the amount of backlog is not necessarily indicative of the company s future quarterly or annual revenues 
the company has taken several steps to reorganize its sales and operating structure  however its future financial performance continues to depend on its success in bringing in new business and converting backlog into revenue 
to that end  management expects its financial performance in the first half of to continue to reflect the weaknesses experienced in the second half of  but believes the remainder of the year will begin to evidence a turn around in the company s business 
the company s clinical research service contracts generally have terms ranging from several months to several years 
a portion of the contract fee is generally payable upon execution of the contract  with the balance payable in installments over the life of the contract 
revenue and related direct costs are recognized as specific contract terms are fulfilled under the percentage of completion method utilizing units of delivery 
the company s contracts are broken down into discrete units of deliverable services for which a fixed fee for each unit is established 
pass through costs that are paid directly by the company s sponsors  and for which the company does not bear the risk of economic loss  are excluded from revenue 
these costs can include investigator meeting fees  irb fees and travel costs 
the termination of a contract results in no material adjustments to revenue or direct costs previously recognized  and the company is entitled to payment for all work performed through the date of notice of termination and all costs associated with termination of a study 
the company s contracts generally may be terminated by the sponsor with or without cause 
some of the reasons clinical trials may be terminated include unexpected results or adverse patient reactions to the drug  inadequate patient enrollment or investigator recruitment  manufacturing problems resulting in shortages of the drug or decisions by the sponsor to de emphasize or terminate a particular trial or development efforts on a particular drug 
depending on the size of the trial  a sponsor s decision to terminate or delay the trial could have a material adverse effect on the company s backlog  future revenue and profitability 
the company s quarterly results can fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including success in attracting new business  the size and duration of the clinical trials in which the company and members of its network of affiliated sites participate  the timing of sponsor decisions to conduct new clinical trials or to cancel or delay ongoing trials  the impact of acquisitions made by the company and other factors  many of which are beyond the company s control

to date  those discussions have not resulted in an acceptable resolution of these issues 
the company does not believe that it has any continuing financial obligations to ibm global services and  based on information known to date  does not believe that additional expenditures associated with the termination of this alliance  if any  will have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
in january  datatrak purchased the edc software known as opustwo from eds 
the company will be responsible for funding the future development and testing of this software  which has been renamed datatrak edc tm

in connection with this plan  the company will record a charge of approximately million in the first quarter of to recognize costs associated with employee severance and other special items 
the company anticipates that its capital expenditures for will be approximately million for its datatrak and clinical divisions 
the company s principal cash needs on both a short term and long term basis are for the funding of its operations  capital expenditure requirements  and the development of its datatrak r process and service business 
the company expects to continue expanding its operations through internal growth  joint ventures and alliances  and after its turn around has been accomplished  through strategic acquisitions 
the company expects such activities will be funded from existing cash and cash equivalents  maturities of short term investments  cash flow from operations and borrowings under its line of credit 
the company has a line of credit agreement with a bank which provides for borrowings up to million that bears interest at rates not to exceed prime no amounts are outstanding at december  
the company s accounts receivable are pledged as collateral on the line of credit 
the line of credit agreement also requires that the company maintain investments of million with the bank 
of the million line of credit  million is considered to be committed and is subject to renewal at january  the million uncommitted amount is subject to renewal at july  as the year approaches  an issue has emerged regarding how existing application software and operating systems can accommodate this date value 
the company is reviewing its systems to determine if any year problems may occur 
management does not anticipate incurring any material operating expenses or significant computer system investments to be year compliant 
however  year issues incurred by the company s affiliated sites  sponsors or other vendors and customers could indirectly affect the company 
the company believes that cash generated from operations  maturities of short term investments and amounts available under its line of credit will be sufficient to fund its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  selective acquisitions and joint ventures may play a role in the company s growth strategy 
to the extent that the company were to acquire additional research organizations  it may require additional capital 
there can be no assurance as to the company s ability to obtain additional financing 
inflation to date  the company believes the effects of inflation have not had a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition 
information about forward looking statements certain statements made in this annual report on form k  other sec filings or written materials or orally by the company or its representatives may constitute forward looking statements 
the company wishes to take advantage of the safe harbor for forward looking statements provided by the securities litigation reform act of the act  and is including this information in its annual report on form k in order to do so 
the company has identified the following important factors which could cause the company s actual operational or financial results to differ materially from any projections  estimates  forecasts or other forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
under no circumstances should the factors listed below be construed as an exhaustive list of all factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements made by the company 
limited operating history  lack of profitable operations the company commenced operations in and has a limited operating history upon which investors may evaluate its performance 
with the exception of  the company has recognized losses in each year since its inception 
there can be no assurance that the company will be profitable during future periods 
fluctuations in quarterly results the company is subject to significant fluctuations in quarterly results caused by many factors  including the company s success in obtaining new contracts  the size and duration of the clinical trials in which the company and members of its network of affiliated sites participate  the timing of sponsor decisions to conduct new clinical trials or cancel or delay ongoing trials and other factors 
as a result of the company s limited operating history  the company does not have historical financial data for a significant number of periods on which to base planned operating expenses 
therefore  the company s expense levels are based in part on its expectations as to future revenue and to a certain extent are fixed 
there can be no assurance as to the company s revenue in any given period  and it may be unable to adjust expenses in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
as a result of the company s relatively small revenue base  any significant shortfall in revenue recognized during a particular period could have an immediate adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to accurately anticipate quarterly results 
volatility in the company s quarterly results may adversely affect the market price of the company s common shares 
risks associated with unproven business strategies and early stage of the company s development the company s efforts to establish a network of affiliated sites and market the network as a method of streamlining the process of selecting investigators  conducting clinical trials and to establish a standardized edc and qrc process for collection and management of clinical research data represent a significant departure from the traditional clinical research practices of sponsors 
the long term viability of the company s strategy remains unproven 
there can be no assurance that the company s strategy will continue to gain acceptance among sponsors  research sites or investigators 
in that regard  the company has undertaken a number of strategic initiatives intended to expand the scope of its services 
these initiatives are identified in this form k and in the company s other sec filings 
all of these initiatives are based upon assumptions made by the company concerning trends in the clinical research market and the health care industry 
any of these assumptions could prove to be incorrect  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company s prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in these efforts 
potential delay or loss of contracts although the company s contracts with sponsors provide that it is entitled to receive revenue earned through the date of termination  sponsors generally are free to delay or terminate a clinical trial or the company s contract related thereto at any time 
the length of a typical clinical trial contract varies from several months to several years 
sponsors may delay or terminate clinical trials for several reasons  including unexpected results or adverse patient reactions to a potential product  inadequate patient enrollment or investigator recruitment  manufacturing problems resulting in shortages of a potential product or decisions by the sponsor to de emphasize or terminate a particular trial or drug 
a sponsor s decision to delay or terminate a trial in which the company participates could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on major customers the company s primary customers are companies in the pharmaceutical industry 
the company s business is substantially dependent on the research and development expenditures of companies in this industry 
during each of the three years in the period ended december   sales to companies in the pharmaceutical industry accounted for more than of the company s revenue 
during and  respectively  sales to merck co  inc accounted for approximately and of the company s revenue 
also during  sales to dey laboratories accounted for of the company s revenue 
other customers in the pharmaceutical industry have from time to time accounted for more than of the company s annual revenue 
the extent to which the company relies on sales to one customer varies from period to period  depending upon  among other things  its ability to generate new business  the timing and size of clinical trials and other factors 
in light of the company s small revenue base  it is more dependent on major customers than many of the larger participants in the clinical research industry 
the company s operations could be materially and adversely affected by  among other things  any economic downturn in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries  any decrease in their research and development expenditures or a change in the regulatory environment in which these companies operate 
risks associated with acquisitions and joint ventures the company has made several acquisitions and has begun a number of joint ventures 
management expects to continue to seek and evaluate such opportunities in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully integrate and profitably manage the businesses acquired and joint ventures entered to date or that it will be able to identify  acquire  successfully integrate or profitably manage additional acquisitions and joint ventures without substantial costs  delays or other problems 
in addition  there can be no assurance that such endeavors will be profitable at the time of their acquisition or that these businesses will achieve or maintain revenue and profitability that justify the investment therein 
such endeavors involve a number of special risks  including adverse effects on the company s reported operating results  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  diversion of management s attention  dependence on retention  hiring and training of key personnel  risks associated with unanticipated problems or legal liabilities and amortization of goodwill and acquired company intangible assets  or the write off of assets with diminished value  some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
effect of expansion strategy on the company s core business the company s efforts to expand the range of its services expose it to significant risks 
as the company expands its ability to conduct clinical research through acquisitions and otherwise  circumstances will arise in which it will compete for research projects with its affiliated sites 
there can be no assurance as to the impact of this competition on the company s relationship with its current affiliated sites or on its ability to continue to expand the affiliated site network 
the company s inability to continue to expand its network of affiliated sites  or the withdrawal of a significant number of affiliated sites or those with expertise in certain therapeutic areas  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  because of the rapid access to clinical investigators provided by the company s affiliated site network  cros have from time to time engaged the company to assist them in the site selection process 
during fiscal  and  services provided to cros represented approximately  and  respectively  of the company s total revenue 
there is no assurance that cros will continue to do business with the company 
management of growth  need for improved systems the company believes that the expansion of its business will continue to place a strain on its operational  human and financial resources 
in order to manage such expansion  the company must continue to improve its operating  administrative and information systems and accurately predict its future personnel and resource needs 
in addition  expansion of foreign operations also may involve the additional risks of assimilating differences in foreign business practices  hiring and retaining qualified personnel and overcoming language barriers 
failure by the company to meet the demands of and to manage expansion of its business and operations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
limited obligations of affiliated sites the company s network of affiliated sites is essential to its business 
the company enters into affiliation agreements with each affiliated site 
the obligations of affiliated sites under the affiliation agreements are limited 
affiliated sites have full discretion as to whether to participate in clinical research opportunities presented by the company  are free to pursue research opportunities presented to them from sources other than the company and may withdraw from the network at any time 
dependence on key personnel as of january   the company had approximately full time employees  of whom eight had executive and managerial responsibilities 
the company s growth continues to place significant demands on its management resources 
the success of the company s business is dependent on the services of its senior management team  which changed substantially in the company has employment agreements with all but one of its executive officers 
the loss of the services of any of its executive officers could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s performance depends on its ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
the level of competition among employers for skilled personnel is high 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel 
government regulation  potential impact of health care reform demand for the company s services is largely a function of the regulatory requirements associated with the approval of an nda by the fda 
these requirements are more stringent and thus more burdensome than those imposed by many other developed countries 
in recent years  efforts have been made to streamline the drug approval process and coordinate us standards with those of other developed countries 
changes in the level of regulation  including a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of simplified drug approval procedures could have a material adverse effect on the demand for the company s services 
several competing proposals to reform the system of health care delivery in the united states have been considered by congress from time to time 
none of the proposals have been adopted 
the fda s guidelines related to the use of computerized systems in clinical trials are still in the early stages of development 
there can be no assurance that the datatrak r process can be kept in compliance with these guidelines as they develop 
the failure of the company to comply with applicable regulations could result in the termination of on going research or the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities 
further  the issuance of a notice or finding by the fda to either the company or its clients based upon a material violation by the company of either good clinical practices or good laboratory practices could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
competition the clinical research industry is highly fragmented and is comprised of several large  full service cros and many small cros and limited service providers 
the major competitors in the industry include the research departments of pharmaceutical companies  cros and smos 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than the company  and there can be no assurance of the company s ability to continue to compete effectively with these larger competitors 
there can be no assurance that these larger competitors will not develop their own networks of affiliated sites  nor as to the effect of such competing networks on the company s operations 
the company may also face competition from other networks of research sites in the recruitment of potential affiliated sites 
the electronic data capture market  which is still developing  is also highly fragmented 
the major competitors include edc software vendors  clinical trial data service companies and in house development efforts within large pharmaceutical companies 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to capture or establish the market presence necessary to effectively compete in this emerging sector of the clinical research industry 
potential liability from operations clinical trials involve the testing of approved and experimental drugs on human beings 
this testing carries with it a significant risk of liability for personal injury or death to participants resulting from an adverse reaction to  or improper administration of  the potential product 
the company participates with sponsors in the site selection process 
the company also contracts on behalf of its customers with physicians who render  and itself renders  professional services including administering the drugs being tested to participants in these trials 
consequently  the company may be subject to claims in the event of personal injury or death of persons participating in clinical trials and arising from professional malpractice of physicians with whom it has contracted and its own employees 
although the company is generally indemnified by its clients for such liability  in order for such indemnification to be valid  the company and its employees and agents must act within the bounds of specific procedural requirements governing the conduct of the clinical trial 
since the value of the company s indemnification depends on the financial viability of the indemnifying party  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to rely on such indemnification in each instance of potential liability 
in addition  the company has significant involvement in the patient treatment process at its owned research facilities 
accordingly  the company s risk of liability for malpractice is increased 
if the company was forced to undertake the defense of  or found financially responsible for  claims based upon the foregoing or related risks  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
anti takeover provisions  preferred share purchase rights the company s articles of incorporation and by laws contain provisions that may discourage a third party from acquiring  or attempting to acquire the company 
these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay for common shares of the company s stock 
in addition preferred shares of the company s stock can be issued by the company s board of directors  without shareholder approval  whether under the company s shareholder rights plan or for other uses determined by the board 
the issuance of preferred shares may adversely affect the rights of common shareholders  the market price of the common shares and may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of the outstanding common shares of the company 
at the present time  the company does not plan to issue any preferred shares
