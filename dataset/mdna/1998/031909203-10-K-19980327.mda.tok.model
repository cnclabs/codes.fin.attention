the retained interests in securitizations are valued at the discounted present value of the cash flows expected to be realized over the anticipated average life of the assets sold after future estimated credit losses  estimated prepayments and normal servicing and other fees related to assets sold 
the discounted present value of such retained interests is computed using management s assumptions of market discount rates  prepayment rates  default rates  credit losses and other costs

the company believes that the ability to accumulate loans under warehouse lines of credit and to repay the loans with the proceeds of a subsequent securitization of the loans has permitted the company to deploy its capital resources across a broader revenue generating base than would have been possible using traditional corporate debt financing techniques 
in addition  the gain recognized on the securitization of loans and the interest income derived from securities retained by the company from securitizations provide an important source of revenue 
in determining the amount of gain on sale from securitizations and the value of retained securities  the company employs discount rates and assumes prepayment rates and a loss experience that it believes are reasonable and prudent 
the company periodically evaluates the assumptions used and makes any adjustments to assumed prepayment rates  default rates and discount rates that may be necessary or appropriate given the market conditions at that time or other appropriate factors 
the company views prepayment rates in the residential markets as less predictable than in other markets  such as the commercial real estate lending and franchise finance markets where prepayment penalties tend to discourage prepayments 
it has been the company s practice to employ conservative assumptions with respect to prepayment and loss rates for its residential mortgage loan securitizations 
for its residential mortgage loan securitizations for the years ended december  and  the company has initially valued its retained interest using a discount rate of and has assumed prepayment methodologies which reflect over the life constant prepayment rates ranging from to and blended annualized loss rates ranging from to with variations within the ranges primarily depending upon mix of loan types 
the company has also used a discount rate in its franchise loan securitizations in however  the company has assumed no prepayments or losses with respect to loans in these securitized portfolios 
aclc structures its franchise loans with limited cross guarantees between borrowers such that the borrowers within a defined pool of loans absorb the first of net losses 
at the present time  the company considers it unlikely that net losses on franchise loan portfolios will exceed 
aclc and its predecessors have experienced no losses on franchise loans since their inception in accordingly  losses are assumed to be zero 
the no prepayments assumption is based on aclc s historical prepayment experience and the significant prepayment penalties applicable to the franchise loans which compensate the company for much of any lost earnings from prepayments 
other matters on march   the company purchased the stock of commercial lending corporation and the operations and specific assets of certain affiliates and renamed the business amresco commercial lending corporation 
aclc s primary line of business is originating  securitizing  selling and servicing franchise loans

on january   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities  which requires an entity to recognize the financial and servicing assets it controls and the liabilities it has incurred and to derecognize financial assets when control has been surrendered
