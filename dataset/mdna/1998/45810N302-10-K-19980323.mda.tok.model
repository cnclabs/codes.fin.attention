effective in october and january  due to the company revising the terms of the management agreements related to the long island and boston network sites  respectively  the company will no longer display patient service revenues of the long island and boston medical practices in revenues  net in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
the revised management agreements provide for the company to receive a specific management fee which the company will report in revenues  net in its consolidated statement of operations
