approximately of the company s debt portfolio of million was subject to changes in short term interest rates as of december  year the company has conducted a review of its computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the year issue 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations 
the company presently believes that  with modifications to existing software or conversion to new software  the year problem will not pose significant operational problems for the company s computer systems as so modified or converted 
the company is also surveying critical suppliers and customers to determine the status of their year compliance programs 
at this time  the company has not determined the total cost of modifying or replacing its software 
however  management does not believe that these costs will materially impact the company s results of operations  financial condition or cash flows
