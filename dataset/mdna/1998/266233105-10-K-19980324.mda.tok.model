 the company s consolidated financial statements reflect regulatory assets and liabilities consistent with cost based  pre competition ratemaking regulations 
the regulatory assets represent probable future revenue to the company because provisions for these costs are currently included  or are expected to be included  in charges to electric utility customers through the ratemaking process 
a company s electric utility operations  or a portion of such operations  could cease to meet the sfas no 
criteria for various reasons  including a change in the ferc regulations or the competition related changes in the puc regulations 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations rate matters on page the emerging issues task force of the financial accounting standards board eitf has determined that once a transition plan has been approved  application of sfas no 
to the generation portion of a utility must be discontinued and replaced by the application of sfas no 
 regulated enterprises accounting for the discontinuation of application of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

the consensus reached by the eitf provides further guidance that the regulatory assets and liabilities of the generation portion of a utility to which sfas no 
is being applied should be determined on the basis of the source from which the regulated cash flows to realize such regulatory assets and settle such liabilities will be derived 
under the customer choice act  the company believes that its generation related regulatory assets will be recovered through a competitive transition charge ctc collected in connection with providing transmission and distribution services  and the company will continue to apply sfas no 
fixed assets related to the generation portion of a utility will be evaluated including the cash flows provided by the ctc  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas no 

the company believes that all of its regulatory assets continue to satisfy the sfas no 
criteria in light of the transition to competitive generation under the customer choice act and the ability to recover these regulatory assets through a ctc 
once any portion of the company s electric utility operations is deemed to no longer meet the sfas no 
criteria  or is not recovered through a ctc  the company will be required to write off assets to the extent their net book value exceeds fair value  the recovery of which is uncertain  and any regulatory assets or liabilities for those operations that no longer meet these requirements

the company is party to a labor contract expiring in september with the international brotherhood of electrical workers  which represents approximately  of the company s employees 
the contract provides  among other things  employment security  income protection and percent annual wage increases through september electric utility operations the company s fossil plants operated at an equivalent availability factor of percent in and percent in the company s nuclear plants operated at an equivalent availability factor of percent in and percent in bv unit went off line on september   for a scheduled refueling outage  and returned to service on january  perry unit completed a refueling outage on october  this outage lasted days  a record for perry unit the next refueling outage for bv unit is currently scheduled to begin in april the next refueling outages for bv unit and perry unit are currently scheduled to begin in september and march  respectively 
the timing and duration of scheduled maintenance and refueling outages  as well as the duration of forced outages  affect the availability of power stations 
the company normally experiences its peak demand in the summer 
the and all time customer system peak demand of  mw occurred on july  bv unit went off line january   due to an issue identified in a technical review recently completed by the company 
bv unit went off line december   to repair the emergency air supply system to the control room and has remained off line due to other issues identified by a similar technical review of bv unit these technical reviews are in response to a commitment made by the company to the nrc 
the company is one of many utilities faced with these technical issues  some of which date back to the original design of beaver valley power station bvps 
both bvps units remain off line for a revalidation of technical specification surveillance testing requirements of various plant systems 
based on the current status of the revalidation process  the company currently anticipates that both bvps units will remain off line through march bvps s two units are equipped with steam generators designed and built by westinghouse electric corporation westinghouse 
similar to other westinghouse nuclear plants  outside diameter stress corrosion cracking odscc has occurred in the steam generator tubes of both units 
the units continue to operate at percent reactor power  although approximately percent of bv unit and percent of bv unit steam generator tubes have been removed from service 
material acceleration in the rate of odscc could lead to a loss in plant efficiency and significant repairs or replacement of bv unit steam generators 
the total replacement cost of the bv unit steam generators is estimated at million  million of which would be the company s responsibility 
the earliest that the bv unit steam generators could be replaced during a scheduled refueling outage is the fall of fossil fuel the company believes that sufficient coal for its coal fired generating units will be available from various sources to satisfy its requirements for the foreseeable future 
during  approximately million tons of coal were consumed at the company s two wholly owned coal fired stations  cheswick power station cheswick and elrama power station elrama 
the company owns warwick mine  an underground mine located in southwestern pennsylvania 
at december   the company s net investment in the mine was million 
the company estimates that  at december   its economically recoverable coal reserves at warwick mine were in excess of million tons 
an unaffiliated contract operator at warwick mine encountered adverse geologic conditions late in that resulted in a contract default 
commencing in  a new unaffiliated operator began producing approximately  tons of coal per year for exclusive use at elrama 
the company purchases the remaining coal for use at elrama on the open market 
the current estimated liability for mine closing  including final site reclamation  mine water treatment and certain labor liabilities is million  and the company has recorded a liability on the consolidated balance sheet of approximately million toward these costs 
during  percent of the company s coal supplies were provided by contracts  including warwick mine  with the remainder satisfied through purchases on the spot market 
the company had three long term contracts in effect at december  that  in combination with spot market purchases  are expected to furnish an adequate future coal supply 
the company does not anticipate any difficulty in replacing or renewing these contracts as they expire from through at december   the company s wholly owned and jointly owned generating units had on hand an average coal supply of days 
nuclear fuel the cycle of production and utilization of nuclear fue consists of mining and milling of uranium ore and processing the ore into uranium concentrates  converting uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride  enriching the uranium hexafluoride  fabricating fuel assemblies  utilizing the nuclear fuel in the generating station reactor  and storing and disposing of spent fuel 
an adequate supply of uranium is under contract to meet the company s requirements for its jointly owned leased nuclear units through an adequate supply of conversion services through the year is also under contract 
enrichment services for the company s joint interests in bv units and and perry unit will be supplied through fiscal year under a united states enrichment corporation s usec utility services contract 
the company has terminated  at zero cost  all of its enrichment services requirements under this contract for the fiscal years through and is planning to secure required enrichment services during this period from other suppliers 
the company continues to review on an annual basis its alternatives for enrichment services for the years through under the usec contract and may terminate these future years if it can arrange more cost effective alternative enrichment services 
fuel fabrication contracts are in place to supply reload requirements through and respectively  for bv unit and bv unit and the life of plant for perry unit the company will continue to make arrangements for future uranium supply and related services  as required 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations nuclear fuel leasing discussion on page nuclear decommissioning the company expects to decommission bv unit  bv unit and perry unit no earlier than the expiration of each plant s operating license in  and at the end of its operating life  bv unit may be placed in safe storage until bv unit is ready to be decommissioned  at which time the units may be decommissioned together 
based on site specific studies conducted in for bv unit and bv unit  and a update of the study for perry unit  the company s approximate share of the total estimated decommissioning costs  including removal and decontamination costs  is million  million and million  respectively 
the amount currently being used to determine the company s cost of service related to decommissioning all three nuclear units is million 
the company is seeking recovery of any potential shortfall in decommissioning funding as part of either its restructuring plan or its stand alone plan 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations rate matters on page with respect to the transition to a competitive generation market  the customer choice act requires that utilities include a plan to mitigate any shortfall in decommissioning trust fund payments for the life of the facility with any future decommissioning filings 
consistent with this requirement  in the company increased its annual contributions to the decommissioning trusts by million to approximately million 
the company has received approval from the internal revenue service irs for qualification of percent of additional nuclear decommissioning trust funding for bv unit and perry unit  and percent for bv unit funding for nuclear decommissioning costs is deposited in external  segregated trust accounts and invested in a portfolio of corporate common stock and debt securities  municipal bonds  certificates of deposit and united states government securities 
the market value of the aggregate trust fund balances at december  totaled approximately million 
nuclear insurance the price anderson amendments to the atomic energy act of limit public liability from a single incident at a nuclear plant to billion 
the maximum available private primary insurance of million has been purchased by the company 
additional protection of billion would be provided by an assessment of up to million per incident on each nuclear unit in the united states 
the company s maximum total possible assessment  million  which is based on its ownership or leasehold interests in three nuclear generating units  would be limited to a maximum of million per incident per year 
this assessment is subject to indexing for inflation and may be subject to state premium taxes 
if assessments from the nuclear industry prove insufficient to pay claims  the united states congress could impose other revenue raising measures on the industry 
the company s share of insurance coverage for property damage  decommissioning and decontamination liability is billion 
the company would be responsible for its share of any damages in excess of insurance coverage 
in addition  if the property damage reserves of nuclear electric insurance limited neil  an industry mutual insurance company that provides a portion of this coverage  are inadequate to cover claims arising from an incident at any united states nuclear site covered by that insurer  the company could be assessed retrospective premiums totaling a maximum of million 
in addition  the company participates in a neil program that provides insurance for the increased cost of generation and or purchased power resulting from an accidental outage of a nuclear unit 
subject to the policy deductible  terms and limit  the coverage provides for a weekly indemnity of the estimated incremental costs during the three year period starting weeks after an accident  with no coverage thereafter 
if neil s losses for this program ever exceed its reserves  the company could be assessed retrospective premiums totaling a maximum of million 
spent nuclear fuel disposal the nuclear waste policy act of established a federal policy for handling and disposing of spent nuclear fuel and a policy requiring the establishment of a final repository to accept spent nuclear fuel 
electric utility companies have entered into contracts with the united states department of energy doe for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high level radioactive waste in compliance with this legislation 
the doe has indicated that its repository under these contracts will not be available for acceptance of spent nuclear fuel before the doe has not yet established an interim or permanent storage facility  despite a ruling by the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit that the doe was legally obligated to begin acceptance of spent nuclear fuel for disposal by january  existing on site spent nuclear fuel storage capacities at bv unit  bv unit and perry unit are expected to be sufficient until  and  respectively 
in early  the company joined other electric utilities and states  state agencies and regulatory commissions in filing suit in the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit against the doe 
the parties requested the court to suspend the utilities payments into the nuclear waste fund and to place future payments into an escrow account until the doe fulfills its obligation to accept spent nuclear fuel 
the doe had requested that the court delay litigation while it pursued alternative dispute resolution under the terms of its contracts with the utilities 
the court ruling  issued november   was not entirely in favor of the doe or the utilities 
the court permitted the doe to pursue alternative dispute resolution  but prohibited it from using its lack of a spent fuel repository as a defense 
the doe has requested a rehearing on the matter  which has yet to be scheduled 
uranium enrichment obligations nuclear reactor licensees in the united states are assessed annually for the decontamination and decommissioning of doe uranium enrichment facilities 
assessments are based on the amount of uranium a utility had processed for enrichment prior to enactment of the national energy policy act of nepa and are to be paid by such utilities over a year period 
at december   the company s liability for contributions was approximately million subject to an inflation adjustment 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations rate matters on page environmental matters various federal and state authorities regulate the company with respect to air and water quality and other environmental matters 
the company believes it is in current compliance with all material applicable environmental regulations 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of and the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of superfund established a variety of informational and environmental action programs 
the environmental protection agency epa previously informed the company of its potential involvement in three hazardous waste sites 
the company reached agreements to make de minimis financial settlements related to these sites in order to resolve any associated liability 
through its acquisition of gsf energy gsf  the company indirectly became involved in three additional hazardous waste sites 
gsf was a minor contributor of materials to each site  and other solvent potentially responsible parties are involved 
gsf believes that available defenses  along with its overall limited involvement  will limit any potential liability it may have for clean up costs 
additionally  as part of the gsf acquisition the company is indemnified for any costs that it may incur related to these sites by at least one financially responsible party 
accordingly  the company believes that these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
as required by title v of the clean air act amendments clean air act  the company filed comprehensive air operating permit applications for cheswick  elrama  bi and phillips during the last half of approval is still pending for these applications 
the company filed its title iv phase ii clean air act compliance plan with the puc on december  the company also filed title iv phase ii permit applications for oxides of nitrogen no x emissions from cheswick  elrama and phillips with the allegheny county health department and the pennsylvania department of environmental protection dep on december  although the company believes it has satisfied all of the phase i acid rain program requirements of the clean air act  the phase ii acid rain program requires significant additional reductions of sulfur dioxide so and no x by the year the company currently has mw of nuclear capacity and mw of coal capacity equipped with so emission reducing equipment excluding mw of regulatory assets at phillips 
through the year  the company is considering a combination of compliance methods that include fuel switching  increased use of  and improvements in  so emission reducing equipment  low no x burner technology  and the purchase of emission allowances for those remaining stations not in compliance 
the company has developed  patented and installed low no x burner technology for the elrama boilers 
these cost effective no x reduction systems installed on the elrama roof fired boilers were specified as the benchmark for the industry for this class of boilers in the epa s final group ii rulemaking 
the company is also currently evaluating additional low cost  developmental no x reduction technologies at cheswick 
in the company tested combustion related no x controls at cheswick  with positive results  and expects to install low cost modifications and a new flue gas conditioning system to maximize the effects of such controls 
in addition to the phase ii acid rain program requirements  the company is responsible for additional no x reduction requirements to meet the current ozone ambient air quality standards under title i of the clean air act 
compliance with the current ozone standard is based on pre ozone data using a one hour average value approach 
flue gas conditioning and post combustion no x reduction technologies may be employed to meet the one hour standard if economically justified 
also  the company is examining and developing innovative emissions technologies designed to reduce costs 
the company also continues to work with the operators of its jointly owned stations to implement cost effective compliance strategies to meet these requirements 
the company is closely monitoring other future air quality programs and air emission control requirements that could result from more stringent ambient air quality and emission standards for so and no x particulates and other by products of coal combustion 
in  the dep finalized a regulation to implement the additional no x control requirements that were recommended by the ozone transport commission 
the estimated costs to comply with this program have been included in the company s capital cost estimates through the year the company currently estimates that additional capital costs to comply with clean air act requirements through the year will be approximately million 
in july  the epa announced new national ambient air quality standards for ozone and fine particulate matter 
to allow each state time to determine what areas may not meet the standards and to adopt control strategies to achieve compliance  the ozone standards will not be implemented until  and the fine particulate matter standards will not be implemented until or later 
because appropriate state ambient air monitoring and implementation plans have not been developed  the costs of compliance with these new standards cannot be determined by the company at this time 
in december  more than nations reached a preliminary agreement kyoto protocol  under which  among other things  the united states would be required to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions during the years through however  as the kyoto protocol has yet to be either signed or ratified  and the related greenhouse gas reduction programs remain undeveloped  the costs of compliance cannot be determined by the company at this time 
in  the dep issued residual waste management regulations governing the generation and management of non hazardous residual waste  such as coal ash 
the company is assessing the sites it utilizes and has developed compliance strategies that are currently under review by the dep 
capital costs of million were incurred by the company in to comply with these dep regulations 
based on information currently available  approximately million will be spent in the additional capital cost of compliance through the year is estimated  based on current information  to be approximately million 
this estimate is subject to the results of groundwater assessments and dep final approval of compliance plans 
the company is involved in various other environmental matters 
the company believes that such matters  in total  will not have a materially adverse effect on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
other customer advanced reliability system the customer advanced reliability system cars is a communications service that provides the company with an electronic link to its customers  including the ability to read customer meters 
in september  the company amended its service contract with itron  inc  with respect to cars 
the amendment extends by one year  into  the period during which itron  inc  will install and finalize the system 
as of december   more than percent of customers meters had been adapted for cars  and more than  meters were being read automatically 
year many existing computer programs use only two digits to identify a year for example  is used to represent 
such programs read as the year  and thus may not recognize dates beginning with the year  or may otherwise produce erroneous results or cease processing when dates after are encountered 
such failures could cause disruptions in normal business operations 
in  the company inventoried and assessed the critical information systems that impact operations and financial reporting including systems with respect to the general ledger  supply chain  billing  payroll  human resources  financial reporting and certain types of data for plant maintenance in order to develop a strategy to address required computer software changes and upgrades relating to such operations 
by  a plan to test and  as necessary  replace  upgrade or repair these systems had been developed and implementation had begun  with an anticipated completion date in although implementation of the plan has been accelerated in certain respects by year issues  the planned replacement  upgrade and repair of the systems is also generally required for business purposes unrelated to the year issue 
the company currently believes that implementation of the plan will minimize its year issues relating to these systems 
replacement  upgrade and repair projects that have been completed or are currently in progress include  without limitation  the replacement of an integrated plant maintenance system at bvps including related computer hardware  replacement of the supply chain purchasing and inventory system  and release upgrades of packaged software for the corporate financial recordkeeping system 
the cost of all such projects is currently estimated to be million  approximately one half of which had been incurred through duquesne has been expensing or capitalizing such costs in accordance with appropriate accounting policies 
the company has assembled a team to inventory and assess the year issues that impact it 
the team is comprised of management representatives from all functional areas of the company s businesses 
in addition to monitoring the information systems plan described above  the goals of the team include an assessment of the company s exposure to year related problems in devices and equipment containing embedded microprocessors that may not correctly identify the year  as well as potential problems that may originate with third parties outside the company s control 
the company also participates in the electric power research institute s project to share information about technical issues regarding the year problem with other entities in the electric utility industry 
given the fact that the company s assessment  as noted above  is currently in progress  the company cannot currently estimate the exact extent of any outstanding year systems and equipment issues  the specific time frame in which any required corrections would need to be made and the costs to the company in correcting any possible related outstanding matters 
until the company s assessment is completed  it cannot determine whether year issues and related costs will be material to the company s operations  financial condition and results of operations 
retirement plan measurement assumptions the company decreased the discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation on the company s retirement plans at december  to percent

rate matters the electric utility industry continues to undergo fundamental change in response to development of open transmission access and increased availability of energy alternatives 
under historical ratemaking practice  regulated electric utilities were granted exclusive geographic franchises to sell electricity in exchange for making investments and incurring obligations to serve customers under the then existing regulatory framework 
through the ratemaking process  those prudently incurred costs were recovered from customers along with a return on the investment 
additionally  certain operating costs were approved for deferral for future recovery from customers regulatory assets 
as a result of this historical ratemaking process  utilities have assets recorded on their balance sheets at above market costs  thus creating transition or stranded costs 
in pennsylvania  the customer choice act went into effect january  the customer choice act enables pennsylvania s electric utility customers to purchase electricity at market prices from a variety of electric generation suppliers customer choice 
although the customer choice act will give customers their choice of electric generation suppliers  delivery of the electricity from the generation supplier to the customer will remain the responsibility of the existing franchised utility 
the customer choice act also provides that the existing franchised utility may recover  through a ctc  an amount of transition costs that are determined by the puc to be just and reasonable 
pennsylvania s electric utility restructuring is being accomplished through a two stage process consisting of an initial customer choice pilot period running through and a phase in to competition period beginning in 
for the first stage  the company filed a pilot program with the puc on february  for the second stage  the company filed on august  its restructuring and merger plan the restructuring plan and its stand alone restructuring plan the stand alone plan with the puc 
see the detailed discussion of these plans on page customer choice pilots the pilot period gives utilities an opportunity to examine a wide range of technical and administrative details related to competitive markets  including metering  billing  and cost and design of unbundled electric services 
the company pilot filing proposed unbundling transmission  distribution  generation and competitive transition charges and offered participating customers the same options that were to be available in a competitive generation market 
the pilot was designed to comprise approximately percent of the company s residential  commercial and industrial demand 
the  customers participating in the pilot may choose unbundled service  with their electricity provided by an alternative generation supplier  and will be subject to unbundled distribution and ctc charges approved by the puc and unbundled transmission charges pursuant to the company s ferc approved tariff 
on may   the puc issued a preliminary opinion and order approving the company s filing in part  and requiring certain revisions 
the company and other utilities objected to several features of the puc s preliminary opinion and order 
hearings on several key issues were held in july 
the puc issued its final order on august   approving a revised pilot program for the company 
on september   the company appealed the determination of the market price of generation set forth in this order to the commonwealth court of pennsylvania 
the company expects a hearing to be scheduled for mid although this appeal is pending  the company complied with the puc s order to implement the pilot program that began on november  financial impact of pilot program order it is anticipated that the net financial impact of the company s customers choosing alternative generation suppliers during the pilot period through will be a reduction of operating revenues of approximately million per month 
see forward looking statements discussion on page the company is seeking in its restructuring plan and its stand alone plan to maintain current rates under section v of the customer choice act rate cap provision  which states that in certain circumstances an electric distribution utility may roll its energy cost rate into base rates without reducing its rates below the capped level if the puc determines that excess earnings are to be used for mitigation of transition costs 
the company will reduce its accelerated nuclear lease amortization to offset the shortfall  if any  in operating revenues between the pilot program and the final approved rates 
phase in to competition the phase in to competition begins on january   when percent of customers will have customer choice including customers covered by the pilot program  percent of customers will have customer choice no later than january   and all customers will have customer choice no later than january  however  in its sole order to date the peco order  the puc ordered the phase in provisions of the customer choice act to require the acceleration of the second and third phases to january  and january   respectively 
as they are phased in  customers that have chosen an electricity generation supplier other than the company will pay that supplier for generation charges  and will pay the company a ctc discussed below and unbundled charges for transmission and distribution 
customers that continue to buy their generation from the company will pay for their service at current regulated tariff rates divided into unbundled generation  transmission and distribution charges 
the peco order concluded that under the customer choice act  an electric distribution company  such as duquesne  is to remain a regulated utility and may only offer puc approved  tariffed rates including unbundled generation rates 
delivery of electricity including transmission  distribution and customer service will continue to be regulated in substantially the same manner as under current regulation 
rate cap and transition cost recovery before the phase in to customer choice begins in  the puc expects utilities to take vigorous steps to mitigate transition costs as much as possible without increasing the rates they currently charge customers 
the company has mitigated in excess of million of transition costs during the past three years through accelerated annual depreciation and a one time write down of nuclear generating station costs  accelerated recognition of nuclear lease costs  increased nuclear decommissioning funding  and amortization of various regulatory assets 
this relative level of transition cost reduction  while holding rates constant  is unmatched within pennsylvania 
the puc will determine what portion of a utility s transition costs that remain at january  will be recoverable through a ctc from customers 
the ctc recovery period could last through  providing a utility a total of up to nine years beginning january  to recover transition costs  unless this period is extended as part of a utility s puc approved transition plan 
an overall four and one half year rate cap from january  will be imposed on the transmission and distribution charges of electric utility companies 
additionally  electric utility companies may not increase the generation price component of rates as long as transition costs are being recovered  with certain exceptions 
following is a summary of the company s requested transition cost recovery  net of deferred taxes  as of january   the related net balances as of december   and the amounts mitigated during the past three years 
transition costs mitigation balance ctc recovery amounts in millions of dollars requested nuclear generation plant a fossil generation plant a generation related regulatory assets b decommissioning costs c total   a nuclear and fossil generation plant represent a projection of the amount by which the net book value  including materials and supplies inventories  and fuel inventories  of the generating plants exceeds the market value for these plants 
nuclear generation plant also includes the present value of future above market lease payments related to the sale leaseback of bv unit b generation related regulatory assets represent costs which under the historical ratemaking process were deemed recoverable from customers through future rates 
these regulatory assets include  among other items  amounts related to future federal income tax payments  premiums paid to reacquire debt  initial operating costs of bv unit and perry unit  and energy costs not recovered currently 
c decommissioning costs represent the estimated present value of unfunded fossil and nuclear generation plant decommissioning costs 
financial exposure to transition cost recovery any estimate of the ultimate level of transition costs including those set forth in the table above depends on  among other things  the extent to which such costs are deemed recoverable by the puc  the ongoing level of the company s costs of operations  regional and national economic conditions  and growth of the company s sales 
the company believes that it is entitled to recover substantially all of its transition costs  but cannot predict the outcome of this regulatory process 
see forward looking statements discussion on page indeed  the peco order provides for recovery by peco energy company peco of percent of transition costs determined to be just and reasonable by the puc 
however  in determining transition costs  the puc found the market value of peco s generating units to be significantly higher than the estimate of market value sponsored by peco 
thus  the total amount of transition costs requested by peco was significantly more than that allowed by the puc in the peco order  as the puc determined market value offset a larger portion of the transition costs 
the puc ordered recovery of peco s transition costs through a ctc is permitted over an eight and one half year period beginning january  however  peco is only permitted to earn a return on the unamortized balance of transition costs at a rate equal to its long term cost of debt 
in the event that the puc rules that any or all of the company s transition costs cannot be recovered through a ctc mechanism  or the company fails to satisfy the requirements of sfas no 
 these costs will be written off 
see item business regulation on page on january   peco announced that it was reducing its dividend by percent  and also that it was reporting a net loss for of billion  including an extraordinary charge of billion billion net of taxes in the fourth quarter of to reflect the effects of the peco order 
as the company has substantial exposure to transition costs relative to its size  significant transition cost write offs could have a materially adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
various financial covenants and restrictions could be violated if substantial write off of assets or recognition of liabilities occurs 
under such circumstances the company may face constraints on its ability to pay dividends see earnings and dividends discussion on page  issue new mortgage debt or maintain access to bank lines of credit  thus negatively impacting its operations 
timetable for restructuring plan and stand alone plan approval on august   the company filed the restructuring plan and the stand alone plan with the puc 
although the provisions of the customer choice act require a puc decision nine months from the filing date which would be april   the pennsylvania attorney general s office requested an extension in order to conduct an investigation into certain competition issues relating to the restructuring plan 
pursuant to an arrangement among the company  the puc and the attorney general  the company anticipates a decision by the puc with respect to the restructuring plan if the merger is approved  or with respect to the stand alone plan if the merger is not approved on or before may  or such later date as the parties may agree 
stand alone plan in the event the merger with aye is not consummated under the filed restructuring plan  the company has sought approval for restructuring and recovery of its own transition costs through a ctc under the stand alone plan 
the company proposed that any finding of market value for the company s generating assets should be based on market evidence and not on an administrative determination of that value based on price forecasts the peco order determined the market value of peco s generation based on the price forecast sponsored by the pennsylvania office of consumer advocate 
in addition  the company proposed that such a final market valuation be conducted in  and that an annual competitive market solicitation be used to set the ctc in the interim 
the final market valuation would be performed by an independent panel of experts using the best available market evidence at that time 
the stand alone plan filing also provided for certain triggers that would accelerate the date of this final market valuation 
prior to the final valuation  the company would sell a substantial amount of power to the highest bidder in an annual competitive solicitation 
the annual market price established by the solicitation would be used to set competitive generation credits and determine the ctc as a residual from the generation rate cap under the rate cap provision 
during the transition period  the company committed to accelerate amortization and depreciation of its generation related assets and cap its return on equity through a return on equity spillover mechanism  in exchange for being allowed to charge existing rates under the rate cap provision 
the company committed to a minimum of billion of amortization and depreciation of generation related assets by the end of under the proposed return on equity spillover mechanism  additional amortization and depreciation in excess of this minimum billion commitment would be recorded in order to comply with the return on equity cap 
the generation rate cap would apply to the sum of the ctc and the competitive generation credit determined in the annual competitive solicitation 
the stand alone plan also proposed to redesign individual tariffs to encourage more efficient consumption and further mitigate transition costs during the transition period 
consistent with the company s long standing commitment to economic development  the rate redesign provides for a significant reduction in the cost of electricity for incremental consumption 
application of the rate redesign to the ctc would also have the potential to maximize mitigation of transition costs during the transition period 
as an alternative to a market based valuation in  if the puc finds that a determination of market value as of december  is required by the customer choice act  then the company has agreed that the puc may order an immediate auction of the company s generation at that time 
restructuring plan the restructuring plan incorporates the benefits of the merger with aye  such as anticipated savings to the company  on a nominal basis  of million in generation related costs over years  and million in transmission related costs and million in distribution related costs over years 
the company plans to use the generation related portion of its share of net operating synergy savings to shorten the transition cost recovery period 
in addition  the anticipated cost savings are expected to permit the company to increase its minimum depreciation and amortization commitment by million  reduce distribution rates by million in  and freeze distribution rates at this reduced level until the merger related synergies are expected to enable the company to reduce its transition costs in by million 
see forward looking statements discussion below 
the restructuring plan also incorporates the market based approach to determining stranded costs proposed by the company in its stand alone plan 
the final market valuation will be performed by an independent panel of experts using the best available market evidence at that time  including a potential sale of a portion of the combined company s generating assets 
certain triggers will accelerate the date of this final market valuation if market prices rise significantly or the minimum amortization commitment is satisfied prior to the annual market price established by the company s solicitation would be used to set competitive generation credits and to determine the ctc as a residual from the generation rate cap under the rate cap provision 
the company s minimum amortization commitment of billion in the proposed stand alone plan has been increased under the restructuring plan 
as in the stand alone plan  the determination of transition costs in will compare the book value of generating assets in after netting the increased minimum commitment to depreciation and amortization and any return on equity spillover with the market value of the generating assets in the opposing parties believe that there should be a one time valuation of the generating assets performed at january  any merger related synergies relating to generation would then be used to reduce the company s transition costs as of that date 
these parties also believe that the company s proposed distribution rate decrease should be effective january   as well 
additional restructuring plan commitments the restructuring plan also contains a number of commitments by the merged dqe aye entity 
first  the merged entity will open up its transmission system to all parties on a reciprocal non discriminatory basis and eliminate multiple rate charges across the combined transmission system 
second  the merged entity will join a recently proposed midwest independent system operator iso or other then existing iso  or form its own iso if no existing iso offers acceptable rules  including marginal cost transmission rates 
several utilities have applications pending before the ferc to form isos 
third  the merged entity has committed to make a report  months after consummation of the merger  to the puc regarding its progress on the iso commitment 
the puc may  at its option  require the merged entity to relinquish control of mw of generating capacity to alleviate concerns over market power 
the form of relinquishment would be at the option of the merged entity  possible forms of relinquishment include an energy swap  entering a power sale contract  divestiture of generating assets and a bidding trust 
the federal filings in addition to the puc filings of the restructuring plan and the stand alone plan  on august   the company and aye filed their joint merger application with the ferc the ferc filing 
pursuant to the ferc filing  the company and aye have committed to forming or joining an iso that meets the entity s requirements  including marginal cost transmission pricing  following the merger 
in addition  the company and aye have stated in the ferc filing that following the merger the combined entity s market share will not violate the market power conditions and requirements set by the ferc 
on january   the company and aye filed merger applications with the antitrust division of the department of justice and the federal trade commission 
these applications are currently pending
