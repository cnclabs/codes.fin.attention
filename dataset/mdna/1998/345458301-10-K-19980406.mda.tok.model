item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview since its organization in june  the company has been engaged principally in oil exploration in the great basin and range of nevada  an area that management believes is one of the most promising unexplored onshore domestic areas with potential for the discovery of major oil reserves 
in continuing to advance this exploration  the company s strategy is to generate exploration prospects with the most recent generally available scientific techniques  expand and improve the company s strategic land position  and establish arrangements with other oil exploration firms active in nevada to obtain additional scientific data  leases  and funding 
until  the company had only limited revenue  consisting of modest amounts of interest income earned on net proceeds from the sale of securities and revenue from producing properties 
in order to supplement its own exploration efforts  between and  the company acquired certain leases and properties in railroad valley  nevada  including the eagle springs field 
since acquiring the eagle springs field  the company has reworked and returned to production eleven acquired wells  drilled a new water injection well  drilled and placed into production eight additional wells  replaced and improved surface equipment to handle increased production and to lower long term operating costs  completed a d seismic evaluation program  and implemented an eor program 
these efforts were funded in part between august and november  by barrett  which then held a working interest in the field 
in november  the company utilized proceeds from the sale of securities and its bank credit facility to purchase barrett s working interest in the eagle springs field for million  effective august  the eagle springs field has been the company s principal producing property since during  the company acquired leases to  additional acres in and adjacent to the eagle springs field and on which the kate springs well is located 
during  the company s production and reserves increased substantially as a result of its discovery of the ghost ranch field 
during  the company drilled and placed into production two additional wells in the ghost ranch field 
these drilling activities were funded in part by barrett  which held a interest in the ghost ranch field 
in january  the company utilized funds drawn from a recently established credit facility to purchase barrett s working interest in the ghost ranch field for  including adjustment for oil inventory and accrued expenses  effective december  during  the company utilized existing capital resources to drill additional wells in the ghost ranch and eagle springs field  develop a pilot study on an eor program for the eagle springs field  and initiate the eor pilot program 
the auditor s report on the financial statements of the company as of december   contains an explanatory paragraph as to the ability of the company to continue as a going concern because of its continuing losses from operations 
the company had a working capital deficit as of december   of 
the initial cash drawn of  under the financing arrangement was allocated for certain accrued eor and exploration costs and further specified development  d seismic data acquisition  and exploration drilling 
the company believes that the projected cash from operations  including the additional revenues expected to be received from development work to be completed during the year  will be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash requirements for  while funds from the initial draw down under its debt financing as well as further advances will fund significant exploration during the year 
results of operations and oil sales increased  or  to  in as compared to  consisting principally of an increase of  in ghost ranch field revenue offset by a  decrease in eagle springs field revenue and a  decrease in the revenue from the from the company s other properties 
the increase in total oil revenue was the result of an increase of in barrels of oil sold and a decrease of in the average price per barrel of oil sold 
operating and well service revenue increased  or  to  in as compared to  due to the drilling of two additional ghost ranch wells and production overhead charges on the three ghost ranch wells during oil and gas production cost for increased  or  reflecting the general increase in production during per barrel production expense increased per barrel  or  to in  as compared to per barrel in the eagle springs field contributed  of the increase  partially due to workover cost on the water injection well 
additionally the ghost ranch field contributed  of the increase due to two additional wells beginning operations in  and the company s remaining wells contributed  to the increased oil and gas production cost 
oil and gas exploration cost increased  or  to  in as compared to a year earlier as a result of the company s increased exploration activity 
primary contributors were exploration personnel cost increase of  while d seismic cost increased  when compared to the prior year s activity  and cost associated with lease rentals in increased  when compared to during  dry hole  abandonment and impairment costs decreased  or  to  as compared to the expenses includes  in impairment expense related to a well in progress at the end of that was determined to be uneconomic 
the company also expensed  in capitalized leasehold cost associated with leases that expired at the end of their primary term 
general and administrative expenses increased  or to  for as compared to administrative personnel cost increased  and a non cash compensation charge of  associated with the overriding royalty interest conveyed as part of an employee termination agreement was recognized in shareholder investor services decreased  during to  as compared to this decrease relates to a reduction in the number of investor relations advisors 
during the company incurred a non cash expense of  resulting from the application of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company did not have any such investor related expenses in during compensation for below market options increased  or when compared to these were primarily for options associated with debt retirement for four officers and directors 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased  or  in to  as compared to the previous year 
the increase was due principally to a significant increase in production combined with a decrease in reserves 
the december   oil prices adversely affect the reserve quantity of the company s reserves 
lower reserves and increased oil sales for increased the percentage used to calculate the depletion for during  net loss applicable to common stockholders was increased by dividends of  incurred on preferred stock converted during the year and imputed dividends of  as a result of convertibility of its outstanding preferred stock into common stock at below market prices 
these amounts are for earnings per share calculations only and are not recorded in the company s financial statements 
and oil sales increased  or  to  in as compared to  consisting principally of a  increase in eagle springs field revenue  including  from the purchase of barrett s working interest in the field on november  and  in revenue from the newly discovered ghost ranch well 
the increase in total oil revenue was the result of an increase of in barrels produced and in the average sales price of oil 
subsequent to december   oil prices have declined  but total barrels produced continued to increase as an additional ghost ranch well began production 
operating and well service revenue decreased  or  to  in as compared to  due to the purchase of barrett s interest in the eagle springs field 
other income during decreased  or  to  as compared to  because of reduced equipment rental and reduced sales of equipment inventory 
oil and gas production costs for increased  or  reflecting the general increase in production during however  per barrel production expense declined per barrel  or  to in  as compared to per barrel in  as a result of the spread of fixed production costs over an increased number of barrels produced  utilizing previous excess field operations capacity 
oil and gas exploration costs increased  or  to  in as compared to a year earlier as a result of the company s increased exploration activity  particularly during the latter half of during  dry hole  abandonment  and impairment costs increased  or  to  as compared to  again reflecting the company s increased exploration activity during this item includes  in expenses during for test wells that were plugged and abandoned as well as an impairment charge of   of which was a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
general and administrative expenses were approximately equal for and  during early  the company implemented certain cost containment measures due to temporary shortages of working capital and in the last part of increased its general and administrative resources to manage increased activities following the receipt of proceeds from the sales of securities during the year 
shareholder investor services increased  or over four fold  during to  as compared to this increase relates to repositioning the company in the investment community in connection with the three to one reverse stock split effected june   the engagement of investor relations advisors  and the preparation and publication of company information 
of such amount   is a non cash expense resulting from the promulgation of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company does not expect that such expenditures in similar amounts will continue 
during  for the first time in any of the three most recent fiscal years  the company recognized expenses for the issuance of options with an exercise price below market as of the date of grant for a total of  depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased  or in  to  as compared to the previous year 
the decrease was due principally to unusually high depletion recognized in which related to a marginal property with relatively high costs and increased reserves in  which were the result of the discovery of the ghost ranch field and generally higher oil prices during during  net loss was increased by dividends of  related to preferred stock outstanding during the year 
these dividends were paid or are payable in common stock 
the company incurred no such dividends in either of the preceding years 
a portion of the shares of preferred stock on which dividends were incurred during remain outstanding  so additional dividends will be incurred in during  net loss applicable to common stockholders increased by dividends of  incurred on preferred stock outstanding during the year and imputed dividends of million  as a result of convertibility of its outstanding preferred stock into common stock at below market prices 
these amounts are for earnings per share calculations and are not recorded in the company s financial statements 
accounting treatment of certain capitalized costs the company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities 
costs to acquire mineral interests in oil and gas properties  to drill and equip exploratory wells that find proved reserves  and to drill and equip development wells are capitalized 
costs to drill exploratory wells that do not find proved reserves  geological and geophysical costs  and costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties are expensed 
included in oil and gas properties on the company s balance sheets are costs of wells in progress 
as of december   the company had net capitalized costs of approximately  related to a well in progress 
such costs are capitalized until a decision is made to plug and abandon or  if the well is still being evaluated  until one year after reaching total depth  at which time such costs are charged to expense  even though the well may subsequently be placed into production 
during the company was required to adopt a new accounting policy that requires it to assess the carrying cost of long lived assets whenever events or changes of circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
when an assessment for impairment of oil and gas properties is performed  the company is required to compare the net carrying value of proved oil and gas properties on a lease by lease basis the lowest level at which cash flows can be determined on a consistent basis to the related estimates of undiscounted future net cash flows for such properties 
if the carrying value exceeds the net cash flows  then impairment is recognized to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value 
as a result of the adoption of this new accounting policy  at december   the company recognized an impairment charge of  during the first quarter of  and an impairment charge of  in the fourth quarter of the company expects that from time to time capitalized costs will be charged to expense based on management s evaluation of specific wells or properties or the disposition  through sales or conveyances of fractional interests in connection with industry sharing arrangements  of property interests 
as part of the company s evaluation of its oil and gas reserves in connection with the preparation of the company s annual financial statements  the company completes an engineering evaluation of its properties based on current engineering information  oil and gas prices  and production costs  which may result in material changes in the total undiscounted net present value of the company s oil and gas reserves and may  therefore  result in an impairment allowance as discussed above 
see item properties 
certain costs the costs of exploring  drilling  producing  and transporting are higher in the geological province targeted by management than they would be in a more fully developed oil producing area 
access roads to drilling targets over relatively long distances frequently have to be completed  drilling equipment and services typically must be brought in from considerable distances  and there is no collection pipeline so that any oil that is produced must be trucked to a refinery  the nearest of which is in salt lake city  utah  a distance of several hundred miles 
liquidity and capital resources previous periods historically the company has obtained cash required for its operating and investing requirements from financing activities  principally the sale of equity securities 
the company s operations used net cash of  in when the company reported a net loss of  the loss included non cash expenses of  for abandonment s and impairments including a  impairment of a well in progress at the end of that was determined to be uneconomic see accounting treatment of certain capitalized cost   for depreciation  depletion and amortization  and  for below market options 
components of working capital requiring cash expenditures included  used to reduce accounts payable and accrued expenses  and  for prepaid expenses and other miscellaneous assets 
components of working capital providing cash are a reduction of accounts receivable of  use of existing inventory of  and an increase of officers and other salaries payable of  this is compared to the company s operations that used net cash of  in when the company reported a net loss of  the loss included non cash expenses of  for abandonment s and impairments including a  impairment resulting from the adoption of a new accounting policy   for depreciation  depletion  and amortization   for the issuance of stock options for services  and  for below market stock options 
components of working capital requiring cash expenditures included  used to reduce accounts payable and accrued expenses   for increases in accounts receivable  and  for payments of officers salaries payable 
investing activities required cash of  in  including approximately million for additions to oil and gas properties  conversion cost for an air injection well for the pilot eor program in the eagle spring field and the completion of two ghost ranch wells 
additionally the company used  to purchase other property and equipment 
investing activities in required cash of  including approximately million for the purchase of barrett s working interest in the eagle springs field and approximately million for additions to oil and gas properties  principally the successful drilling in the ghost ranch field 
as noted above  cash required for both operating and investing activities was provided from financing activities during each of the fiscal years ending december  and financing activities for used  primarily for the payment of debt associated with the credit facility with colorado national bank 
during financing activities provided cash of  including net cash of  from the issuance of equity securities and  in net proceeds from borrowings after  was repaid to retire previous indebtedness and  drawn from the company s newly established bank credit facility 
in november  the company established a  credit facility with a commercial bank  collateralized by the company s eagle springs and ghost ranch producing properties and related assets 
in january the company paid in full the monies owed under this revolving credit agreement with proceeds from its new larger debt financing  discussed below 
in addition to the above  the company s oil and gas exploration and production activities were also advanced by approximately   and  provided during   and  respectively  by others under industry sharing arrangements related to specific drilling or other exploration 
debt financing in january  the company completed a million debt financing with energy income fund 
the funds will be used in the enhanced oil recovery program and development drilling in the eagle springs field  d seismic acquisition  the drilling of d defined exploration targets  the acquisition of producing properties  and to retire existing debt 
in january  the company borrowed  of its new available debt financing to fund the implementation of a high pressure air injection program  including compressors and buildings in the company s eagle springs field  a d seismic program on the company s pine creek property  the retirement of existing debt and the payment of closing costs 
an additional  was placed into an escrow account to fund the drilling and completion of two development wells and one exploratory well 
pursuant to the terms of the financing arrangement  the company is required to make payments of interest only through november  after which payments of principal and interest are required to amortize the indebtedness generally over a month period  provided  however  that the final payment of all accrued but unpaid interest and the remaining principal balance is due on january  the company also agreed to transfer to energy income fund a overriding royalty interest in the company s interest in the company s proved oil and gas properties and a overriding royalty interest in certain unproved properties 
amounts due under the financing arrangement are collateralized by oil and gas properties and the company is required to maintain certain financial ratios and comply with other terms and conditions while any balance of indebtedness remains outstanding 
the company has issued to energy income fund five year warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at per share and  shares at per share 
the company granted energy income fund the right to designate a representative for appointment to the board of directors of the company 
current position future requirements the company had a working capital deficit as of december   of  in january the company entered in an agreement with energy income fund associated energy managers for a million debt financing  which is available for certain projects 
the initial cash drawn of  under the financing arrangement was allocated for certain accrued eor and exploration costs and further specified development  d seismic data acquisition  and exploration drilling 
the company believes that the projected cash from operations  including the additional revenues expected to be received from development work to be completed during the year  will be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash requirements for  while funds from the initial draw down under its debt financing as well as further advances will fund significant exploration during the year 
based on current oil prices  the company s net production revenue alone is not currently sufficient to meet all of its cash requirements for oil and gas production costs  general and administrative expenses  ongoing shareholder investor relations  property maintenance expenditures  and payments of indebtedness 
the eor program started in the eagle springs field is proceeding as planned and based on initial results  the company believes this this program will lead to increased oil production from this field 
the company believes that the increase in production should provide the company sufficient funds to meet its cash requirements for its oil production cost  general and administrative expenses  ongoing shareholder investor relations  property maintenance expenditures and payment of indebtedness 
of course  there can be no assurance that production quantities or oil prices will not decline further  which may contribute to operating cash shortages 
the company has formed an industry exploration group and conducted a d seismic study in pine valley  nevada  to define additional targets for drilling during the exploration staff is currently evaluating the data provided by the d seismic study to determine future drilling sites 
the reserve engineer s report indicates that there are four drilling sites in the eagle springs field  however the company believes that that there are additional locations that would be step out drilling locations that would enlarge the eagle springs field 
the company spudded the eagle springs well on one of the step out locations and is currently waiting for the well to be completed 
the company estimates that on the reserve engineer s four locations in the eagle springs field  drilling and completion costs are approximately  for the year if all wells are drilled 
the company is exploring the possible purchase of additional production to increase the company s financial security and stability as it continues its exploration 
as part of this effort  in january  the company acquired the minority interest of barrett in the ghost ranch field for  with an effective date of december  the company is pursuing opportunities to purchase other properties that will require additional debt and equity financing 
one such property is the petro source refinery 
there can be no assurance that the company can negotiate the acquisition of any properties or that the company will be able to obtain funds that may be required or that such funds can be obtained on terms favorable to the company 
the nature  extent  and cost of exploring prospects in the great basin province over several years cannot be predicted  but the total cost could amount to tens of millions of dollars 
because of the size of the total exploration possibilities and the company s limited resources  it is likely that the interest of the company s shareholders in the company and the interest of the company in its drilling prospects will continue to be diluted substantially as the company continues to obtain funding through the sale of additional securities or through sharing arrangements with industry participants 
there can be no assurance that exploration funds will be available to the company when required or  if available  that such funds can be obtained on terms acceptable or favorable to the company 
the company may also utilize funds available under its new credit facility  cash now budgeted for exploration and development  as well as proceeds from the sale of additional equity securities or new borrowings to complete strategic corporate acquisitions 
no acquisition has been targeted  and there can be no assurance that any acquisition will be completed at all or on terms favorable to the company 
inflation the company s activities have not been  and in the near term are not expected to be  materially affected by inflation or changing prices in general 
the company s oil exploration and production activities are generally affected by prevailing sales prices for oil  however  and material price declines may make wells with low rates of production uneconomical to operate 
because of the size of potential discoveries in nevada  the company does not expect that short term declines in oil prices would materially affect its exploration activities 
impact of the year issue many existing computer programs use only two digits  rather than four  to define a year within the date field in order to conserve memory resources 
such programs were designed and developed without considering the potential impact of the upcoming change of the century 
the company uses computers principally for processing and analyzing geophysical and geophysical data  map making  and administrative functions  including word processing  accounting  and other applications 
after december   any of the computer programs used by the company that contain date sensitive computer codes that are not year compliant  may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year if not corrected  such computer applications could fail or create erroneous results 
the company has contacted its vendors who have represented that the systems and software used by the company are year compliant 
the company will require future vendors to make such representation 
there can be no assurance that such programs are actually year compliant 
the company also interacts with the computer systems of others 
there can be no assurance that such computer systems are year compliant 
the company believes that it will not incur material expenditures in connection with this issue  but there can be no assurance that the company has anticipated every circumstance where the company s operations may be impacted
