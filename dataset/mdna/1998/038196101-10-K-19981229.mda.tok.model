the lower average selling prices for opp films are attributable to highly competitive market conditions resulting from excess industry production capacity and characterized by substantial declines in selling prices  particularly of lower end commodity products 
aet s average selling prices were impacted by these price reductions as the proportion of lower end products in its sales mix increased in connection with the start up of the company s ten meter production line 
although average selling prices declined in  unit volume sales of opp films increased by percent due principally to the successful ramp up since march of the ten meter wide production line 
the sales volume increase was facilitated by this new capacity as well as investments made in recent years in new product development and an expanded sales and marketing organization

this sales revenue growth was facilitated by new capacity brought on stream during the third quarter of fiscal  investments in new product development and an expanded sales and marketing organization 
this increase in volume was offset in part by lower average selling prices  particularly in the fourth quarter  due to competitive pressures precipitated by lower capacity utilization in the opp films industry 
this lower capacity utilization was the result of the new capacity additions by aet and four of its competitors which were either on line at september  or started up in fiscal the lower average selling prices for the company during also resulted from a less favorable sales mix  impacted by a higher percentage of secondary material production due in part to the manufacture of a number of new products

year aet s company wide year project  which is addressing the issue of computer programs and embedded computer chips being unable to distinguish between the year and the year  is proceeding on schedule 
the project is comprised of five major phases taking inventory of systems potentially impacted by the year issue  assessing the year compliance or capability of systems determined to be material to the company  repairing or replacing material systems that are determined not to be year compliant or capable testing the repaired or replaced systems  and designing and implementing contingency and business continuation plans 
at september   aet had completed the inventory and assessment phases of the project 
those systems with identified year compliance or capability issues are currently being repaired or replaced  as required 
the largest part of this effort is the continuing implementation of a new enterprise wide information system which commenced in the financial  sales  order entry  electronic data interchange  and administrative portions of the implementation are complete 
the inventory  shop floor and related manufacturing portions of the system have been implemented in two production sites  with the remaining two plants expected to be completed by june  once year compliance repairs or replacements have been made  aet plans to test systems to verify that compliance has been achieved 
third parties will validate the year compliance of our manufacturing systems  and internal resources will validate the compliance of the remainder of our systems 
the target completion date for the systems testing is september  the total cost associated with year compliance activities is estimated to be  of which  will be spent on the new enterprise wide systems which offer many other enhancements in comparison to our current systems 
cash flow from operations is expected to fund the balance of the project 
no critical information technology projects have been deferred due to our year compliance efforts 
the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity  and financial condition 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party suppliers and customers  aet is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on aet s results of operations  liquidity  and financial condition 
aet believes that with the completion of the project as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be substantially reduced 
inflation management reviews the prices charged for its products on a regular basis 
when market conditions allow  adjustments are made to reflect changes in demand or product costs due to fluctuations in the cost of materials  labor and inflation 
the costs of raw materials make up a significant portion of aet s costs and have historically fluctuated 
there can be no assurance  however  that future market conditions will support any correlation between raw material cost fluctuations and finished product films pricing 
seasonal nature of certain opp markets certain of the end use markets for the company s opp films are seasonal 
for example  demand in the snack food  soft drink and candy markets is generally higher in the spring and summer 
as a result  sales and net income are generally higher in those periods

except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this report are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements  including those risks related to the timely development and acceptance of new products  fluctuations in raw materials and other production costs  the loss of one or more significant customers  the impact of competitive products and pricing  the timely completion of capital projects  the success of the company s efforts to access capital markets on satisfactory terms  and to acquire  integrate  and operate new businesses and expand into new markets  as well as other risks detailed in exhibit of the company s annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended september  and from time to time in the company s other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange contracts the company has entered into foreign exchange contracts  the last of which expires in october  to hedge firm purchase commitments for the purchase of equipment denominated in german marks and pounds sterling 
gains and losses on the contracts which result from market risk associated with changes in the market values of the underlying currencies are deferred and reported as part of the capitalized asset 
in entering into these contracts  the company has assumed the risk which might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts 
the company does not expect any losses as a result of counterparty defaults

the company s policy has been to utilize united states dollar denominated borrowings to fund its working capital and investment needs 
short term debt  if required  is used to meet working capital requirements  while long term debt is generally used to finance long term investments 
there is inherent roll over risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and the company s future financing requirements 
at september  the company had no short term debt outstanding and had long term debt outstanding of  of which  was outstanding on its revolving credit facility which has a variable interest rate  based on either libor or prime rates 
the company does not enter into financial instruments transactions for trading or other speculative purposes or to manage interest rate exposure 
with respect to the foreign exchange contracts  an adverse change in the underlying exchange rates would not have a significant effect on the company s reported results as any gain or loss on the contract would be offset by changes in the value of the firm purchase commitment 
a adverse change in interest rates on the portion of the company s debt bearing interest at variable rates would result in an increase in interest expense of approximately
