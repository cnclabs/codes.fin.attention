item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is a direct sales company which  through the distributor network  sells  installs and services a residential security alarm system marketed under the trade name securityguard  principally in australia and new zealand  with expanding international operations in europe  south africa and north america 
the company s revenues from securityguard system sales are recorded upon shipment by the company to area distributors and distributors and are net of any discounts 
revenues related to extended warranties are recognized over the life of the warranty agreement with the customer  although payment is received in full at the beginning of the agreement 
in the face of increased competition in the industry  there can be no assurance that the company will not face increased pricing pressure  which in turn could lead to changes in the selling price of the securityguard system or services furnished by the company 
the impact of any such price changes on the company s revenue or operating results cannot be accurately determined 
on june   the company acquired from fai insurances limited and certain of its subsidiaries fai insurances i the australian and new zealand security alarm operations australia and new zealand operations of fai insurances and ii the assets of fai insurances security alarm operations outside australia and new zealand which were previously purchased by fai insurances from bradley d 
cooper on march  international assets collectively  the reorganization 
pursuant to the reorganization  the company s previous existing royalty agreement with fai insurances  which provided for the payment of commissions for each securityguard system sold in exchange for the use of the fai name and logo was replaced by a no cost license agreement the license agreement with fai insurances for the continued use of the fai name and logo 
as a result of the reorganization  the company s financial statements have been prepared using the us gaap common control concept 
under this concept  the financial statements of the company include the results of operations of the company s predecessor entities operated by fai insurances ie  fai home security pty limited  fai home security enzed limited  fai home security nz trust and fai home security nz limited as if the company had owned such entities before the reorganization 
additionally  the company has included in its financial statements for the year ended june  the results for three months of operations april  june  of the international assets purchased by fai insurances on march  from bradley d

cooper

for the fiscal year ended june  interest expense was  income tax expense the effective rate of tax decreased from for the fiscal year ended june  to for the fiscal year ended june  this reduction is primarily attributable to the following factors i the introduction of income earned in the united kingdom  south africa and canada all of which have lower tax rates than australia  and ii the purchase by the company  on june   of a interest in a partnership that has entered into an agreement with prime life corporation to acquire a retirement village in melbourne  australia 
the investment in the partnership provided the company with a permanent difference for tax purposes of million approximately  after tax for the fiscal year ended june  equity in income of affiliated companies equity in income of affiliates for the fiscal year ended june  was  this was calculated by taking the company s share of ffc s net income of  for the six months ended june  and deducting amortization of goodwill for the same period of  there was no equity in income of affiliates for the fiscal year ended june  as the ffc transaction took place on december  net income net income increased from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  however  as described above  the fiscal year ended june  included related party charges of million in royalty payments  interest income of million and management fee income of million 
as adjusted to exclude these related party charges and interest income  net income increased from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  comparison of fiscal years ended june  and june  net sales 
net sales increased by million or from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  this increase was primarily due to continued growth of unit sales in the new zealand market 
net sales in the australian market increased by approximately million from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold increased by million from fiscal year to fiscal year as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold increased from for the fiscal year ended june  to for the fiscal year ended june  this increase was due  in part  to the increased cost of goods from the manufacturer for an updated version of the securityguard alarm with enhanced features  increases in commission and bonus payments to senior executives related to sales volumes and increases in royalty fees paid to related parties for use of the fai brand name 
this royalty  which was eliminated for all periods after june   increased as a percentage of revenues from for the fiscal year ended june  to for the fiscal year ended june  excluding related party expenses such as royalty charges for both periods  cost of goods sold  as a percentage of revenues  increased from of total revenue for the fiscal year ended june  to for the fiscal year ended june  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million for both the fiscal years ended june  and as a percentage of net sales  total general and administrative expenses decreased to in the fiscal year ended june  from for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease as a percentage of net sales for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june   reflects the economies of scale of operating the distributor network  since increases in net sales did not entail a proportionate increase in overhead 
furthermore  the decrease in general and administrative expenses reflects changes to the chief executive officer s employment agreement made during fiscal  which made him responsible for all costs of support staff  travel  accommodation and other expenses related to the performance of his duties as chief executive officer of the company 
for fiscal  these expenses were encompassed by the commission structure used to compensate the chief executive officer and for such period were therefore included in cost of goods sold rather than general and administrative expense 
additionally  the company received a management fee of million net of management fees paid to ffc from fai insurances in connection with the management of the international operations 
general and administrative expenses also include a charge of million for the amortization of goodwill which was expensed in the fiscal year ended june  compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  income from operations 
income from operations increased from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  if royalty payments to fai insurances for the use of the fai name and other related party charges and income were excluded for both periods  income from operations would have increased from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june interest income 
interest income was approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  this was due to the higher loan balances with a related party  ffc  during the year ended june  income tax expense 
the effective rate of tax increased from for the fiscal year ended june  to for the fiscal year ended june  this was due to the non deductibility of goodwill amortization of million during fiscal year ended june  net income 
net income increased from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  liquidity and capital resources the principal source of the company s liquidity historically has been  and in the future is expected to be  cashflow from operations

cashflow from operations increased from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase in cash flow provided by operations directly reflects the increase in profitability of the company for the fiscal year ended june  accounts receivable increased during the fiscal year ended june  as a result of the continued expansion of the distributor network in the fiscal year ended june  net cash used in investing activities decreased from a surplus of million during the fiscal year ended june  to a deficit of million during the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the following factors i payment of the first installment of million on the ffc note and an advance of million to ffc  ii purchase of additional plant and equipment of million  iii settlement of related party balances  and iv purchase  for million  of a interest in the partnership that has entered into an agreement to acquire a retirement village in melbourne  australia  as described above 
net cash generated from financing activities increased from a deficit of million during the fiscal year ended june  to a surplus of million 
this increase primarily resulted from the sale of shares in the ipo in july the company believes that internally generated cashflows will be adequate to support currently planned business operations over the next twelve months 
the company s strategy for growth is based on the expansion of its distributor network into existing and new markets  with the costs of such expansion largely borne by the distributor 
it is expected excess cashflows generated by the company will be used in part to fund the expansion of ffc s operations and if the company acquires the remaining interest of ness it will not own following the closing of the ness transaction  for such acquisition 
additionally  the company may from time to time  use excess cash flows to make strategic acquisitions or other investments 
notwithstanding that the company s costs in expanding its distributor network are expected to be limited  the company may be required to obtain additional capital to fund growth from other financing sources if the cashflow generated by the australian and new zealand operations is insufficient to meet the cash requirements of developing the international operations 
potential sources of such capital may include proceeds from bank financing or additional offerings of the equity or debt securities of the company 
there can be no assurance that such capital will be available on acceptable terms from these or other potential sources 
the lack of such capital could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s operations are concentrated outside of the united states 
accordingly  the company s financial performance could be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
as the company reports its financial results in us dollars  a significant movement in the value of the us dollar against certain international currencies  particularly the aud  could have a material adverse effect on the company s reported financial position and results of operations 
the aud has declined in value relative to the us dollar from 
on july  to 
on june  and as of september  was valued at 
as compared to the us dollar 
the change in valuation resulted in lower reported revenues than budgeted when translated into us dollars for the fiscal year ended june  the company periodically enters into forward currency exchange contracts and options to manage the risk of foreign currency fluctuations  since a significant portion of its sales are in foreign currencies 
the change in fair value of the contracts is recognized immediately and included in the determination of net income 
the company is not a trader in derivative securities  and it has not used speculative derivative products for the purpose of generating revenues earnings from changes in market conditions 
while the company is not in the business of currency hedging  it may from time to time engage in such arrangements
