factors that may affect future results the results of operations of san jose water company generally depend on the following factors regulation  surface water supply  and operation and maintenance expense 
regulation principally all the operating revenue of san jose water company results from the sale of water at rates authorized by the commission 
the commission sets rates that are intended to provide revenue sufficient to recover operating expenses and produce a reasonable return on common equity 
as a result of the commission s general rate case decision  san jose water company was authorized new rates  which became effective on july  in the decision the commission authorized an average annual rate increase of through  for a total rate increase of million during this period 
the new rates reflect an authorized return on equity of  which is within the range of recent rates of return authorized by the commission for water utilities 
the general rate case decision granted san jose water company memorandum account protection for the largely indeterminate costs associated with the new or more stringent federal water quality regulations 
with the establishment of the water quality memorandum account  any potential financial exposure resulting from these regulations has been substantially reduced 
in november  san jose water company filed an advice letter requesting an attrition rate increase in the amount of  which became effective january  surface water supply the level of surface water available in each year depends on the amount of rainfall and run off collected in san jose water company s santa cruz mountains reservoirs 
in a normal year  surface supply provides of the total water supply of the system 
surface water is a less costly source of water and its availability may significantly impact the results of operations 
operation and maintenance expense san jose water company reached an agreement with its unionized personnel covering and the agreement includes a wage increase each year and minor benefit modifications 
sjw corp 
is working to ensure that all of its data processing programs are not affected by the year challenge 
a task force has been established to assess the impact of the year on all business operations 
management expects efforts in addressing the year challenges will not have a material impact on the corporation s financial condition and results of operation 
environmental matters san jose water company s operations are subject to water quality and pollution control regulations issued by the united states environmental protection agency epa  the california department of health services and the california regional water quality control board 
the company is also subject to environmental laws and regulations administered by other state and local regulatory agencies 
under the federal safe drinking water act sdwa  san jose water company is subject to regulation by the epa of the quality of water it sells and treatment techniques it uses to make the water potable 
the epa promulgates nationally applicable maximum contaminant levels mcls for drinking water 
san jose water company is currently in compliance with all of the mcls promulgated to date 
however  the epa has continuing authority to issue additional regulations under the sdwa 
san jose water company has implemented monitoring activities and installed specific water treatment improvements enabling it to comply with all existing mcls and plan for compliance with future drinking water regulations 
in  state assembly bill no 
was signed into law requiring public water systems in california serving at least  connections to fluoridate water 
the law provides that water systems would not be required to comply unless funding for the needed capital and associated costs are available from any source other than ratepayers  shareholders  local taxpayers or bondholders of the public water system 
in addition to sdwa  other environmental regulations are becoming increasingly important 
the santa clara county toxic gas ordinance required the elimination of chlorine gas disinfection systems or the installation of complete containment systems to control accidental chlorine gas discharges 
during  san jose water company replaced the chlorine gas disinfection systems at its two water treatment plants with hypochlorinators which accomplish disinfection with liquid sodium hypochlorite 
these facilities are currently operational and in compliance with all state and local hazardous materials storage regulations 
other state and local environmental regulations apply to san jose water company s operations and facilities 
these regulations relate primarily to the handling  storage and disposal of hazardous materials 
san jose water company is currently in compliance with state and local regulations governing underground storage tanks  disposal of hazardous wastes  non point source discharges  and the warning provisions of the california safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of future drinking water regulations will most likely require increased monitoring  disinfection or other treatment of underground water supplies  more stringent performance standards for treatment plants and procedures to reduce levels of disinfection by products 
san jose water company continues to seek to establish mechanisms for recovery of government mandated environmental compliance costs 
however  currently  there are limited regulatory mechanisms and procedures available to the company for the recovery of such costs and there can be no assurance that such costs will be fully recovered 
nonregulated operations the investment in california water service group is expected to produce pre tax dividend income and cash flow of approximately  sjw land company s parking revenue is largely dependent upon the level of events and activities at the san jose arena which is located adjacent to its parking facility 
under the terms of the city of cupertino city municipal water system year lease agreement  san jose water company will be responsible for all maintenance  operating and capital costs of operating the system  while receiving all payments for water service 
water service rates will be subject to approval by the city council 
san jose water company has the approval of the city to phase in the city s water service rates to san jose water company s rates over a period of three years effective january the operating result of the lease will largely depend on the level of operation  maintenance and capital costs incurred 
impact of recent accounting pronouncement in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas no 
establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports issued to shareholders
