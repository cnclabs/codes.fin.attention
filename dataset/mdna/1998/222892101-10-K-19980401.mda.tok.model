item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following forward looking statements as such term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act are subject to the occurrence of certain contingencies which may not occur in the time frames anticipated or otherwise  and  as a result  could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements 
these contingencies include the successful completion of continuing developmental efforts under existing software contracts within anticipated time frames or otherwise  the successful negotiation  execution and implementation of anticipated new software contracts  the successful utilization of additional personnel in the marketing and technical areas  the continuing favorable responses to the company s products from existing and potential new customers  and the company s ability to complete development and sell and license its products at prices which result in sufficient revenues to realize profits 
results of operations discontinued operations during the years and  the company derived most of its revenues from providing full service automobile insurance services policy processing  policy administration and claims administration through its isd business 
the company has also provided state of the art computer products for the property casualty insurance industry through its wholly owned subsidiary  cover all 
isd revenues in and primarily consisted of policy administration and claims servicing fees from customers such as atlantic pacific employers insurance company and to a lesser extent  clarendon national insurance company clarendon  for servicing policies in the new jersey voluntary and assigned risk markets 
the contract with atlantic pacific employers insurance company reached its peak level of activity in and policy volumes declined sharply in during and  atlantic pacific employers insurance company planned to non renew all of their auto insurance policies in new jersey in accordance with the accelerated withdrawal order entered into with the new jersey department of insurance in august in addition  the mtf program had been phasing out since and  as of march   the company s contracted activity for the mtf ended 
revenues earned under the contract with clarendon involved full service policy administration and claims services for approximately percent of the assigned risk drivers in new jersey 
this activity started in with the commencement of the new jersey personal automobile insurance plan paip following the end of new jersey s direct insurance program provided by its mtf 
the company s service for clarendon was performed under new jersey s limited assignment distribution program lad which required that servicing carriers such as the company bear some of the underlying insurance risk of the policies being handled 
for this reason  the company formed a wholly owned insurance subsidiary  alerion  and effective january   alerion reinsured a portion of clarendon s insurance risk under the paip program 
by the end of  the company decided that risk taking  even as a reinsurer  was not an attractive business strategy  particularly because of the substantial capital required by its insurance subsidiary relative to other company capital commitments 
the company and clarendon agreed  therefore  to end the reinsurance arrangement in the fourth quarter of and commute all reinsurance interests and liabilities back to the inception of the agreement  thus eliminating all reinsurance activity of alerion 
this had the effect of reducing revenues by million and operating income by 
million in the fourth quarter of since the company was no longer willing to share in the underlying insurance risk of paip policies  it could not  by law  continue to provide policy administration and claims servicing to clarendon under the lad program after most of the company s insurance services contracts included a variable fee structure based on the loss ratios of the underlying insurance policies which could increase or decrease fee revenues 
the company obtained periodic independent actuarial evaluations of the loss ratios for these programs and adjusted the amount of its revenue when required 
subsequent to december   the company obtained independent actuarial projections of loss adjustment expenses expected to be incurred in and beyond with respect to the company s contractual obligations under its insurance services contracts 
as a result of this review  the company determined that its deferred contract revenues at the end of should be increased by million to adequately cover contract costs and profit margins in and beyond 
this change in accounting estimate was recorded in the fourth quarter of as a reduction of insurance services revenue 
in the fourth quarter of  isd wrote off million of unamortized capitalized software development costs previously incurred to develop a version of the cover all system for use in house to process policies and claims 
as a result of the developments discussed above  isd was suffering losses and  in addition  was operating under considerable uncertainty because of the pendency of lawsuits with certain affiliates of the robert plan corporation  a customer and subcontractor for the company 
in march  the company entered into a series of agreements resulting in the settlement and dismissal of the lawsuits and the release of the company from continuing obligations under contracts for the provision of insurance services to isd customers 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the various financial elements of those agreements 
in essence  the company no longer offers full service automobile insurance services  and its isd operations have been transferred to a subsidiary of the robert plan corporation which has replaced the company as a service provider to such customers 
these agreements have resulted in a net loss for and of  and  respectively 
the additional net loss for relates to additional loss adjustment expenses mostly legal fees  pertaining to the discontinued operations  in excess of the amount accrued in the net loss includes a provision for estimated isd losses in prior to the march  effective date of the restructuring

in october  the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants  after clearance by the fasb  issued statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
this sop supersedes sop of the same name and provides the most recent guidance on applying generally accepted accounting principles in recognizing revenue on software transactions 
sop is effective for transactions entered into in fiscal years beginning after december  sop requires that in arrangements to deliver software or a software system that does not require significant production  modification  or customization  revenue should be recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement does in fact exist  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
if the software or software system selling contract arrangement  either alone or together with other products or services  requires significant production  modification or customization construction type production type contract accounting should be used for the entire arrangement 
such accounting would recognize revenues and costs on a contract arrangement as it progresses toward completion  rather than deferred recognition of these items until persuasive evidence of delivery has occurred 
in software or software system selling arrangements that consist of multiple elements that is  additional software products  upgrades enhancements  rights to exchange or return software  postcontract customer support  or services  and contract accounting does not apply  the fee must be allocated to the various elements based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair values 
in general  if sufficient vendor specific objective evidence of fair values does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement should be deferred until such sufficient evidence exists  or until all elements have been delivered 
the principle difference between sop and its predecessor sop is in the accounting for multiple element arrangements based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair values 
cover all generally does not sell its products  classic and tas  under multiple element arrangements 
classic and tas are standard off the shelf application program packages  and while these packages may be tailored to meet customer requirements  the core package is the standard product sold 
management does not believe that sop will materially affect the way the company recognizes revenue 
there is a proposed sop dated february   which would defer for one year the provision of sop with respect to what constitutes vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for multiple element arrangements in which a software element is sold only in combination with postcontract customer support or other service elements 
for those multiple element arrangements  determination of the portion of the sales price allocable to the software element may be based on a reasonable method 
year readiness the company is aware of the issues associated with the programing code in existing computer systems as the millennium year approaches 
the year problem is pervasive and complex as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to the issue is whether computer systems will properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
the year problem creates risk for the company from unforeseen problems in its own computer systems and from third parties with whom the company deals on financial transactions 
such failures of the company and or third parties computer systems could have a material impact on the company s ability to conduct its business  and especially to process and account for the transfer of funds electronically 
the company presently believes that  with modification to existing software and converting to new software  which it has done by purchasing a year ready managerial and financial reporting system total cost estimated to be approximately  the year problem will not pose significant operational problems for the company s computer systems 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not completed timely  the year problem may have a material impact on the operations of the company 
regarding its software products held for sale  the company s tas product line already conforms to the year as of december  in  the classic product was modified to support the year
