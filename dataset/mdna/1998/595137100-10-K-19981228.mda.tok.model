microsemi repurchased  shares for  in september the company has no other significant capital commitments 
year microsemi has made and will continue to make certain investments in its equipment and business system and application software to ensure the company is year yk compliant 
the company has established a global yk team as well as local site teams to address the issues and to ensure that all aspects of its business will be yk compliant 
these teams are studying business system software and hardware  equipment and software used in the manufacturing of product  facilities  telecommunications and internal network 
the global and the local site teams consist of management as well as operational and information technology staff members 
the global yk team was formed to address company wide yk issues  such as overall project integration and management  project schedules and report to management 
local site teams address research and remediation for site specific equipment  facilities  customers  suppliers and other business partners 
the teams responsibilities include the following functional areas factory equipment and facilities  business system software  desktop computers  telecommunications system and network hardware and software systems  and customers  suppliers  and business partners 
factory equipment includes automated test equipment and test data collection systems 
the high reliability nature of the company s products calls for test  test data collection and data retention 
this need is generally called for in product performance specifications  such as mil pf microsemi is taking an inventory of factory and facility equipment to determine their yk readiness 
the company estimates this inventory will be finished and a compliance plan will be presented to management by march  a contingency plan will be presented to management by june  the initial study of the impact of the internal information system business system software has been completed and non compliant items have been identified 
approximately of the company s business software is yk compliant 
the company is in the process of installing yk compliant software for the remainder of the company 
the company is planning to complete the installation of yk compliant business system software at its five largest units by august and the remaining small units by december the company is planning to develop a contingency plan by august networking and telecommunication hardware and software are yk compliant 
the company is taking an inventory and assessing yk compliance of desktop computers 
this project should be completed by march  the company anticipates that non compliant equipment will be upgraded or replaced by june the company is currently engaged in surveying customers  suppliers  service providers and business partners  including banks and other financial institutions to determine whether they are yk compliant 
the survey is not yet complete and  accordingly  microsemi is unable to evaluate the extent to which such entities may be yk compliant and the effect that any non compliance might have 
the company anticipates cooperation in these efforts from its customers  suppliers  service providers and business partners  however  the company has no control and no assurance of their cooperation as well as their yk readiness 
microsemi is expecting to have a contingency plan for non yk compliance of its customers  suppliers  service providers and business partners by june the activities of the company s yk project teams include the development of contingency plans in the event the company and or its related third parties have not completed all remediation programs by december due to the complexity of the yk issues  there can be no assurance that such plans will be sufficient to address all internal and external failures or that unresolved or undetected yk issues will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the contingency plans  even if successful and effective  may result in loss of efficiencies  increased costs  and other adverse effects on the company s business and operations 
the company estimates that the expenses to date for the yk project have been approximately  completion of the project is expected to require an additional expenditure of  by december microsemi believes that its yk project teams will identify all of the company s material yk issues in the course of their assessments 
however  given the pervasiveness of yk issues and the complexity of and interrelationships among yk issues  both internal and external  there can be no assurance that microsemi will be able to identify and accurately evaluate all such issues 
identification of these issues is crucial to an effective remediation plan 
in the process of compiling an inventory of and developing the remediation plan for yk issues  the company may discover material undetected or unanticipated yk issues that will require substantial time and significant expense to address and that certain known issues may take longer and may be more costly to remedy 
further  any delayed or unsuccessful remediation of yk issues could result in material adverse effects on the company  such as failure to efficiently utilize manufacturing capacity  shipping delays  loss of critical data  disrupted communications  product defects  inventory write offs  waste of inventory and supplies  personal injury  difficulties in managing international operations  errors in accounting  and such indirect adverse effects as claims by third parties against the company that may relate thereto 
in addition  if yk problems experienced by any of the company s significant customers  suppliers  public utilities  service providers or business partners cause or contribute to delays or interruptions in placing orders  or in delivery of products or services to the company  or in collection of receivables  or in interruptions in the company s electrical or telecommunications utilities  such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
disruption in and throughout the global economy resulting from yk issues may have a chain reaction and could also have materially adverse affects on the company 
the company believes that such disruption is especially likely is foreign countries  including those of europe and asia  whose yk compliance programs are believed to trail those in the united states 
however  no assurance is given as to yk readiness in the united states  whose technological infrastructure is especially complex and interrelated 
the occurrence of any of the aforementioned or other the risks may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  including but not limited to such effects on the company s foreign operations 
in addition  insurance coverage for the risks described above may be unavailable or available only at prohibitive costs  and the company may be responsible itself for all of the potential adverse financial effects thereof
