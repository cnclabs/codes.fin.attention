technical support services are generally provided pursuant to multi year time and materials contracts 
revenues are recognized as costs are incurred according to predetermined rates 
the contract costs primarily include direct labor  materials and the indirect costs related to contract performance 
on april   the company acquired of the outstanding capital stock of the scientific ecology group  inc seg from westinghouse electric corporation for approximately million in cash including transaction costs and  shares of the company s common stock 
the company paid the cash portion of the purchase price out of available cash 
the acquisition of seg was effective as of april  and  accordingly  the company s results of operations for the year ended december  reflect the operating results of seg from april  the company has accounted for the transaction under the purchase method of accounting 
the aggregate purchase price of million  which includes liabilities assumed and transaction costs  exceeded the estimated fair value of seg s tangible assets by approximately million

seg  which is based in oak ridge  tennessee  is the largest commercial radioactive waste processing company in the united states  offering an extensive range of commercial waste processing services and technologies including incineration  compaction and metal decontamination and recycling to commercial generators of radioactive waste 
seg also provides transportation services for radioactive wastes  maintaining a fleet of tractors  trailers and shipping containers for transporting the wastes  and provides site decontamination and decommissioning and other technical support services to nuclear clients including government facilities  commercial facilities and university research test facilities 
commercial waste processing services are generally provided pursuant to fixed unit rate contracts and revenues are recognized as the waste is processed 
site decontamination and decommissioning and other technical support services are generally provided pursuant to time and material contracts and revenues are recognized as costs are incurred according to predetermined rates 
prior to the acquisition of seg  the company s waste treatment revenues historically had been generated from government waste processing operations pursuant to fixed price and cost plus fixed fee contracts with the united states department of energy doe 
substantially all of the company s waste treatment revenues during were derived from the doe s savannah river m area project which is a million fixed price contract 
waste treatment revenues from the doe were not significant in in march  the company decided to temporarily suspend processing of radioactive waste and initiate an unscheduled controlled cool down of its glass melter at its m area processing plant located at the doe s savannah river site as a result of observations  by operations personnel  indicating that excessive wear could be occurring on certain internal components of the melter 
after an extensive inspection of the condition of the melter at the savannah river site  the company s management made the decision to undertake more extensive repairs and modification of the facility  including melter box replacement  before resumption of radioactive waste processing 
as a result of the necessary repairs and the delay in completing the waste processing required by the contract  the company recorded a loss of million on the m area contract in the first quarter of which included the estimated costs of repairs to the melter and for estimated losses to complete the fixed price contract 
in december  the company recommenced radioactive operations and recorded an additional charge of million on the m area contract in the fourth quarter of for the estimated increased costs to complete the contract as a result of it taking longer than original estimates to bring the system to full processing throughput levels 
the company is seeking to extend the date by which it is required to complete the waste processing under the contract from the current completion date of april the company is currently negotiating an extension of the contract 
however  in the event the company is not able to obtain a contract extension  the company could incur additional losses which could be material 
the company s commercial waste processing operations also include duratherm  inc duratherm  which owns the san leon  texas thermal desorption facility  and the durachem joint venture with chem nuclear  inc duratherm commenced commercial operations in the second quarter of and the company consolidates the results of duratherm adjusting for the minority interest in consolidation 
income or loss from the company s share in durachem will be recorded by the company on the equity method

accordingly  the company announced that the durachem facility would not commence commercial operations in as previously reported 
in march  the management of chem nuclear and the company temporarily suspended construction of the project

it is the company s intention to recover these costs through additional waste treatment contracts at the savannah river facility or by dismantling the equipment and using it in other waste treatment facilities the company expects to construct throughout the united states 
the recoverability of such costs will be impacted if future operating cash flow from the additional waste treatment projects are not achieved or the equipment cannot be fully deployed on future waste treatment projects

forward looking information in response to the safe harbor provisions contained in the private securities litigation reform act of  the company is including in this annual report on form k the following cautionary statements which are intended to identify certain important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements of the company made by or on behalf of the company 
many of these factors have been discussed in prior filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the company experienced significant growth in revenues during  primarily as a result of the acquisition of seg in april the company s future operating results are largely dependent upon the company s ability to manage its commercial waste processing operations  which are formerly the operations of seg  including obtaining commercial waste processing contracts and processing the waste under such contracts in a timely and cost effective manner 
the company s future operating results are also largely dependent upon the company s ability to extend the existing contract with the doe for the savannah river m area site  complete the waste processing required by that contract without further delay and secure contracts to handle additional waste streams at that facility or deploy the equipment of future waste treatment projects 
in addition  the company s future operating results are dependent upon the timing and awarding of contracts by the doe for the cleanup of the other waste sites administered by it 
the timing and award of such contracts by the doe is directly related to the response of governmental authorities to public concerns over the treatment and disposal of radioactive  hazardous  mixed and other wastes 
the lessening of public concern in this area or other changes in the political environment could adversely affect the availability and timing of government funding for the cleanup of doe and other sites containing radioactive and mixed wastes 
additionally  revenues from technical support services have in the past and continue to account for a substantial portion of the company s revenues and loss of one or more technical support service contracts could adversely affect the company s future operating results 
the company s future operating results may fluctuate due to factors such as the timing of new commercial waste processing contracts and duration of and amount of waste to be processed pursuant to those contracts  the acceptance and implementation of the company s waste treatment technologies in the government and commercial sectors  the evaluation by the doe and commercial customers of the company s technologies versus other competing technologies as well as conventional storage and disposal alternatives  the timing of new government waste processing projects  including those pursued jointly with bnfl  the duration of such projects  and the timing of outage support projects and other large technical support services projects at its customers facilities
