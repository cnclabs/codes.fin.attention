other the approach of the year has become a potential problem for businesses utilizing computers in their operations since many computer programs are date sensitive and will only recognize the last two digits of the year  thereby recognizing the year as the year or not at all the year issue 
management has made a comprehensive assessment of the company s exposure to the year issue and what will be required to ensure that the company is year compliant 
the primary computer programs utilized in the company s operations and financial reporting systems have been acquired from independent software vendors 
all of these vendors have been formally contacted to determine whether their systems are year compliant  and  if not  timelines have been or will be established as to when the company will receive the required upgrades that assure that these systems will be year compliant 
maintenance or modification costs associated with the year issue will be expensed as incurred  while the costs of any new software will be capitalized and amortized over the software s useful life 
the company does not expect to incur costs in connection with the year issue that would have a material impact on operations 
although the company presently believes that all of its software programs will be year compliant  there can be no assurances that the company will not be adversely affected by the year issue

an additional million in expenditures for site development  construction  equipment and working capital for olinghouse has been tentatively budgeted for  as well as million for drilling and related activities at griffon  olinghouse  lookout mountain and excalibur 
the timing of these additional expenditures is dependent upon the receipt of the remaining outstanding permits and the availability of outside financing

the loan facility is to be used for site development  construction  equipment and working capital for olinghouse  as well as for the early repayment of an existing loan with bhf bank in the outstanding principal amount of approximately million 
million of the loan facility is subject to customary due diligence  definitive loan documentation and the receipt of the necessary permits at olinghouse
