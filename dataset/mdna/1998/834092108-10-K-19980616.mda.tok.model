management s discussion of results of operations for the year ended march  is based on the adjusted results of operations and the related percentages of net sales  because  in the opinion of the company  a comparison of the historical results of operations for fiscal is not meaningful due to the effects of certain transactions and non recurring charges as noted above 
fiscal year ended march  net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development expenses selling and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses operating expenses operating income interest expense  net income before provision for income taxes  minority interest and extraordinary item provision for income taxes minority interest extraordinary item net income net sales net sales were million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal  reflecting a growth of from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal using constant exchange rates  the percentage increase from fiscal to fiscal was  and from fiscal to fiscal was 
the ao acquisition  with nine months of ao net sales  amounting to million  included in fiscal net sales  had a significant impact on the net sales growth from fiscal to fiscal higher priced product growth has contributed to the company s net sales growth in fiscal and fiscal  led by the growth of spectralite r  plastic photochromic and polycarbonate products  offset in part by price and volume erosion in net sales of lower priced products 
higher priced products accounted for approximately of net lens sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal increased marketing and customer service efforts have also contributed to the growth in other higher priced products 
net sales increases by region from fiscal to were as follows north america  europe and rest of world 
net sales increases in major market areas from fiscal to were as follows north america  europe and rest of world 
at constant exchange rates  net sales increases from fiscal to fiscal were north america  europe and rest of world  and from fiscal to fiscal were north america  europe and rest of world 
gross profit and gross margin gross profit totaled million in fiscal  million  as adjusted  in fiscal and million in fiscal  reflecting growths of from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross margin in fiscal  fiscal  as adjusted and fiscal  were   and  respectively 
the gross margin has decreased in fiscal and fiscal  as ao traditionally operates at lower gross margins than sola on a stand alone basis 
in addition  the company continues to incur manufacturing start up costs in its new finished polycarbonate manufacturing operation acquired when the company purchased neolens  inc in july  and ramp up costs associated with new product offerings  such as matrix  the company s new anti reflective coating delivery system 
offsetting in part the aforementioned reductions  has been a continued shift towards higher value added products  and continued benefits from the company s cost reduction program 
during fiscal the company benefited from reduced manufacturing costs at its mexican facility arising from the weakness of the mexican peso  and from the company s cost reduction program 
the company continues to experience price competition  which can be severe in certain markets  particularly for standard products 
operating expenses operating expenses totaled million in fiscal  million  as adjusted  in fiscal and million in fiscal reflecting increases of from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal research and development expenses for fiscal  and represent  and  respectively  of annual net sales  reflecting the company s continued commitment to research and development of new products  materials and processes 
because research and development expenditure in ao as a percentage of net sales is lower than that of sola on a stand alone basis  the current lower ratio of research and development expenses to net sales can be expected for the combined company in the future 
the lower charge to research and development expenses in fiscal arose primarily from the transfer of a new product out of research and development and into production 
selling and marketing expenses were  and of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company introduced a new progressive lens design  percepta r  with a worldwide launch 
significant marketing expenditures associated with this launch were incurred primarily in the last two quarters of the fiscal year resulting in higher sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were  and  respectively

operating income for fiscal totaled million  as adjusted  an increase of million over fiscal operating income of million  or 
net interest expense net interest expense totaled million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal interest expense was higher in fiscal than fiscal  primarily due to a full year of higher indebtedness to fund the acquisitions of ao and neolens in june and july of  offset in part by lower interest rates on the company s revolving line of credit  and the repurchase of its senior subordinated notes in december interest expense was higher in fiscal than fiscal also due to the ao and neolens acquisitions  offset by the lower interest rate under the company s new bank credit facility and the reduction of debt from the proceeds of the equity public offering

in july  the company issued million shares of common stock in a public offering for which it received net proceeds of approximately million 
provision for income taxes the company s combined state  federal and foreign tax rate was approximately for fiscal compared to for fiscal  as adjusted  and for fiscal the utilization of united states valuation allowances  arising in fiscal  were the primary reasons for the lower income tax rates in fiscal and fiscal the company has deferred tax assets on its balance sheet as of march  amounting to approximately million 
the ultimate utilization of these deferred tax assets is dependent on the company s ability to generate taxable income in the future

as a result of the repurchases the company recorded extraordinary charges of million for fiscal  and million for fiscal  in each case resulting from the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and premium over accreted value  net of tax 
the repurchase was funded by borrowings under the company s credit agreement and the repurchase was partly funded by borrowings under the company s prior credit agreement and partly from cash arising from the ipo 
net income net income for fiscal totaled million compared to million  as adjusted  for fiscal and million for fiscal  increases of million and million  respectively 
the growth in net income from fiscal  as adjusted  to fiscal was and from fiscal to fiscal  as adjusted  was 
if the extraordinary items in fiscal and fiscal are excluded  the growth from fiscal  as adjusted  to fiscal  and from fiscal to fiscal  as adjusted  would have been and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources the following analysis of the company s cash flow statement reflects the historical results of the company which have not been adjusted for the ao acquisition 
operating activities generated million in cash in fiscal compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal significantly improved net income in fiscal was more than offset by increases in inventories and accounts receivable 
during fiscal the company decided to take advantage of prompt pay discounts offered by suppliers in the united states resulting in accounts payable not increasing in line with the increases in the business 
improved net income in fiscal  after adding back one time non recurring non cash charges associated with the ao acquisition  was offset in part by increases in inventories and accounts receivable 
accounts payable in fiscal increased in line with inventory growth 
during fiscal inventories as a percentage of net sales grew to from in the prior year 
the increase in inventories is primarily a result of building inventories to support new product launches  growth in higher priced products as a percentage of net sales and therefore of inventories  and the projected overall increase in the business 
during fiscal inventories as a percentage of net sales grew to if a full year s net sales for ao are used from in the prior year 
the growth in inventory levels resulted from the introduction and regional spread of new products  resulting in both finished goods inventory growth and increased mold inventory requirements

financing activities generated million in fiscal  primarily from additional borrowings under the amended agreement and exercise of stock options by employees 
in the third quarter of fiscal the company repurchased all of its remaining senior subordinated notes due the notes repurchase was funded by borrowings under the amended agreement 
in conjunction with the repurchase of its senior subordinated notes the company amended its bank credit agreement with the bank of america national trust and savings association  for itself and as agent for a syndicate of other financial institutions amended agreement 
the amended agreement increased the company s multicurrency revolving facility from million to million 
borrowings are divided into two tranches 
tranche a permits borrowings up to million in either us dollars or foreign currencies  to be used for working capital and consummating certain permitted acquisitions 
tranche b permits borrowings of up to million and can be used for working capital purposes  refinancing the term loans under the existing bank credit agreement  repurchasing the company s senior subordinated notes  and consummating certain permitted acquisitions 
the tranche a facility matures on october  and the tranche b facility matures on may  among other things the amended agreement changed certain financial covenants  removed the requirement for foreign subsidiary guarantees under the tranche a facility  increased the basket for incurring other unsecured indebtedness to million  and deleted the term facility portion 
borrowings under the tranche a and tranche b revolvers other than swing line loans  which may only be base rate loans may be made as base rate loans or libo rate loans

the company expects that the amended agreement and other overseas credit facilities  together with cash on hand and internally generated funds  if available as anticipated  will provide sufficient capital resources to finance the company s operations  fund anticipated capital expenditures  and meet interest requirements on its debt  including the notes  for the foreseeable future 
as the company s debt matures  the company may need to refinance such debt 
there can be no assurance that such debt can be refinanced on terms acceptable to the company 
currency exchange rates as a result of the company s worldwide operations  currency exchange rate fluctuations tend to affect the company s results of operations and financial position 
the two principal effects of currency exchange rates on the company s results of operations and financial position are i translation adjustments for subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency and ii translation adjustments for subsidiaries in hyper inflationary countries 
translation adjustments for functional local currencies have been made to shareholders equity 
for the fiscal years ended march   and such translation adjustments were approximately million  million  million  respectively 
during fiscal the company benefited from reduced manufacturing costs at its mexican facility arising from the weakness of the mexican peso 
for translation adjustments of the company s subsidiaries operating in hyper inflationary countries  until recently primarily brazil  the functional currency is determined to be the us dollar  and therefore all translation adjustments are reflected in the company s statements of operations 
commencing with the fourth quarter of fiscal the company s operations in mexico have been accounted for as hyper inflationary economies 
in hyper inflationary environments  the company generally protects margins by methods which include increasing prices monthly at a rate appropriate to cover anticipated inflation  compounding interest charges on sales invoices daily and holding cash balances in us dollar denominated accounts where possible 
because a majority of the company s debt is us dollar denominated  the company may hedge against certain currency fluctuations by entering into currency swaps however certain currencies  such as the brazilian real  cannot be hedged  although no such swaps had been entered into as of march  as of march  certain of the company s foreign subsidiaries had entered into forward contracts for intercompany purchase commitments in amounts other than their home currency 
the carrying amount of the forward contracts approximates fair value  which has been estimated based on current exchange rates 
for further financial data of the company s performance by region  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
seasonality the company s business is somewhat seasonal  with third quarter results generally weaker than the other three quarters as a result of lower sales during the holiday season  and fourth quarter results generally the strongest 
inflation inflation continues to affect the cost of the goods and services used by the company 
the competitive environment in many markets limits the company s ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices  and the company is subject to price erosion in many of its standard product lines 
the company seeks to mitigate the adverse effects of inflation through cost containment and productivity and manufacturing process improvements 
for a description of the effects of inflation on the company s reported revenues and profits and the measures taken by the company in response to inflationary conditions  see currency exchange rates above 
year the company has developed preliminary plans to address the possible exposures related to the impact on its computer systems of the year key financial  information and operational systems have been assessed and plans have been developed to address systems modifications required by december  based on work to date  and assuming that project plans  which continue to evolve  can be implemented as planned  management believes the financial impact of making the required systems changes will not be material to the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the company is also in the preliminary stages of assessing the possible effects on the company s operations of the year readiness of key suppliers and customers 
the company s reliance on suppliers and customers and therefore on the proper functioning of their information systems and software  means that failure to address year issues could have a material impact on the company s operations and financial results  however  the potential impact and related costs are not known at this time
