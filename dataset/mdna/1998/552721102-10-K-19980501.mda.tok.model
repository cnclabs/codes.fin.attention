the company has benefitted from continuing efforts to have its leak detection and location systems and secondary containment piping systems included as part of the customers original specifications for an increasing number of construction projects 
although demand for the company s secondary containment piping system products is generally affected by its customers need to comply with governmental regulations  purchases of such products at times may be delayed by customers due to adverse economic factors

large orders are generally highly competitive and result in lower profit margins 
in  and  no customer accounted for percent or more of the company s cooling products net sales 
although the accounts of the industrial process cooling equipment business were not included in the accounts of the company prior to december   the following pro forma information is presented to help the reader understand this business 
industrial process cooling equipment business in thousands increase pro forma decrease net sales    gross margins    as a percentage of net sales income from operations   as a percentage of net sales compared to net sales increased percent to  in from  in  resulting from higher sales across all product lines  especially tanks and central chiller systems

commission expenses were included in cost of sales in selling expenses increased from  to  and from percent to percent of net sales 
the increase was due primarily to classifying the commission expenses of  described above as selling expenses in rather than cost of sales as in general and administrative expenses increased from  to  and from percent to percent of net sales  due primarily to increased engineering sales support expenses and to the  provision for lawsuits described above 
general corporate expenses general corporate expenses include general and administrative expense not allocated to business segments and interest expense 
compared to general and administrative expenses not allocated to business segments increased from  in to  in  primarily due to the expense of supporting the industrial process cooling equipment business acquired in the midwesco merger for the entire year of such expenses were included in the pro forma results of operations of the industrial process cooling equipment business 
interest expense was  in  compared to  in  mainly because of higher borrowings to finance working capital  fixed asset additions  and the acquisition of tdc and the inclusion of the debt acquired in the midwesco merger for the full year in see also liquidity and capital resources 
compared to general and administrative expenses not allocated to business segments increased from  to  due primarily to increased profit based incentive compensation  expenses of upgrading the company s computer hardware and software  and higher administrative  financial management and accounting salaries expense 
the increased administrative  financial management and accounting salaries expenses reflect shifts in time devoted to corporate administrative matters from other areas  with some offsetting decrease in perma pipe administrative expense 
the december   acquisition of midwesco had a minimal effect on general corporate expenses 
interest expense increased from  to  due primarily to higher borrowings to finance working capital  fixed asset acquisitions  the acquisition of sze hagenuk  and the purchase of real estate to provide for the expansion of midwesco filter in winchester  virginia 
liquidity and capital resources on september   and october   respectively  midwesco filter and perma pipe received the proceeds of industrial revenue bonds 
such proceeds are available for capital expenditures related to manufacturing capacity expansions and efficiency improvements during a three year period commencing in the fourth quarter of in the filtration products business in winchester  virginia  and the piping systems products business in lebanon  tennessee 
the bonds bear interest at a variable rate  which initially approximated five percent per annum  including letters of credit and remarketing fees 
each bond indenture establishes a trusteed project fund for deposit of the bond proceeds 
the trustee is authorized to make disbursements from the project fund upon requisition from the company to pay costs of capital expenditures which comply with the requirements of the loan agreement for each bond 
pending such disbursements  the trustee invests the balance of the project fund in investments defined by the indenture and limited by applicable law 
such invested funds totaled  at january  the bonds are fully secured by bank letters of credit which expire approximately two years from the date of issuance  the company expects to arrange for renewal  reissuance or extension of the letters of credit prior to expiration 
on may   the company purchased for approximately million a acre parcel of land with a  square foot building adjacent to its midwesco filter property in winchester  virginia 
the purchase was financed by a seven year mortgage bearing interest at and by the industrial revenue bonds described above 
at january   a capacity expansion project at the lebanon  tennessee piping systems manufacturing facility was essentially complete 
this project was primarily financed from the proceeds of the tennessee industrial revenue bonds 
the company has a positive working capital of million and a current ratio of to at january  working capital and investment needs of the company have historically been funded through the company s operations and a revolving line of credit 
to finance the september acquisition of ricwil piping systems company  the company borrowed  from a bank under a term loan 
the company assumed approximately  of midwesco  inc long term debt in the midwesco merger   of which represented assumed bank and other debt  with the remainder representing assumed capitalized lease obligations 
effective december   the company replaced its revolving line of credit and the unpaid portion of the  september term loan with million of fixed rate senior unsecured notes due the notes and a new million floating rate unsecured revolving line of credit 
proceeds of the notes were also used to repay the midwesco  inc debt assumed by the company 
the notes bear interest at an annual rate of and require principal payment beginning in the year ended january   and continuing annually thereafter  resulting in a seven year average life 
during  the terms of the unsecured credit agreement were amended 
under the terms of the agreement as amended  the company may borrow up to  under a revolving line of credit which matures on march  interest rates are based on one of two options selected by the company at the time of each borrowing the prime rate or the libor rate plus a margin for the term of the loan 
at january   the prime rate was percent and the margin added to the libor rate  which is redetermined each quarter based on the company s interest coverage ratio  was percent 
the company had borrowed  under the revolving line of credit at january  additionally   was drawn under the agreement as letters of credit principally to guarantee performance to third parties resulting from various trade activities 
the loan agreement contains certain financial covenants 
as of january   the company was not in compliance with one such financial covenant 
the company has obtained a waiver for such non compliance 
year certain computer systems with date sensitive programs may not properly recognize the year and may  as a result  create unreliable data or fail to operate at all in the year and thereafter 
such occurrences could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
accordingly  the company is assessing its financial and operating systems for the presence of such deficiencies and is developing and executing detailed corrective plans 
the company is also communicating with significant suppliers of goods and services and with customers to assess its exposure to their potential year issues 
finally  the company is assessing its products for the presence of technology which might adversely affect those products and the customers to whom they have been delivered 
although there can be no assurances  based on current assessments  management expects the company s year issues to be identified and corrected before the year  and does not expect the costs of correction to have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition
