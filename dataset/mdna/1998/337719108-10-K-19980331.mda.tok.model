overview the company designs  manufactures and markets specialty and general purpose medical imaging systems for the diagnosis and treatment of disease 
the company s newest products are directed towards medical specialties in which image guided  minimally invasive therapies are replacing open surgical procedures 
these products are used primarily in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer  heart disease and vascular disease 
the company also designs and manufactures specialty x ray imaging components and subsystems for several leading medical product companies as an oem and sells general radiology systems for use in hospitals  clinics and physicians offices 
the company experienced significant losses during the second half of and during the company cannot predict when it will return to profitability  although it has taken significant steps to reduce costs and improve sales during including the distribution partnership  announced in october  with ethicon endo surgery for the marketing and sale of mammotest breast biopsy systems 
improvement in the company s results of operations will depend on many factors  including demand for the company s products and the ability of the company to maintain or increase gross margins  control manufacturing and other costs  effectively transfer production from the company s addison  illinois manufacturing facility  enter into and effectively implement distribution arrangements for its mammotest and other products  implement its marketing and sales strategies in the united states and internationally  maintain orders under oem agreements  renew oem agreements on favorable terms and develop and introduce new products that compete successfully 
the company believes that improving factory utilization will be a key factor in returning to acceptable levels of profitability 
as a means of reducing its overall manufacturing costs  the company announced  in the third quarter of  its intention to close its addison  illinois manufacturing facility and outsource or transfer addison production 
accordingly  the company recorded a million restructuring provision in the third quarter  for the anticipated shortfall between required lease payments and estimated sublease payments during the facility s remaining lease term which runs through june  estimated facility closing costs  severance  and certain other non recurring costs associated with this decision 
the company expects that the addison closure will be completed in the near future  although no assurance can be given to that effect 
the company has experienced and is likely to continue to experience significant quarterly and annual fluctuations in revenues  operating results and net income  depending on such factors as the timing of large system shipments  the timing of orders under oem contracts and related manufacturing and shipment scheduling  new product introductions and new marketing programs by the company and its competitors  delays in development projects  the effect of economic conditions on the company s markets  the effects of managed healthcare on capital expenditures and reimbursement  increases in marketing  research  and other costs in relation to sales  regulatory clearance of new products  seasonal purchasing patterns of hospitals and the timing of purchasing decisions by customers 
additionally  because the timing of the occurrence of such factors is difficult to anticipate and many of the company s costs are fixed  the company may not be able to sufficiently reduce its costs in periods when its revenues are less than anticipated and may suffer unexpected losses or lower income in these periods 
the company continues to attempt to expand its international sales and marketing efforts  which can be expected to result in losses from its international operations until its international revenues reach sufficient levels 
additionally  the company s exposure to foreign currency and other risks of international business may increase as its international business grows 
the company attempts to minimize these risks through measures including  but not limited to  generally requiring payments in us dollars and using letters of credit 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be successful in its international sales efforts or in minimizing any associated risks 
the company experienced a decline in revenues from customers outside the united states in the company s sales of its mammotest breast biopsy systems were lower in as compared to  although mammotest sales during the second half of were higher than the comparable six month period of the company continues to face aggressive and successful competition within the surgical stereotactic core needle breast biopsy market from us surgical corporation 
in october  the company entered into a marketing partnership with ethicon endo surgery that it believes will help it more adequately address this market 
in november  the company entered into an alliance with sterling diagnostic imaging  inc  under which the company will develop specific digital radiographic systems  utilizing sterling s directray tm digital image detector technology 
if the ethicon endosurgery and sterling strategic alliances produce a significant increase in demand for the company s products and the company is able to meet the resultant product demand  the company s revenue could increase appreciably  although no assurance can be given to that effect 
see business strategic alliances 
year the company utilizes software and related technologies within its products and in their development and manufacture that may be impacted by the year the year issue exists because many computer systems and applications currently use two digit date fields to designate a year 
date sensitive systems may recognize the year as  or not at all 
this inability to properly treat the year could cause systems to process critical financial and operational information incorrectly 
the company is expected to incur expenditures over the next two years to address this issue 
the company has completed its initial assessment of all currently supported products  and has concluded that only a limited number of its products will be affected 
necessary modifications are not expected to have a material financial impact on the company 
the company continues to assess the impact of the year on its internal operating software and systems  and the related costs of modifications 
this assessment is on going  therefore  a detailed plan of action for addressing any issues which will arise from this review has not yet been developed 
accordingly  although the company does not expect the costs of any required modifications will be material to the consolidated financial statements  no assurance to that effect can be given
