quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company  as a result of its global operating and financial activities  is exposed to changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial position 
in seeking to minimize the risks and or costs associated with such activities  the company manages exposures to changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates through its regular operating and financing activities 
pursuant to company policy  foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge certain firm commitments and the currency risk inherent in the deposit taking and lending activities of the company s international treasury center 
option and futures contracts are used to mitigate the company s risk to fluctuating commodity prices 
the company s exposure to changes in interest rates results from its investing and borrowing activities used to meet its liquidity needs 
long term debt is generally used to finance long term investments  while short term debt is used to meet working capital requirements 
derivative instruments are not presently used to adjust the company s interest rate risk profile 
the company does not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes  nor does it utilize leveraged financial instruments 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities and less so through investments in marketable securities 
the company utilizes us dollar denominated commercial paper and borrowings as well as foreign currency denominated borrowings to fund its working capital and investment needs 
the majority of short and long term borrowings and marketable securities are in fixed rate instruments 
there is inherent roll over risk for borrowings and marketable securities as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
using a yield to maturity analysis and assuming an increase in interest rates of basis points about movement in interest rates with the december  level of debt and marketable securities  the potential decrease in fair value of marketable securities  short term and long term borrowings would be million  million and million  respectively 
the majority of foreign currency forward contracts are denominated in australian  french  german  irish  spanish and british currencies 
the magnitude and nature of such hedging activities are explained further in note  financial instruments  on page assuming a increase in foreign currency exchange rates of currencies sold  the company could incur a million loss on foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at december  such losses would be substantially offset by gains from the revaluation or settlement of the underlying positions hedged 
the company has entered into silver option and futures contracts to minimize its exposure to increases in silver price in silver price risk for was not hedged 
as of december   the company had hedged approximately of its planned silver requirements for using broker quoted termination values and assuming a decrease in silver price from per troy ounce at december   the decrease in fair value of silver options and futures would be million 
such losses in fair value  if realized  would be offset by lower costs of silver containing products manufactured during
