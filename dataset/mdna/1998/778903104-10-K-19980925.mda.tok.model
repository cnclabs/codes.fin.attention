operations net sales were  in fiscal which fell below fiscal net sales of  fiscal was transitional year for the company as it endured difficult market conditions while continuing its internal efforts to increase manufacturing capabilities  promote efficient operations and restructure and build its marketing functions 
following fiscal s stellar increase in custom molded sales  the company reported a drop in this category 
as such  during fiscal this reduction accounted for the majority of the loss in sales volumes in the current period 
the company s markets have been unpredictable over the last few years and has caused the company to readily adapt itself to always take the utmost advantage of the current economic and market conditions we operate in 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company began to see improvements in the marketplace 
this coupled with the rotocast merger resulted in improved sales volumes in the fourth quarter of fiscal sales volumes increased approximately to  for the three months ended june  compared to the same period last year 
sales from the recently merged rotocast divisions accounted for of the company s net sales in fiscal net sales increased  or to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the majority of the company s product lines sustained relatively level sales volumes as compared to fiscal with the increased volumes related directly to increases in marine  custom molded products and customer tooling 
custom molded products reported an impressive increase over prior year volumes 
management attributes this gain to its experienced sales engineering staff s ability to expand the company s marketshare of these products 
during the last several years the company has also capitalized on the roto molding industry s overall expanding marketplace for its products 
in fiscal  we experienced a lackluster marketplace due to volatile resin prices and then what appeared to be a return of consumer confidence in fiscal however  certain analysts in the industry have indicated that the industry appears to have reached a temporary plateau 
management continues to watch these trends to ascertain what impact it will have on the company s growth projections 
cost of goods was  or of net sales in fiscal compared to  or and  or of net sales in fiscal and since fiscal  the roto molding industry has experienced extreme volatility in plastic resin prices 
these price increases have resulted in substantial increases in raw material prices per pound since the beginning of this four year period 
the price increases were enacted by the various resin suppliers in response to domestic and foreign material demands as well as various natural and internal disasters experienced by the resin suppliers 
the cost of plastic resin represents a significant portion of the company s manufacturing costs and has continually challenged the company to effectively mitigate these increases 
since fiscal  the company was relatively successful in mitigating these resin price increases by initiating customer price increases and various raw material purchasing strategies 
in fiscal  the company also benefited from increased volumes of custom molded products 
pricing structures for custom molded products typically follow market trends and allow the company to obtain gross margin levels consistent with company objectives 
however  due to fiscal s adverse market conditions which resulted in the reduction in fiscal sales volumes coupled with high resin prices during the majority of the year  the company was unable to maintain consistent operating results 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  management began to see more favorable trends in resin prices 
as these trends continue into fiscal  management is optimistic about improved gross profit margins 
management will continue to monitor these trends and their affect on the marketplace to maximize any obtainable benefits 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  management also consolidated two of its manufacturing locations into its remaining ten locations 
these restructuring efforts should have a positive impact on gross margins during future periods due to the elimination of the fixed overhead costs associated with the closed facilities 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  or of net sales in fiscal compared to  or of net sales in fiscal the increase relative to net sales is attributed to the decrease in sales volumes during the first three quarters of fiscal plus the additional expenses related to the rotocast operations approximately million which was incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal since the rotocast merger  management has focused its efforts on restructuring sales and administrative functions at these facilities 
these efforts coupled with the plant consolidations mentioned above should result in necessary cost reductions to bring sg a costs in synch with future sales volumes and management s objectives 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  or of net sales in fiscal compared to  or of net sales in fiscal the overall decrease is primarily attributable to the increase in sales volumes and management s ability to keep these costs in synch with the current sales volume levels 
management continued the restructuring of its sales engineering staff in fiscal the changes enacted have had a positive impact on the company s sales growth with a minimal impact to increased selling costs 
the company continues to benefit from the operating efficiencies realized since the completed consolidation of the illinois and wisconsin facilities 
income from operations was  or of net sales in fiscal compared to  or and  or of net sales in fiscal and again  current year operations were effected by sluggish sales volumes  high resin prices and the additional sg a costs related to the rotocast operations 
management perceives some indication within the industry to move beyond its previous sales plateau 
this potential improvement in market conditions coupled with favorable resin costs and the cost savings related to the recent plant consolidations should improve future operating results 
however  if resin prices do not remain stable and the marketplace reacts adversely to current domestic and foreign economic conditions which have recently arisen  these factors could adversely effect the company s ability to meet future operating objectives 
interest expense increased  to  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal the increase is primarily attributed to an increase in the company s debt structure when compared to the same period last year 
the increase in the company s debt structure is attributed to the colorado facility purchase and its subsequent improvements in the later part of fiscal and during fiscal approximately million  million in capital expenditures at the other company facilities in fiscal  and the additional debt issued in connection with the rotocast merger as well as the debt assumed in the transaction which together amount to approximately million 
in addition  the company has incurred an increase in short term borrowings due to a decrease in cash flows from operations 
interest expense decreased  to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the decrease is attributed to reductions in the company s overall debt structure during the first half of fiscal coupled with stable interest rates during the majority of the year and the company s extensive use of optional bank libor interest rates 
during later part of fiscal  the company made significant machinery and equipment purchases and purchased a acre facility in commerce city  colorado to expand and relocate its colorado operations 
these expenditures set the stage for the company s future growth and were funded by operating cash flows and the issuance of additional bank financing 
the later has increased the company s overall debt structure by approximately  at fiscal year end and which resulted in additional interest costs in fiscal net income was  or 
per common share in fiscal compared to  or 
per common share in fiscal the decrease is directly related to the reduction in sales volume levels which impeded the preservation of the company s gross margin goals coupled with the increases in sg a and interest expenses outlined above 
as we look forward  management is extremely pleased with the benefits which will result from the rotocast merger and the consolidation of two of its operating divisions in fiscal the rotocast merger has provided the company a unique opportunity to capitalize on expanding its marketshare with the newly acquired product lines and distribution channels as well as the cost savings obtainable by combining various manufacturing  sales and administrative functions 
net income remained relatively consistent at  or 
per common share in fiscal compared to  or 
per common share in fiscal although consistent with prior year  the company s results included costs of  or 
per common share related to litigation settlement expenses see note of notes to financial statements 
total litigation costs represent an out of court settlement of  plus additional legal costs of  liquidity and capital resources working capital increased  to  at june  compared to  at june  the increase is primarily related to the inclusion of rotocast s net current assets as of june   net of normal fluctuations in accounts receivables and accounts payables  an increase in inventories related to raw material purchasing strategies and an increase in the current portion of long term debt related to additional machinery and equipment financing 
cash provided by operations was  for fiscal which reflected a decrease of  in relation to prior period results 
the reduction is primarily attributed to the lower sales volume levels reported in the current period which resulted in a decrease in net income of approximately million  as well as a decrease in accounts payable and increases in accounts receivable and inventories  as indicated above  which increased cash used by operating activities by  the company expended a total of  for property  plant and equipment during fiscal compared to  for fiscal the decrease over prior year is directly related to the costs incurred to purchase the commerce city  colorado facility 
the company continued to complete its internal expansion project that it began in fiscal during the current period the company acquired two additional roto molding machines for its idaho facility  cnc routers for its chicago  nevada and idaho facilities  as well as resin silo projects in florida and colorado 
the company has also substantially completed its building improvement project at its new commerce city  colorado facility 
the company will continue its internal expansion project in fiscal as it determines the additional requirements associated with the rotocast operations 
this commitment has allowed the company to stay in the forefront of the industry and optimizes our position for future growth 
in january  the company advanced  on its fourth machinery and equipment term loan commitment with wells fargo bank 
the proceeds were used to repay amounts originally borrowed under the company s revolving line of credit to finance  in machinery and equipment purchases 
the note is due in monthly interest only payments through november   at which time it will convert to a sixty month fully amortizable note 
in connection with the rotocast merger  the company issued a eighteen month  note payable to the seller and also replaced rotocast s existing line of credit and term debt with a day bank note in the amount of  the note to the seller is payable with one interest only payment due march  and second principal and interest payment due upon maturity on september  the  note is secured by an irrevocable standby letter of credit which can only be called upon if the principal balance is not paid within days of maturity 
in april  the bank increased the company s total loan facility to million 
this was done in conjunction with an appraisal of rotocast s fixed assets 
the ninety day note which was issued to retire rotocast s existing debt was replaced with a  sixty month fully amortizable note payable and then in july  the note was increased to  the note is payable in monthly principal payments of  plus interest and will mature on july  also  in july  the bank replaced the company s existing real estate loan with a new  loan secured by the company s bensenville  illinois and gainesville  texas properties 
the note will be due in monthly principal payments of approximately  plus interest on a twenty five year amortization with the outstanding principal due on july  the other major change to the company s total debt structure with the bank was an increase to the total principal available on the company s line of credit from million to million which is also inclusive of a million subfeature for the issuance of a standby letter of credit securing the note payable due to the seller of rotocast 
the maturity date of the line of credit was extended to october  in addition  the bank reduced the libor interest rate spread from down to and made this option available on all bank borrowings 
net borrowings under the line of credit increased million to million between june  and june  current increases in the line balance are related to a combination of the ongoing capital expenditures  including the building improvements in commerce city  colorado  payments made during the year in connection with the bonar litigation settlement  the fiscal common stock dividend payment and an increased reliance on the line of credit due to the reduction in income from operations 
at june   the company had approximately million available for future borrowings under the line of credit 
the remaining  open on the line of credit is reserved for the letter of credit which was issued to secure the gsc note payable 
with the advances on the additional long term debt in july the available borrowings under the line of credit will increase by an additional million 
effective july   the company initiated an interest rate swap agreement with the bank 
the agreement will allow the company to fix a portion of its outstanding term and line of credit debt from a variable floating rate to a fixed interest rate in efforts to hedge against future increases in the bank s prime rate 
the agreement matures july  stockholder s equity increased  to  in fiscal and since fiscal stockholder s equity has more than doubled 
this increase includes the effect of the rotocast merger net of the company s third annual common stock dividend of 
per common share  or  which was declared on december  and paid on january  to stockholders of record on january  in fiscal  the company initiated and completed a common stock buy back program which resulted in the repurchase and subsequent retirement of  shares of common stock at a cost of  on april   the company was named as a defendant in a complaint filed by bonar us  inc in delaware superior court

the settlement involved mutual general releases by the parties  dismissals of the actions brought by the parties and payments to bonar of  in march and  in september the  payment had been previously accrued for and was included in accounts payable in the accompanying june  balance sheet 
cash flows from operations in conjunction with the company s revolving line of credit and machinery and equipment loan commitment are expected to meet the company s needs for working capital  capital expenditures and repayment of long term debt for the foreseeable future 
year management has been fully apprised of the issues surrounding the year dilemma 
in assessing the potential impact this issue has on the company  management reviewed both its manufacturing and accounting systems to ascertain critical applications which would be affected 
due to the nature of the company s manufacturing process and the equipment utilized  it was determined that even equipment which was operated or incorporated computerized controls or programs were not dependent on calendar functions to operate and thus would not be impacted by the year problem 
as part of the year issue the company also assessed compliance of its network computing systems 
to date the company believes that all of its operating divisions except one are compliant 
the remaining site along with the company s corporate division has resolved to make the necessary hardware and software enhancements to become compliant at this final site by the end of fiscal june  
the company does not believe it will encounter any problems associated with the year issue between now and such time that it completes the necessary upgrades to is computer systems 
the costs associated with becoming compliant will not have a material effect to the company s financial position 
to complete the company s assessment of the year problem  the company will be contacting its major suppliers to ascertain their readiness and ability to function beyond this critical date and what impact  if any  it will have on the company s ability to continue normal operations
