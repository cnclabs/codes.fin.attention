the company believes that legacy forged tm is uniquely positioned due to the strength and sharpness of the blade which results from a drop forged manufacturing process and a sharper blade angle than the competition 
another competitive advantage in favor of legacy forged tm is the hybrid material used to make the handle

an interruption in supply from any one of the suppliers could have an adverse impact on the company s ability to fill orders on a timely basis
