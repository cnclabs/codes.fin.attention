enhanced calling suite 
the company refers to its enhanced calling suite as lydian tm 
in a typical lydian calling card installation  the carrier would ask their calling card customers to dial a toll free number or in the united states  standards vary per country internationally and enter a secured personal identification number pin to make calls 
these toll free calls would be routed to a lydian platform where the pin would be processed and the customer would be allowed to make outgoing calls 
typically  calling card users are billed at month end for all of the usage they incur during the month 
lydian also supports prepaid calling for callers with limited credit associated with specific pins 
these prepaid customers pay in advance for long distance calling  and they are allowed to use their account until the advance payment is exhausted 
the lydian prepaid calling card application is available to wireline and wireless telecommunications companies

component technologies underlying all of these products are telephony platforms that have three key components applications  middleware  and hardware 
applications are software programs that provide specific product capabilities such as prepaid calling features  from basic telephony building blocks provided by the middleware 
the middleware is a software layer between the applications and the underlying computer operating system 
middleware adds telephony features  such as switch control  to these operating systems 
the hardware  and its associated operating system  are industry standard  non proprietary solutions from third parties 
this underlying platform infrastructure can be illustrated through the use of an example 
the table below shows a typical lydian prepaid platform 
component technologies example explanation application lydian prepaid calling software that combines basic telephony features provided by the middleware into sophisticated end user features 
for prepaid calling this includes rating  card management  and call dialogues 
middleware quickscript  betex tm esp adds basic telephony features  such as switch control  to an industry standard operating system  such as unix r 
hardware server the tandem nsk  or unix computer  that runs the software middleware and application 
the software is the brains that tells the other components what to do 
vicorp voice response units provides interactivity with the user  stores voice prompts  and recognizes user key strokes 
programmable switch server connects platform to the telephone network 
middleware components middleware adds telephony control features to the basic features provided by industry standard operating systems and hardware 
the company uses several different variations of its middleware depending on the exact needs of the customer and the application 
the company s middleware solution is its betex tm enhanced services platform esp 
the betex esp middleware provides application processing functions  controls matrix switch resources  and controls voice media resources in a service node architecture 
middleware software includes network and device driver layers  an open application programming interface  and a sql database for storing service data such as application scripts and user profiles 
the betex esp platform offers o a co processing architecture supporting scalable  modular growth o the ability to run multiple services on a common software and hardware platform o support for integrated voice  data  and multimedia applications o the ability to develop and integrate advanced consumer features with advanced customer service interfaces using a single service creation environment o support for more than different languages o support for ss  isdn national and international standards  e  t  and r signalling betex esp applications are built using quickscript  a graphical service creation environment for building applications and creating automated call dialogues 
quickscript s capabilities can be easily expanded using c or c to write custom quickscript icons 
quickscript allows for prototyping and rapid application development of betex esp services 
the company s lydian enhanced calling suite and the vaccs call center solution were both built using quickscript 
customers using these products often utilize quickscript to build customized versions of the products 
the customers can perform the customization themselves  but in many cases they rely on the company s integration and development expertise to build the final application 
customers also use the company s middleware as a starting point for creating their own applications 
some of these customers rely on the company s application and telephony expertise to build their custom applications 
others purchase the company s middleware and build the applications themselves 
the company s uniport r middleware product provides an environment for creating a multi application call processing platform that can be integrated into existing telephony networks 
using uniport  the company s customers can build applications using an application programming interface 
hardware components in addition to applications and middleware  the third component to the company s platforms is the hardware 
the hardware has three elements a telephony network interface  voice response units vrus  and a server 
the telephony network interface in many of the company s applications is provided by a programmable switch from either summa four or excel switching 
this switch provides highly reliable  large scale interconnections at a cost effective price point 
however  as circumstances require  the company utilizes vrus to connect directly to the network  or develops interfaces for connecting to a customer s existing switch hardware 
the vrus  which are produced by the company  provide many of the enhanced features of the company s solution platforms 
they play and record prompts  detect dtmf tones  and can even receive send faxes or perform voice recognition 
the vrus incorporate industry standard hardware  including pentium processors and standard backplanes 
the company s vrus are available in high availability configurations that include redundant  hot pluggable power supplies and disk drives 
the servers in the company s platforms run the actual application code 
they contain the instructions that tell the programmable network interfaces and vrus what to do what prompts to play  when to record input from callers  and where to route the calls 
they can also act as application processors 
the exact configuration depends upon the demand of the application 
the company supports servers that run unix and fault tolerant servers  such as nonstop servers from tandem 
markets the market for the company s products has grown primarily due to worldwide changes in the telecommunications industry 
these changes include legislative reforms  mergers  acquisitions  alliances  and a convergence of previously segmented technologies 
the global trends in telecommunications continue to promote the use of enhanced services as a way for companies to differentiate themselves from competition and possibly generate additional revenue

the company also pursued opportunities for additional growth through acquisitions and or strategic investments 
the company acquired vicorp and bfd during since the vicorp and bfd acquisitions were accounted for as purchases  the company s statements of operations include the operations of vicorp since its acquisition date in april  and the operations of bfd since its acquisition date in october therefore  the company s past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indication of future performance 
a number of uncertainties exist that could have an impact on the company s future operating results  and financial condition including o the company competes in an industry marked by frequent technological changes which will force the company to expend funds to develop new products and implement new technologies 
o the various markets into which the company sells its products are undergoing significant changes with increasing demands for product innovations 
o the company must be successful in competing against many competitors  many of which have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  and sales resources than the company 
o the company will be required to properly estimate costs under fixed price contracts 
o increased risk of litigation in the company s industry resulting from aggressive prosecutions of intellectual property claims 
o the company s ability to retain its larger customers  including mci 
o availability of certain hardware and software components which are incorporated with the company s products and are purchased from a limited number of vendors 
o the company s ability to hire and retain qualified personnel 
o legislative changes affecting the company s markets  including the telecommunications act of o given the company s acquisition of vicorp and its large presence in international markets  regulatory  monetary and inflationary factors can negatively impact the company s operations in the future 
o the company s reliance on large sales orders that increase the risk of significant revenue fluctuations  from quarter to quarter and year to year 
o the company s ability to generate sufficient cash  from operations or from external sources  to fund its global operations 
see financial statements  including report of independent accountants 
many of such uncertainties are outside the company s control and could postpone  delay  or eliminate potential sales opportunities 
these uncertainties  therefore  can affect the company s ability to sell  deliver  and install its products in a consistent manner 
consequently  the company s past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indication of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods
