item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general integ  a development stage company  was incorporated on april  to develop the lifeguide system  a next generation  hand held glucose monitoring product for use by people with diabetes that avoids the pain and blood associated with conventional finger stick technologies 
by using the company s proprietary interstitial fluid sampling technology  the lifeguide system will allow people with diabetes to frequently self monitor their glucose levels without repeatedly enduring the pain of lancing their fingers to obtain a blood sample 
results of operations from inception through december   the company has incurred losses totaling  consisting of  of research and development expenses   of general and administrative expenses   of manufacturing development expenses and  of other expenses net of interest income

the company has generated no revenue and has sustained significant operating losses each year since inception 
the company expects such losses to continue for the next several years 
the company s future success is entirely dependent upon the successful development  commercialization and market acceptance of the lifeguide system  the development of which is ongoing and the complete efficacy of which has not yet been demonstrated 
the company is currently focused on the research and development activities necessary to modify the current design in order for the lifeguide system to meet the company s product specifications 
in addition to the engineering effort required to identify and resolve the remaining design issues in the lifeguide meter  the company is pursuing parallel efforts to prepare the entire lifeguide system for high volume manufacturing

in  the company expects to focus its resources on resolving the remaining technical issues in order for the lifeguide system to meet its required specifications 
as a result of the uncertain nature of developing a product of this type  the company is not able to estimate how long it will take to achieve the required performance level of the lifeguide system 
the company expects to continue to use cash at a rate between million and million per quarter until such time as it resolves these remaining technical issues 
the company believes that  at this rate of spending  its current cash balances  when combined with the million unused portion of its line of credit facility  will be sufficient to fund its operations through approximately the third quarter of however  the company expects that if it is successful at resolving the above mentioned technical issues  the use of cash for operations and capital equipment investments will increase substantially as it prepares for clinical trials and the market launch of the lifeguide system
