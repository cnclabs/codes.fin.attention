item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview during  the company experienced record sales and earnings results  primarily due to the inclusion of sales and earnings of companies acquired by reliance during and the company experienced pricing pressures for some of its products  particularly non ferrous and stainless steel products 
sales prices to customers for those products decreased because of the lower costs of those materials 
however  the company was able to somewhat offset these declining sales prices with increased sales prices for heat treated aluminum products and certain structural steel products during there was a significant demand and a restricted supply for heat treated aluminum by the aerospace industry in  allowing higher prices to be realized on the sales of these products 
the supply and demand levels for heat treated aluminum products are expected to continue through at least the first half of in addition  as a result of certain of the company s acquisitions during  the product mix shifted to a larger percentage of heat treated aluminum and other higher than average margin products sold as compared to the company believes its results have been less volatile to the economic trends affecting the industry because its operations are geographically diversified  it has a wide range of products  and its customer base and the industries to which it sells are highly diversified 
reliance s diversification and financial performance have benefited from several significant acquisitions during the reported periods  each of which has been immediately accretive to earnings 
additionally  the company s successful efforts to continue to expand through strategic acquisitions and to increase its efficiencies and physical capacities through capital expenditure programs have enabled it to lessen the impact of regional economic recessions on the overall results of its operations 
management believes that the company is positioned to take full advantage of improved economic environments  while at the same time it is poised to operate efficiently in less favorable economies because of its tight cost controls  high inventory turnover and diversification

the company s capital requirements are primarily for working capital  acquisitions  and capital expenditures for continued improvements in plant capacities and material handling and processing equipment 
the company s primary sources of liquidity are generally from internally generated funds from operations and the company s revolving line of credit 
on october   the company entered into a syndicated credit facility with five banks 
the company s borrowing limit under the revolving line of credit established under this agreement was increased to  prior to the syndicated line of credit  the company s line of credit with one lender had been increased to  in march the syndicated credit agreement allows the company to use up to  of the line of credit to make acquisitions

the proceeds of the debt funded in september were used to refinance the borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility made to fund the acquisitions of ami and amalco  and borrowings for general working capital purposes

the company had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of december  the company anticipates that the funds generated from operations and funds available under its line of credit will be sufficient to meet its working capital needs for the foreseeable future  including the expansion of its facilities at certain of its metals service centers currently in progress 
in december  the board of directors approved a stock repurchase plan authorizing the company to purchase up to  shares increased to  in february of its outstanding common stock 
the company had purchased a total of  shares of its common stock  at an average purchase price of per share as of december   all of which are being treated as authorized but unissued shares 
the company repurchased  of those shares during  at an average purchase price of per share 
the company believes such purchases enhance shareholder value and reflect its confidence in the long term growth potential of the company 
inflation the company s operations have not been  nor are they expected to be  materially affected by general inflation 
historically  the company has been successful in raising prices to its customers in periods of increasing metal prices and has had to reduce prices to its customers in periods of declining metal prices 
changes in metal prices  therefore  affect the company s sales and earnings 
seasonality the company recognizes that some of its customers may be in seasonal businesses  especially customers in the construction industry 
as a result of the company s geographic  product and customer diversity  however  the company s operations have not shown any material seasonal trends  although the months of november and december traditionally have been less profitable because of a reduced number of working days for shipments of the company s products and holiday closures for some of its customers 
there can be no assurance that period to period fluctuations will not occur in the future 
results of any one or more quarters are therefore not necessarily indicative of annual results 
impact of year the company does not anticipate that there would be a material impact on the results of operations or cash flows of the company related to the year issue 
the year issue addresses computer programs which have time sensitive software that recognizes a date using as the year rather than the year most of the company s locations are converting to a new computer system that has been certified year compliant by the company s software vendor 
in addition to the vendor s certification  the company has an ongoing program to test its systems for such compliance 
this conversion began in and has been progressing on schedule 
the final conversions are scheduled to occur in june  which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
a training staff was hired in and has been solely dedicated to this conversion project 
at the company s locations that are not being converted to this system  assessments of the existing systems have occurred 
the company  working with its respective software vendors  has adopted plans to make the minor modifications required to address the year issue at these locations 
the major business systems of the company are not vulnerable to third parties failure to remediate their own year issues  as the company s interface with third parties  including customers and vendors  does not involve heavily automated computer dependent communications 
the company believes that with the conversions to new software and modifications to existing software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer system 
in the event the remaining conversions and modifications are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue is not expected to have a material impact on the operations of the company  as the products sold by the company and the processing and delivery equipment used are not date dependent  minimizing the impact of any year issues related to meeting customer requirements 
as the company has been incurring costs related to this project since and no significant additional costs have been identified  the company does not anticipate a material impact on the results of operations or cash flows related to the year issue
