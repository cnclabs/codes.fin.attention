fiscal year ended january  january  january  net sales cost of sales  including buying and occupancy costs gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses store closures and other charges operating income interest on debt and capital leases net income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and extraordinary loss provision benefit for income taxes income loss from continuing operations before extraordinary loss income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes income before extraordinary loss extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt  net of income taxes net income fiscal year ended january  compared to fiscal years ended january  and january  net sales fiscal consisted of weeks compared to weeks in each of fiscal and fiscal net sales for fiscal increased to  million from  million in fiscal  and increased from  million in fiscal the increase in net sales over these periods was primarily attributable to new store openings plus the additional week of sales in fiscal  partially offset by declines in comparable store sales and by store closures 
during fiscal  and  two  five and four stores were opened  respectively  and three  zero and two stores were closed  respectively 
comparable store sales declined and in fiscal and  respectively 
the declines were primarily attributable to increased competition in many of the markets in which the company operates 
the comparable store sales decline in fiscal was also attributable to extensive remodel construction  especially in the fourth quarter 
the comparable store sales decline in fiscal was also attributable to the relative weakness in the southern california housing market 
cost of sales cost of sales  which includes buying and occupancy costs  was of net sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the increase as a percent of net sales is primarily due to a combination of slightly lower average selling margins  which were impacted by competitive conditions  and somewhat higher buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales  due to comparable store sales declines 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a was of net sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the increase as a percent of net sales is primarily attributable to higher remodel related costs in fiscal  primarily incurred in the fourth quarter  partially offset by lower preopening costs due to fewer stores being opened in fiscal in october  the board of directors approved an accelerated growth strategy that included the remodeling of the remaining stores in the company s remodel program over the following six months and increasing the rate of new store openings 
the company expects that the remodeling of of the remaining stores will be completed in the first quarter of fiscal  with the remodeling of the final store being completed in the third quarter of fiscal as a result of the acceleration of remodels  the company incurred remodel related costs of approximately million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and expects to incur a similar amount in the first quarter of fiscal store closures and other charges in connection with the accelerated growth strategy  the board of directors also approved the closure of three under performing stores 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company recorded store closures and other charges of million  consisting of million for store closures and other related settlement costs  a million increase in the fiscal restructuring reserve and million in asset impairment charges 
costs included in the reserve for store closures primarily include lease obligations on closed facilities  write downs of fixed assets and other related settlement costs 
the company closed two stores in the fourth quarter of fiscal and expects to close a third store by the end of fiscal the company increased the fiscal restructuring reserve by million for additional lease obligations due to delays in obtaining subleases at terms acceptable to the company 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas  long lived assets held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
for purposes of evaluating the recoverability of long lived assets  the recoverability test is performed using undiscounted net cash flows of the individual stores 
the company s quarterly sfas analysis performed in the third quarter of fiscal indicated that the long lived assets at two stores were impaired 
accordingly  the company estimated the fair value of these assets based on their estimated salvage value and recorded an impairment charge of million  which is included in store closures and other charges 
interest on debt and capital leases  net interest on debt and capital leases  net  was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal interest on debt and capital leases is presented net of interest and investment income of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
net interest expense excludes capitalized interest of  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
interest expense was allocated to discontinued operations based on the ratio of bj s net assets to the sum of consolidated net assets plus consolidated debt 
the decline in net interest expense in fiscal from fiscal is primarily attributed to lower average outstanding debt balances in fiscal in july  million of the company s convertible subordinated debentures was converted into common stock and the remaining million was redeemed for cash 
also in july  the company repaid all of its senior notes due may   totaling million  and pursuant to a tender offer  repaid million of its senior subordinated notes due may   replacing this debt with short term bank borrowings 
bji assumed million of the bank borrowings at the time of the distribution 
the increase in net interest expense in fiscal from fiscal is primarily attributed to lower investment income due to decreased investments in marketable securities 
partially offsetting the increase in net interest expense was a lower amount of interest capitalized in fiscal compared to fiscal  and lower average outstanding debt balances in fiscal income tax provision benefit the income tax rate for income from continuing operations was in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the lower effective rate in fiscal is primarily attributed to a decrease in the effective tax rate in the state of california  where most of the company s stores are located 
the increase in the effective rate in fiscal from fiscal is primarily attributed to a lower level of tax exempt investments in fiscal than in fiscal income loss from continuing operations before extraordinary loss income loss from continuing operations before extraordinary loss for fiscal was million  or per share  diluted  compared to million  or per share  diluted  and million  or per share  diluted  in fiscal and  respectively 
excluding store closures and other charges  income from continuing operations for fiscal was million  or per share  diluted 
excluding store closures and other charges  income loss from continuing operations for fiscal as a percentage of net sales was  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the fiscal percentage  when compared to fiscal  reflects a slightly lower gross profit percentage  slightly higher sg a and lower interest expense  as described above 
the decline in fiscal from fiscal is primarily attributed to a lower gross profit percentage  slightly higher sg a and interest expense and a slightly higher tax provision rate 
income from continuing operations includes all of the corporate overhead expenses incurred by the company prior to the distribution and an allocation of the company s interest expense prior to the distribution 
as a result of the distribution  the conversion of the convertible subordinated debt into common stock and the refinancing of million of other indebtedness  income from continuing operations for periods preceding the distribution is not comparable to the company s income from continuing operations after the distribution 
net income net income in fiscal was million  or per share  diluted  compared to million  or per share  diluted  in fiscal and million  or per share  diluted  in fiscal these amounts include income from discontinued operations for periods prior to the distribution 
income from discontinued operations in fiscal  which includes the net income of bj s for the first six months  reduced by million of transaction costs  net of tax  incurred in connection with the distribution  was million  or per share  diluted  compared to million  or per share  diluted  in fiscal and million  or per share  diluted  in fiscal the results for fiscal include an extraordinary loss of million  net of tax  recorded in july  associated with the early extinguishment of the company s senior notes due may  and of million of its senior subordinated notes due may  restructuring reserves as of january   million of the company s fiscal restructuring charge remained accrued on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
during fiscal  the company incurred cash expenditures of million  primarily for lease obligations on closed facilities  and non cash charges of million for write downs of fixed assets 
as of january   million remained accrued on the company s consolidated balance sheet including million in fiscal additions to the reserve  consisting primarily of lease obligations on closed facilities  which extend through year compliance since many of the company s older computer software programs recognize only the last two digits of the year in any date eg for  some software programs may fail to operate properly in the year if they are not reprogrammed or replaced the year problem 
this could result in errors and miscalculations or even system failure causing disruptions in everyday business activities and transactions 
early in fiscal  the company commenced a program designed to timely mitigate and or prevent the adverse effects of the year problem and to pursue compliance with vendors 
the company believes that more than of its programs are now year compliant  and that it will be more than year compliant by the second quarter of fiscal  including all financial and accounting systems 
the company expects that all remaining systems will be year compliant by the end of fiscal this program is primarily being completed with internal resources 
as a result  the company does not believe that achieving year compliance will have a material impact on the company s financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
seasonality the company s business is subject to seasonal influences 
sales and profits have typically been lower in the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal year and higher in the second and third quarters  which include the most active seasons for home improvement sales 
recent accounting standards preopening costs consist of direct incremental costs of opening a facility and are charged to operations within the fiscal year that a new store opens 
the american institute of certified public accountants recently approved the statement of position sop entitled reporting on the cost of start up activities 
the sop  which will require entities to expense as incurred start up and preopening costs that are not otherwise capitalizable as long lived assets  is expected to be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company plans to adopt this sop in the first quarter of fiscal  which will not have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
no amounts were deferred at january  the company adopted sfas in fiscal all prior period net income per share figures have been restated to conform to the requirements of sfas in june  statement of financial accounting standards no

at april   the company had million available for borrowing under the revolving facility 
during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was million compared to net cash used of million in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily attributable to a higher accounts payable to inventory ratio and higher accrued expenses at the end of fiscal relative to fiscal net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations was million in fiscal compared to net cash used of million in fiscal investing activities primarily consist of capital expenditures and investments in marketable securities 
fiscal capital expenditures for continuing operations were million compared to million in fiscal during fiscal  the company opened two new stores and closed three stores

when used in this report  the words believe  estimate  expect  anticipate  plans  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
for this purpose  any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below  that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected 
although the company believes that comments reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  they are based on information existing at the time made 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations include  but are not limited to  the successful implementation of the company s accelerated growth strategy  general economic conditions prevailing in the company s markets  competition and other factors included below 
risk factors risks associated with accelerated growth strategy 
the company is implementing a strategy designed to strengthen its market position in the western united states and improve its profitability 
specifically  the company completed the remodeling of eight stores during fiscal  and expects to complete the remodeling of stores in the first quarter of fiscal and one store in the third quarter of fiscal the company may continue to experience a negative impact on sales and margins at stores being remodeled during the remodel period 
in addition  the company intends to increase the pace of new store openings 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete this remodeling program on schedule or within budget or that remodeled stores will realize an improvement in net sales 
the company opened two new stores in fiscal and intends to open two new stores during fiscal the company expects to open between eight and stores in each of fiscal and fiscal the company estimates that it will cost approximately million to open each of these new stores excluding land acquisition and building development costs 
the company s ability to open new stores on a timely and profitable basis is subject to various contingencies  some of which are beyond the company s control 
these contingencies include the company s ability to i find suitable new warehouse store locations of sufficient size and at acceptable prices  ii acquire the necessary governmental and regulatory permits and approvals  including zoning and development permits  iii construct the warehouse stores at budgeted cost and in a timely manner  iv hire and train sufficient numbers of qualified store managers and staff for new stores  and v integrate these new warehouse stores into the company s operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will achieve its planned expansion or that the company s new or remodeled stores will achieve sales  gross profit or operating income comparable to existing stores 
although the company s management carefully selects new store locations  there can be no assurance that the opening of additional homebase stores in existing markets will not negatively impact sales at existing homebase locations 
the accelerated growth strategy will require an increase in company personnel  particularly store managers and sales associates  who possess the training and experience necessary to meet the company s customer service standards 
the company may find it difficult to attract  develop and retain the personnel necessary to pursue its growth strategy successfully 
the company will also need to continually evaluate the adequacy of its management information systems  including its inventory control and distribution systems  and in the future may need to upgrade or reconfigure its management information systems to support its planned expansion 
moreover  as the company grows  it will need to continually analyze the sufficiency of its warehouse and distribution space and may require additional facilities to support such growth 
the inability of the company to attract and retain the necessary personnel  to expand and enhance its management information systems  or to increase its warehouse and distribution space could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company s operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if it encounters difficulties in implementing any part of its accelerated growth strategy 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully implement its accelerated growth strategy or that such strategy  if successfully implemented  will result in an improvement of the company s operating results 
competition 
the home improvement  hardware and garden businesses are highly competitive 
the company competes with a large number and variety of wholesalers and retailers  including several large national chains in the home improvement warehouse merchandising business  some of which have significantly greater financial and marketing resources than the company 
major competitors of the company that use the warehouse store format include the home depot  inc  eagle hardware garden  inc and builder s square a division of hechinger company 
competition exists primarily in the areas of price  product selection  location  service and name recognition 
competitive factors could require price reductions or cause an increase in operating costs  including increases in expenditures for marketing and customer service  that would adversely affect the company s operating results 
the company will also experience competition for qualified personnel and for suitable new store locations of sufficient size at acceptable prices 
some markets in which the company currently operates or might operate in the future may already be at or near the saturation point in terms of home improvement stores 
certain of the company s principal competitors appear to have a strategy of clustering stores within or saturating markets in which they operate  or of placing their warehouse stores so close to the company s stores as to directly challenge the company s competitive position in such markets 
such strategies could have a material adverse effect on the company s current operations and upon the profitability of the company s accelerated growth strategy 
approximately of the company s stores have at least one home improvement warehouse retailer within their trading area at an average distance of approximately three miles 
the company expects that its existing competitors  some of whom either have expansion plans in place or may seek to imitate the company s strategy  will open additional stores in the company s current market areas  which could adversely affect the company s competitive position 
absence of operating history as a separate company 
prior to the distribution  the business of the company was operated as a division of a much larger company  and therefore  the company does not have a significant operating history as a separate stand alone company 
prior to the distribution  bj s and the homebase division each had access to the cash flow generated by the other and to the company s combined credit  which was based on the combined assets and operating results of bj s and the homebase division 
the ability of the company to access credit facilities and capital markets in the future will depend on its financial performance as a separate stand alone company 
to the extent the company experiences reduced access to capital or higher capital costs  the company may have difficulty financing its growth strategy  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
reliance on certain markets 
the company s home improvement stores are located in the western united states  with more than half of them in california 
the company has been adversely affected from time to time by economic downturns experienced in its geographic markets  and future economic downturns in such regions could adversely affect the company 
in particular  the performance of the company s stores in recent years has been affected by the downturn in the southern california housing market 
although the company believes that the southern california housing market is experiencing a recovery  there is no assurance that such recovery will continue or that such recovery  if sustained  would improve the company s operating results 
in addition  the company is subject to other regional risks  including those related to or arising out of weather conditions  natural disasters  and state and local government regulation 
the occurrence of any of the events described above may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition  and on its store expansion program 
declines in comparable store sales 
a variety of factors affects the company s same store sales  including  among others  the timing and concentration of new store openings  actions of competitors including the opening of additional stores in the company s markets  the retail sales environment  general economic conditions  weather conditions and the company s ability to execute its business strategy effectively 
in recent years  the company s comparable stores sales have been negatively affected by increased competition and the depressed economic conditions in its major markets  particularly southern california 
there can be no assurance that these and other factors will not result in further declines or fluctuations in comparable store sales  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
environmental risks and regulations 
the company is subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental laws and regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge  emission and disposal of hazardous materials 
failure to comply with environmental laws could result in the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts of law  which could adversely affect operations 
the company does not have environmental liability insurance to cover such events 
the company has engaged and may continue to engage in real estate development projects and owns parcels of real estate on which its stores are located 
while the company is unaware of any significant environmental hazard on properties it owns or has owned  or operates or has operated 
in the event of any discovery of such hazard  severe penalties  including the costs of remediation  could be sought against the company  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
negative consequence of failure to qualify as tax free spin off 
prior to the distribution  the company received a letter ruling the letter ruling from the internal revenue service irs to the effect that  for federal income tax purposes  the distribution and certain related asset transfers would qualify as a spin off under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code that would be tax free to the company and to the holders of the company s common stock at the time of the distribution 
the letter ruling is based on and subject to certain assumptions  facts  representations and advice provided by the company  bji  holders of or more of the company s common stock and the company s financial advisor at the time of the distribution 
although the company is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such assumptions  facts  representations and advice unobtainable or untrue  certain future events not within the control of the company and bji  including  for example  an irs challenge to the distribution in the event that bji or the company is acquired before the end of fiscal  could cause the distribution not to qualify for tax free treatment  resulting in adverse consequences to the company and to its stockholders 
potential conflicts of interest  management overlap 
the interests of bji and the company may conflict due to the ongoing relationships between the companies 
such sources of conflict include the fact that the company remains liable for certain contractual obligations of bji  including bji leases  and the other arrangements between the parties regarding lease liabilities 
in addition  herbert j 
zarkin currently holds the executive offices of chairman of the company s board of directors and chairman of bji s board of directors  lorne r 
waxlax serves as a member of the board of directors of both the company and bji  and edward j 
weisberger serves as an officer and director of both the company and bji 
appropriate procedures are being followed by the company s board of directors to limit the involvement of messrs 
zarkin  weisberger and waxlax in conflict situations  including requiring them to abstain from voting as directors of the company on certain matters 
repurchase of notes at the option of holders upon a change of control  non availability of funds 
in the event of a change of control  as defined  each holder of the company s million senior subordinated notes the notes has the right to require the company to repurchase the notes in whole or in part at a redemption price of of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued interest to the repurchase date 
if a change of control were to occur  there can be no assurance that the company would have the financial resources or be able to arrange financing on acceptable terms to pay the repurchase price for all the notes as to which the purchase right is exercised 
further  any repurchase in connection with a change of control could  depending on the circumstances and absent a waiver from the holders of senior debt  be blocked due to the subordination provisions of the notes 
failure by the company to repurchase the notes when required may result in an event of default with respect to the notes and with respect to senior debt whether or not such repurchase is permitted by the subordination provisions 
continuing obligations of the company for certain lease liabilities after the distribution 
pursuant to the distribution  bji assumed all liabilities to third party lessors with respect to leases entered into by the company with respect to bj s 
while the company will continue to be liable  by law  with respect to such lease liabilities  bji has agreed to indemnify the company for such liabilities 
however  there is no assurance that bji will be able to make payments under the indemnity
