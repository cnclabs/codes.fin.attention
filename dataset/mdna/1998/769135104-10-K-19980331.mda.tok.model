income from operations 
wickes operations  as well as those of the building material industry generally  have reflected substantial fluctuations from period to period as a consequence of various factors  including levels of construction activity  general regional and local economic conditions  weather  prices of commodity wood products  interest rates and the availability of credit  all of which are cyclical in nature 
wickes anticipates that fluctuations from period to period will continue in the future 
because a substantial percentage of wickes sales are attributable to building professionals  certain of these factors may have a more significant impact on wickes than on companies more heavily focused on consumers 
wickes first quarter and  occasionally  its fourth quarter are adversely affected by weather patterns in the midwest and northeast  which result in seasonal decreases in levels of construction activity in these areas 
the extent of such decreases in activity is a function of the severity of winter conditions 
while wickes experienced relatively mild weather during the first quarter of  record setting snow falls throughout the midwest and northeast in january of  adversely affected construction activity in the first quarter of weather conditions in were relatively normal throughout the year

in addition  in wickes received insurance premium adjustments from a former insurance carrier in the amount of million and reversed an accrual of million for other disputed insurance premiums with this carrier 
accordingly selling  general and administrative expenses were reduced by million during the first three quarters of and by million in the fourth quarter of in the fourth quarter of  wickes recorded a gain of million on the sale of six pieces of real estate 
in the fourth quarter of  only three pieces of real estate were sold with a net gain of million 
gains or losses on the sale of real estate are recorded under other operating income 
wickes has historically generated approximately to of its annual revenues during the first quarter of each year  and wickes has historically recorded a significant net loss for this quarter 
as a result of these seasonal factors  wickes inventories and receivables reach peak levels during the second and third quarters and are generally lower during the first and fourth quarters  depending on sales volume and lumber prices

the increase in gross profit as a percent of sales is primarily attributable to reduced cost of sales as a result of a concerted effort to obtain the best pricing available 
wickes also expanded its sales of higher margin internally manufactured products by approximately from to  and experienced a reduction in costs associated with physical inventory count adjustments 
these increases were partially offset by increased percent of sales attributable to professional builders and an increase in the percent of sales attributable to lower margin commodity lumber products

as a result  it recorded a reduction in accrued costs and a benefit to restructuring and unusual charges of approximately million 
this benefit was partially offset by a million restructuring charge for severance and postemployment benefits and anticipated losses on the disposal of discontinued non core programs and related reductions in headquarters staffing which was announced by wickes in october of the non core programs affected by these reductions included the sale or closing of wickes mortgage lending  utilities marketing  and internet service programs not directly related to the building supply business

this increase was partially offset by a million gain recorded in as a result of the difference between insured replacement cost and book value as a result of a fire and storm damage at several of wickes building centers 
interest expense interest expense decreased to million in from million in  as a result of a decrease in company s overall effective borrowing rate of basis points  partially offset by an increase in average outstanding debt under wickes revolving line of credit of million

severe weather conditions in the first quarter of  together with mild weather in the first quarter of  and a decrease in same store sales staff as part of wickes efforts to better align its costs to its sales volume  were the major factors contributing to the same store sales decline

in addition  wickes significantly increased its efforts to collect previously reserved accounts receivable 
the provision attributable to the gerrity lumber acquisition centers improved significantly from to restructuring and unusual items after extensive review of the plan  and changes in business conditions in certain markets in which wickes operates  wickes made adjustments to the plan and incurred other one time costs resulting in a net million charge to results of operations in the fourth quarter of for restructuring and unusual items 
these adjustments included i the determination that three of the centers identified in the plan for closure will remain open  resulting in a million credit to restructuring expense  ii the extension of the plan to include the closing substantially completed by the end of of two building centers not previously included  resulting in a million charge for the write down of assets and liabilities to their net realizable value and a million charge for severance and post employment benefits  iii a million charge for impairment in the carrying value of real estate held for sale at closed centers  and iv a million credit with respect to the resolution of a claim at below the reserved amount
