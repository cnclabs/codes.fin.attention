item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by  the audited financial statements  including the notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this form k 
general paramount financial corporation and subsidiaries is a comprehensive asset management and business solution provider  offering customers a wide range of integrated services  including lease finance  it consulting  network design and implementation and staffing services 
the operating results of paramount are subject to quarterly fluctuations resulting from a variety of factors  including new product announcements by manufacturers  economic conditions  interest rate fluctuations and variations in the mix of leases written 
in addition  the company s sales volume fluctuates significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of the closing date and nature of each particular sales transaction 
the mix of leases written in a quarter is a result of a combination of factors  including changes in customer demands and or requirements  new product announcements  price changes  changes in delivery dates  changes in maintenance policies and pricing policies of equipment manufacturers  and price competition from other lessors 
leasing transactions other than sales type leases  in general  do not provide for significant earnings in the month of lease origination 
instead  revenue  expense and profit from lease transactions are recorded over the life of the asset and the lease 
lease revenue and lease expense recognition is dependent upon a number of factors  including the term of the lease  the accounting classification of the lease ie  operating  direct finance  or sales type and the commencement date of the lease and the lease financing within a particular period 
see lease accounting 
given the possibility of such fluctuations  the company believes that comparisons of the results of its operations for preceding quarters are not necessarily meaningful and that the results for one quarter should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
nineteen ninety seven was a year of expansion for paramount 
the company continued its evolution from a predominantly lease finance company into a total technology solution provider 
the key elements of this strategy have been the development and maturity of the company s systems integration and network design capabilities  and the continued expansion of the company s portfolio of essential it equipment on lease to relationship based end user customers 
the company believes that continuing to expand the portfolio of it equipment will create financial benefits over a continuum of time  since  unlike other equipment  it equipment is frequently upgraded and or enhanced during the term of its lease  resulting in opportunities to lease new equipment and re market displaced equipment 
further  as an integrated lessor and it solution provider  the company believes that it is well positioned to meet the ever changing needs of its customers 
the results of operations for the year ended december  are presented on a consolidated basis including the results of paratech  the company s system integration subsidiary  which commenced operations during the third quarter of the company believes that the addition of paratech has been a major step towards establishing paramount as a total high technology solution provider 
paratech generates revenue from sales of desktop computer and related systems and through sales of technical support services 
during  the company significantly added to paratech s sales and technical staff and broadened its product offerings 
as a result of this expansion  paratech s revenues increased by over the company invested heavily in paratech s personnel and infrastructure in this investment was a major contributor to paramount s loss from operations in the company views this loss as an investment in building a business that has the tools and organizational structure to sustain profitable growth 
paramount operates in a highly competitive and rapidly changing marketplace 
the company believes that its ability to adapt to changes and to evolve into a valued single source it solutions provider for its customers  offering a complete package of products and services in the high technology area  is a key component to the company s long term growth strategy 
lease accounting in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for leases  the company classifies its leases as either operating leases or direct finance leases 
the allocation of income among accounting periods within a lease term will vary depending upon the lease classification  as described below 
direct finance leases direct finance leases transfer substantially all benefits and risks of equipment ownership to the lessee 
a lease is a direct finance lease if it meets one of the following criteria the lease transfers ownership of the equipment to the lessee by the end of the lease term  the lease contains a bargain purchase option  the lease term at inception is at least of the estimated economic life of the leased equipment  or the present value of the minimum lease payments is at least of the fair value of the leased equipment at lease inception 
at lease inception  the cost of equipment under a direct finance lease is recorded as net investment in direct finance leases 
the difference between the gross lease payments receivable  plus the estimated residual value of the equipment  and the equipment cost is recognized as income over the life of the lease using the effective interest method 
a lease transaction which meets all of the above criteria  and in which the company has made a dealer s profit  is recorded as a sales type lease 
a sales type lease is a type of direct finance lease  in connection with which the company recognizes  at lease inception  revenue and profit which arises from the difference between the fair market value of the leased equipment and its acquisition cost 
operating leases all lease contracts which do not meet the criteria of direct finance leases are accounted for as operating leases 
monthly lease payments are recorded as operating lease revenue 
leased equipment is recorded at the company s cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over the lease term to the estimated residual value at the expiration of the lease term 
the company s portfolio of equipment on lease is further divided into equipment owned by paramount and equipment managed by paramount 
as of december   the portfolio of equipment on lease owned by paramount had a combined net book value on the balance sheet of million and had an original cost basis of million 
equipment managed by paramount is equipment on lease to customers of paramount which was subsequently sold to investors  but with respect to which paramount remains the lessor and remarketing agent

the results for the year ended december  include a one time  non cash adjustment of  to provision for income taxes 
this adjustment was necessitated by the change of the company s tax status from a sub chapter s corporation to a c corporation in connection with the company s january ipo  and was made in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no

in addition  the company s leasing business generates cash from fee related transactions 
the company finances substantially all of its leases by discounting the lease payment stream on a non recourse basis through various banks and financial institutions 
thus  the only cash required in these lease transactions is the residual value investment by the company 
the company believes that it currently has sufficient resources to make the residual value investments required to grow its lease portfolio 
in addition  the company has numerous options available to it for the financing of residual value investments  including sales of equipment on lease to equipment investors  residual value sharing arrangements  recourse loans and non recourse loans 
the company intends to use  on an opportunistic basis  all such available resources in order to maximize its portfolio of equipment on lease 
the company believes that it has completed its start up cash investment in paratech 
since deltaforce is an established operation  the company does not anticipate investing significant cash in this business 
however  in order to expand paratech s and deltaforce s operations  which the company is aggressively seeking to accomplish  the company will need to utilize its cash balances to fund follow on acquisitions 
the company is limited to its current cash balances for funding such acquisitions  unless the company is able in the future to raise significant additional financing 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise any such financing 
further  the company s cash funds for acquisitions might be limited to the extent that the company s current operations or the operations or any future acquisitions require the funding the of losses or the incurrence of capital outlay 
during the year ended december   the company entered into several residual value sharing and financing arrangements with an equipment investor totaling million 
this investor i purchased a portion of the company s residual value of equipment on lease in exchange for the right to share in remarketing proceeds generated from the equipment upon lease  and ii provided recourse financing for the remaining portion of the company s residual value investment 
the equipment on lease and the related leases serve as collateral for these financings 
during the year ended december   in connection with the early extension of leases  the company repaid million of such loans using the proceeds of these extensions 
the company expects to repay the balance of these loans through the proceeds generated from remarketing the subject equipment in the future 
these transactions allow the company to continue to grow and expand its lease portfolio without significantly affecting its current cash balances 
at december   the company had two types of credit lines available equipment bridge financing lines these lines allow the company to borrow up to million in the aggregate and are secured by equipment and contracts to sell or lease that equipment 
borrowings under these lines bear interest at above the prime rate 
in addition  one of these lines offers the company the ability to borrow up to  on an unsecured basis 
the purpose of these credit lines is to allow the company to pay its suppliers on a timely basis while waiting for the customer to pay or for the non recourse financing to occur 
during the year ended december   the company did not borrow any amounts from these lines  and accordingly had nothing outstanding as of december  as a result of its cash balances  the company has been able to internally finance its equipment purchases 
lease finance line this line allows the company to borrow up to million to permanently finance  on a recourse basis  the rental streams under certain lease transactions pledged as collateral 
the facility is secured by the individual leases pledged and the associated equipment 
the company is required to maintain certain financial ratios 
as of december   the company was not in compliance with the debt covenant requiring tangible net worth of at least million 
borrowings are financed at a fixed rate spread over the us treasury bill at the time of funding
