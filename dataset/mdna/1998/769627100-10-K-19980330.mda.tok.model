liquidity and capital resources the company had cash and cash equivalents of million at december   which increased million from december  significant debt service on the first mortgage notes is paid in february and august and should be considered in evaluating cash increases in the second and fourth quarters 
for the year ended december   the company s net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million for ebitda for and was million and million  respectively  which was adequate to cover the company s debt service and capital expenditures 
management believes that sufficient cash flow will be available to cover the company s debt service and enable investment in budgeted capital expenditures for the next months 
scheduled interest payments on the notes is provided by the contractual defeasance whereby a portion of the proceeds from the new notes was used to acquire us treasury securities sufficient to pay the interest on the notes in december and the interest  principal and premium due june  when the final release of obligation will be accomplished through redemption of the notes 
substantially all of the covenants on the notes were released as a result of the contractual defeasance 
cash flow from operations is not expected to be sufficient to pay of the principal of the notes at maturity on august  accordingly  the ability of the company to repay the notes at maturity will be dependent upon its ability to refinance those notes 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to refinance the principal amount of the notes at maturity 
the notes are not redeemable at the option of the company until august   and thereafter are redeemable at premiums beginning at and declining each subsequent year to par in the indenture pursuant to which the notes were issued the note indenture provides that  in certain circumstances  the company must offer to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of a change of control or certain other events 
in the event of such mandatory redemption or repurchase prior to maturity  the company would be unable to pay the principal amount of the notes without a refinancing 
the merger is specifically excluded from the defined transactions which would be considered a change in control 
the note indenture contains certain covenants which limit the ability of the company and its restricted subsidiaries  subject to certain exceptions  to i incur additional indebtedness  ii pay dividends or other distributions  repurchase capital stock or other equity interests or subordinated indebtedness  iii enter into certain transactions with affiliates  iv create certain liens  sell certain assets  and v enter into certain mergers and consolidations 
as a result of these restrictions  the ability of the company and roc to incur additional indebtedness to fund operations or to make capital expenditures is limited 
in the event that cash flow from operations is insufficient to cover cash requirements  the company and roc would be required to curtail or defer certain of their capital expenditure programs under these circumstances  which could have an adverse effect on the company s operations 
management believes the company is in compliance with the covenants of the note indenture 
in february  the company entered into a million  five year reducing revolving line of credit the credit facility 
the credit facility bears interest at prime plus or libor plus 
the company has not utilized this line of credit 
the credit facility was modified as a result of the notes and the proposed merger 
the modifications included an increase in the allowable funded debt to ebitda ratio to to one 
the company is not currently meeting this requirement and therefore  cannot draw down on the credit facility at this time 
the credit facility is callable upon a change in control other than the merger
