overview inbound was formed in and  together with its affiliates  is one of the largest independent teleservices companies in the united states 
during the first nine months of operations  the company focused its resources on designing and building an automated call processing platform to effectively manage large volumes of inbound calls 
in january  the company began offering automated voice response services utilizing its own proprietary technology platform 
in may  the company began offering outbound teleservices utilizing state of the art workstations staffed by highly trained teleservices representatives 
the company is a leading provider of each of these services to businesses on an outsourced basis 
the company also believes it has established a distinct competitive advantage in its ability to offer a range of services through its three operating divisions inbound  interactive and outbound on a fully integrated basis 
revenue revenue increased million or to million in from million in the increase in revenue included million derived from new clients and million derived from existing clients 
the overall revenue increase is attributable to higher call volumes

during  at t remained the company s largest client and accounted for of total revenue 
during the year ended december   interactive transferred calls to a live agent at inbound to complete a service that began on interactive voice response units 
inbound billed interactive for the live operator portion of the call and interactive billed the entire service provided by both divisions 
consequently  a portion of interactive revenue reported on the company s reports on form q in represents services delivered by inbound 
management feels that it would be more appropriate to include the revenue in the division that provided the services rather than where the revenue is invoiced to the client

expenses costs of telecommunications services incurred by the company are primarily comprised of long distance transmission charges 
the company effectively manages its telecommunications costs through a long term services contract with at t which includes an established rate schedule subject to certain call volume commitments 
as one of the largest clients of at t  the company believes it has negotiated a favorable contract at an attractive service rate 
the company has also entered into a number of equipment maintenance and network management contracts with at t in order to facilitate reliable and efficient network operations 
rates for telecommunications services are primarily determined by total call volume and level of network management and technical support under contract 
the company manages its direct labor costs through its flexible staffing and scheduling initiatives 
in particular  the company has developed its own proprietary scheduling systems which are designed to optimize staffing and pay levels in anticipation of fluctuating call volumes as clients campaigns are scheduled 
the company seeks to control its direct labor costs by decentralizing its operations and by seeking new geographic markets which offer attractive labor market characteristics for its inbound and outbound services 
direct labor rates fluctuate based upon local market factors such as the size and availability of a part time workforce in addition to local economic growth 
labor rates are adjusted  as necessary  to attract the required number of service representatives during seasonal fluctuations 
during the year ended december   the company experienced improvement in direct cost as a percentage of revenue due in part to more favorable labor rates realized by entering new local markets 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of all expenses that support the ongoing operation of the company 
these expenses include costs related to division management  facilities costs  equipment depreciation and maintenance  amortization of goodwill  allowance for doubtful accounts  sales and marketing activities  client support services  and corporate management costs 
changes in selling  general and administrative expenses primarily reflect the addition of new facilities over certain periods or expanded marketing activities 
prior to the reorganization of the company on november  each of the west affiliates were treated for federal income tax purposes as an s corporation under the internal revenue code 
as a result  the stockholders of each of the west affiliates  rather than the west affiliates  have paid all federal income tax on the west affiliates income through november  each of the west affiliates has made periodic distributions to its stockholders in amounts approximately equal to its stockholders corresponding tax liabilities associated with such companies earnings plus amounts representing a portion of retained earnings 
additionally  the company has earned state income tax credits in nebraska under a job creation and investment incentive program 
as a result  the west affiliates stockholders have paid little  if any  state income tax in nebraska 
on november   the company became a c corporation for federal and state income tax purposes 
the company still is eligible for similar tax credits in nebraska  at least through  so long as the company continues to create additional employment positions within that state 
as the company opens new facilities in states without job or investment tax credits  or in states with corporate income taxes  its effective tax rate may increase

impact of the year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year

the company is in the process of initiating formal communications with all of its significant suppliers and large customers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issue  and the company s current assessments are based on presently available information 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have material adverse effect on the company 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  and test the software for year modifications 
the company plans to complete the year project by december  the total remaining cost of the year project is estimated at million and is being funded through operating cash flows 
of the total projected cost  approximately million is attributable to the purchase of new software and hardware which will be capitalized 
the remaining million  which will be expensed as incurred over the next two years  is not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company plans to complete the year modifications and conversions are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  failure of third parties on which the company relies and similar uncertainties 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future
