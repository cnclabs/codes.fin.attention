of the  shares   shares were issued and sold by the company and  shares were sold by a shareholder of the company 
shortly thereafter  the representatives of the several underwriters exercised their over allotment option resulting in the sale of  shares by other shareholders of the company 
the net proceeds to the company were approximately  the company did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling shareholders 
during the third quarter of  the company used  of the proceeds from the initial public offering for the acquisitions of data systems technology  inc and dp career associates described in note of notes to financial statements 
on september   the company made its first quarterly sale of stock under the metro information services  inc employee stock purchase plan the espp and sold  shares of common stock for  on december   the company sold  shares of common stock to the espp for  the espp is described in note of notes to financial statements 
during  the company funded its operations from cash generated by operations and  to a lesser extent  from borrowings under the company s revolving credit facilities 
these borrowings were repaid with proceeds from the initial public offering 
net cash provided by operations was  for and consisted primarily of net income of  and  excluding the effects of acquisitions  increases in accounts receivable of  accounts payable of  and accrued compensation and benefits of  the increases in accounts receivable  accounts payable  and accrued compensation and benefits are primarily due to the revenue growth experienced during the company s working capital was  at december  compared to  at december  the company has  of credit facilities provided in equal amounts by three banks  all of which is available 
the facilities have a five year maturity  which may be extended each year for an additional year 
if the facilities are not extended  principal on one of the facilities must be repaid in four equal annual installments while the other two facilities require principal repayment at the end of four years 
until that time interest only is payable monthly 
two of the facilities allow the company to select among prime rate and london interbank offered rate page libor based interest rates while the third has only libor based interest rates 
all of the facilities have interest rates  which increase as the balance outstanding under the facilities increases 
at december   no amounts were outstanding under the facilities 
the company has selected a day libor based rate and  if any borrowings were outstanding under the facilities at december   the rate on such borrowings would have borne interest rates ranging from to 
the facilities also contain fees  ranging from to annually  which are charged on the unused portion of the facilities 
the facilities are collateralized by accounts receivable of the company 
the credit facilities contain several covenants  including one requiring the maintenance of a certain tangible net worth ratio  which limit the amount of dividends that can be paid 
the covenants also impose limits on incurring additional debt and require a certain debt service coverage ratio to be maintained 
amounts advanced under the facilities can be used for acquisitions and general working capital purposes 
the company believes that the net proceeds from its initial public offering  combined with available funds under its credit facilities and cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet its needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next two years 
any significant acquisitions  however  may require additional debt and equity financing 
seasonality metro s operating results are adversely affected when client facilities close due to holidays or inclement weather 
the company generally experiences a certain amount of seasonality in the fourth quarter due to the number of holidays and closings of client facilities during that quarter 
further  the company generally experiences lower operating results in the first quarter due in part to the timing of unemployment and fica tax accruals and delays in clients contract renewals related to clients budget approval processes 
inflation due to the high demand for it services and a shortage of qualified it consultants  wage inflation in the it services industry surpassed normal wage inflation during if this trend continues  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition if the company is unable to pass increased payroll costs on to its clients 
the company attempts to obtain bill rate increases from clients to offset these increases whenever possible 
the company expects to obtain bill rate increases in to offset pay rate increases in  although there can be no assurance that this will occur 
average pay rates for increased over average pay rates for average pay rates for increased over average pay rates for the company expects average pay rate increases in will equal or exceed these percentages 
year issues the company relies heavily on computer systems to run its business  including  without limitation  recruiting  candidate tracking  payroll  human resources  benefits and financial accounting systems 
many of these systems use dates to make computations necessary to process information accurately 
until recently computer programs used a two digit date to indicate a year 
for example  the year is indicated in these programs by the digits as the year approaches  these programs will need to make computations involving and later years 
programs that use only a two digit year may misinterpret the year for the year  resulting in an incorrect calculation 
almost all companies using computerized systems face year yk issues 
the company believes that yk issues involve the risk that the company s computerized systems and those of its clients  suppliers  vendors  financial institutions and others will be disrupted or fail 
the company has also identified as a risk the possible loss of revenue when consultants on yk assignments complete their assignments 
these risks are discussed below 
internal risks 
fixing the yk problem in the company s systems involves ongoing evaluations of the company s computerized systems  identifying the affected systems and fixing or replacing them 
the company completed an initial evaluation of its systems in the company s initial evaluation indicated that its proprietary page systems are yk compliant 
the company is implementing other systems which it believes are yk compliant 
see new systems implementation 
external risks 
the company does not regularly transmit or receive financial information from clients  suppliers  vendors or financial institutions 
in those circumstances where information is being exchanged electronically  the company believes that these clients  suppliers  vendors and financial institutions are taking steps to address their yk issues in a timely fashion 
as a result  the company does not expect yk issues to cause a material adverse effect in this area 
a greater risk is posed if the company s clients  suppliers  vendors and financial institutions are not yk compliant and their noncompliance causes a material disruption to their businesses 
these disruptions could include  among other things a client s inability to process payments to the company  a financial institution s inability to process checks drawn on the company s bank accounts  accept deposits or process wire transfers  a client s  supplier s  vendor s or financial institution s business failure  an interruption in deliveries of computer equipment and other supplies from vendors  a loss of voice and data connections the company uses to share information  and other interruptions to the normal conduct of business by the company  the nature and extent of which the company cannot foresee 
the company is unable to determine the nature  length or effect such interruptions  if any  may have on the company 
business risks 
as an it services company  the company has benefited from yk issues by providing consultants with the skills necessary to help address these issues for its clients 
the company faces the risk of reduced business opportunities and revenue as clients resolve their yk issues if yk assignments are not replaced with other assignments 
the company believes that when consultants complete yk assignments  many of these consultants will be re assigned to perform activities delayed by clients while addressing yk issues 
in other cases  the company will need to find other assignments for these consultants 
the company estimates that  at december   approximately of the company s consultants were involved in yk assignments 
new systems implementation the company has licensed new human resources  payroll and financial accounting software 
these systems provide enhanced capabilities and integration of information and are believed to be yk compliant 
a combination of metro employees and outside consultants will be used to implement these systems 
the company s current estimate of the cost to replace these systems is million 
the company expects to capitalize and amortize these costs over these systems useful lives 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  which establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in financial statements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  in the opinion of management  sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
risk associated with future operations dependence on qualified personnel 
the company s success depends on its ability to attract and retain consultants with the technical skills and experience required to meet its clients specific needs 
the company must continually identify and recruit technical personnel in each of its markets to fill new positions and to replace consultants who have left the company 
the it industry has high consultant turnover rates and the demand for consultants has  to date  substantially exceeded supply 
this has resulted in intense competition for consultants and the company expects such competition for consultants to increase in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company will attract and retain the personnel it requires to conduct its operations successfully or attract additional personnel for expanded operations 
failure to attract and retain such personnel or an increase in the company s page consultant turnover rate could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
risk associated with opening new offices 
the company recently accelerated its office expansion program by opening four new offices in  three new offices in and four new offices in in geographic markets where the company had no previous presence 
in addition  the company expects to open three to five offices annually for the next several years 
historically  for approximately six to months after opening  new offices have generally produced monthly operating losses or marginal operating income and have placed significant demands on the company s operational  administrative and financial resources 
in addition  the company s future performance and profitability will depend  in part  on its ability to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel to manage the growth and operations of the new offices 
the opening of additional offices  individually or in the aggregate  may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
risk associated with growth through acquisitions 
the company intends to grow  in part  through the acquisition of other it businesses 
the company s acquisition strategy depends on its ability to identify  finance and complete acquisitions 
there is significant competition for acquisition opportunities which may increase the cost of acquisition candidates 
some competitors for these candidates have greater resources than the company 
the company will face a variety of additional risks if it completes acquisitions  including the inability to integrate the acquired businesses into the company s operations  the inability to achieve expected financial results from the acquired businesses  the diversion of management s attention  the inability to retain key personnel of the acquired businesses  losses due to liabilities and contingencies of the acquired businesses and the adverse impact on net income caused by amortization of acquired intangible assets 
the company s failure or inability to successfully implement and manage its acquisition strategy may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the value of company stock held by shareholders at the time of any acquisition may be diluted if the company issues stock to complete any acquisition 
risk associated with new services 
the company intends to grow  in part  through the development or acquisition of it services beyond the scope of services presently provided by the company 
the company s ability to successfully develop new services depends on a number of factors  including its ability to identify and effectively integrate new services into the company s existing operating structure 
the identification and offering of new services in which the company has no or little experience or expertise could result in diversion of management s attention and place disproportionate demands on the company s operational  administrative and financial resources 
there can be no assurance that the performance of any new service offerings  whether acquired or developed by the company  will meet management s expectations or provide the same profit margins as the company s existing operations 
competition 
the it services industry is extremely competitive and highly fragmented 
although the market is consolidating  management believes no one company is dominant 
the company s competitors include general it services firms  temporary staffing and personnel placement companies  general management consulting firms  major accounting firms  divisions of large hardware and software companies and niche providers of it services 
some of the company s competitors possess substantially greater resources  greater name recognition and a more established client base than the company 
in addition  the services offered by the company have been and continue to be provided by clients in house personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competitors as the industry continues to evolve 
trend toward prime vendors 
to reduce the number of their it service providers  certain businesses are beginning to use a limited number of vendors and  in some cases  a single vendor collectively  prime vendors 
these prime vendors fill client needs directly or through subcontractors 
metro anticipates that this trend toward prime vendors may become increasingly common in the marketplace and may result in pricing pressure and the loss of business opportunities 
there can be no assurance that this trend will not lead to reduced gross profit margins and fewer opportunities to place consultants and will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
page the company has taken steps  when practical  to become a prime vendor of it services 
in certain cases  the company experiences pricing pressure from clients as a condition to becoming or remaining a prime vendor 
in other cases  the company experiences demands to provide consultants in multiple locations to become or remain a prime vendor 
although the company believes it can effectively meet its clients requirements  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete effectively with other prime vendors or remain a prime vendor 
absence of long term contracts  dependence on key clients 
substantially all of the company s contracts to perform services may be canceled or modified by the company s clients at will without penalty 
approximately of the company s consultants are salaried employees and unless terminated  receive full compensation and benefits even if not engaged in billable work 
as a result  cancellation or reduction of a contract may result in a loss of revenue without a corresponding reduction in cost of revenue 
although the company has a broad client base  the loss of one or more large clients could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in  and  the company s largest clients accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the company s revenue and its largest client accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of revenue 
contract performance and project outsourcing risks 
project outsourcing is distinguishable from the company s core business in that project outsourcing requires the company to assume a greater level of responsibility for developing or maintaining systems on behalf of its clients 
many of the company s project outsourcing engagements are critical to the operations of its clients businesses 
the company s failure or inability to complete such engagements to its clients satisfaction could have a material adverse effect on its clients operations and  consequently  may give rise to claims against the company for actual or consequential damages or otherwise damage its reputation  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
rapid technological change 
rapid technological advances  frequent product introductions and enhancements  and changes in client requirements characterize the market for it services 
the company s future success depends  in part  on its ability to provide consultants possessing the skills to service past  current and next generation products and technologies 
these factors will require the company to provide adequately trained personnel to address the increasing and evolving needs of its clients 
any failure by the company to anticipate or respond rapidly to technological advances  new products and enhancements or changes in client requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
employment liability risks 
metro employs and places its consultants and other employees at its clients businesses 
risks associated with this activity include possible claims of discrimination and harassment  liabilities for errors and omissions by the company s employees  misuse of client proprietary information or intellectual property  injury to company and client employees  misappropriation of client funds  theft of client property  other criminal activity  torts and other similar claims 
in certain circumstances  the company may be held responsible for the actions of persons not under the company s direct control 
although the company has not had significant problems with respect to such employment liability  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience such problems in the future 
reliance on technology and computer systems 
the company relies on its computer and communications systems  the hub of which is located at its corporate headquarters in virginia beach  virginia 
although the company has a disaster recovery plan  temporary or permanent loss of these systems from fire  power loss  natural disaster  operating malfunction or any other cause could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate the company for all losses that may occur 
in addition  the company is in the process of implementing new human resources  payroll and financial accounting software systems 
an unsuccessful implementation of these new systems or significant delays in their implementation could have a material adverse effect on the company s business operations 
dependence on senior management 
the continued growth and success of the company is largely dependent on the efforts  direction and guidance of its existing senior management and on its ability to attract and retain qualified page managers 
the company has entered into employment agreements with its executive officers  each of which contains provisions limiting these employees rights to compete with the company and hire its employees 
the loss of any of the company s senior management or key personnel and  in particular  john h 
fain  president and chief executive officer  or andrew j 
downing  executive vice president and chief operating officer  or the inability to attract and retain key management personnel in the future  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company carries no key man life insurance on mr 
fain or mr 
downing 
health plan self insurance risks 
the company self insures a portion of its group health and dental plan 
on december    of the company s  employees were covered by the group health plan 
the company self insures up to  of claims per covered employee per year with a company maximum annual aggregate liability of of expected claims as computed at the end of each year based on the number of covered persons during the year 
self insurance charges may fluctuate materially from quarter to quarter and may cause a material adverse effect on the company s quarterly and annual business  operating results and financial condition
