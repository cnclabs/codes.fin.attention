currently  the funds have two operating master funds  the merrimac cash portfolio and the merrimac treasury portfolio  and three operating feeder funds  the merrimac cash fund  the merrimac global cash fund  and the merrimac treasury fund  with assets totaling over billion at december  the company has engaged the bank of new york to act as sub advisor to manage the investments of the merrimac cash portfolio and has engaged aeltus investment management  inc to act as sub advisor to manage the investments of the merrimac treasury portfolio 
in addition to acting as advisor to the funds  the bank has entered into agreements to provide custody  fund accounting  administration  transfer agency and certain other related services to the funds 
the merrimac feeder funds offer shares only to institutions and other accredited investors as that term is defined in rule a under the securities act of and invest all of their assets in the merrimac master funds 
the funds may add additional feeder funds and or master funds in the future 
on january   the company completed the issuance and sale of  in capital securities 
the capital securities were issued by investors capital trust l  a delaware statutory business trust sponsored by the company 
the capital raised in the offering  along with existing capital and earnings generated in the future  will be used to support the company s balance sheet growth 
the capital securities qualify as tier i capital under the capital guidelines of the federal reserve 
under current federal reserve guidelines  no more than of the company s tier capital may comprise capital securities and other capital securities and cumulative preferred stock of the company 
in september the company completed an exchange offer pursuant to which all outstanding capital securities were exchanged for substantially identical capital securities registered under the securities act of the company s current largest client  eaton vance  accounted for    and of the company s net operating revenues for the year ended october   for the transition period  and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company believes its relationship with eaton vance is good and expects it to continue 
the company s agreements with mutual funds managed by eaton vance  pursuant to which the company provides custody and fund accounting services  extend through august and continue thereafter until terminated by either party upon sixty days prior notice 
if a majority of noninterested trustees of a fund determines that the performance of the company under any such agreement has been unsatisfactory or adverse to the interests of the fund s shareholders  or that the terms of the agreement are no longer consistent with publicly available industry standards  the company shall have days after receipt of written notice to such effect to i correct its performance or ii renegotiate such terms 
if such corrective action or renegotiation is not satisfactory to such trustees  such agreement may be terminated on sixty days prior notice 
there have been no requests for corrective action or renegotiation to date pursuant to these contract clauses 
the company derives its revenues from financial asset administration services and private banking transactions 
although interest income and noninterest income are reported separately for financial statement presentation purposes  the company s clients view the pricing of the company s asset administration and banking service offerings on a bundled basis 
in establishing a fee structure for a specific client  management analyzes the expected revenue and related expenses  as opposed to separately analyzing fee income and interest income and related expenses for each from such relationship 
accordingly  management believes net operating revenue net interest income plus noninterest income and net income are the most meaningful measures of financial results 
revenue generated from asset administration and other fees and interest income increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  noninterest income consists primarily of fees for financial asset administration and is principally derived from custody  multicurrency accounting  transfer agency and administration services for financial asset managers and the assets they control 
the company s clients pay fees based on the volume of assets under custody  the number of securities held and portfolio transactions  income collected and whether other value added services such as foreign exchange  securities lending and performance measurement are needed 
asset based fees are usually charged on a sliding scale 
as such  when the assets in a portfolio under custody grow as a result of changes in market values or cash inflows  the company s fees may be a smaller percentage of those assets 
fees for individually managed accounts  such as custodial  trust and portfolio accounting services for individuals  investment advisors  private trustees  financial planners  other banks and fiduciaries  and other institutions are also included in noninterest income 
net interest income represents the difference between income generated from interest earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
interest bearing liabilities are generated by the company s clients who  in the course of their financial asset management  generate cash balances which they deposit on a short term basis with the company 
the company invests these cash balances and remits a portion of the earnings on these investments to its clients 
the company s share of earnings from these investments is viewed as part of the total package of compensation paid to the company from its clients for performing asset administration services 
certain factors that may affect future results from time to time  information provided by the company  statements made by its employees or information included in its filings with the securities and exchange commission including this form k may contain statements which are not historical facts  so called forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
forward looking statements in this k include certain statements regarding capital ratios and liquidity 
the company s actual future results may differ significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below 
each of these factors  and others  are discussed from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the company s future results may be subject to substantial risks and uncertainties 
because certain fees charged by the company for its services are based on the market values of assets processed  such fees and the company s quarterly and annual operating results are sensitive to changes in interest rates  declines in stock market values  and investors seeking alternatives to the investment offerings of the company s clients 
also  the company s interest related services  along with the market value of the company s investments  may be adversely affected by rapid changes in interest rates 
in addition  many of the company s client engagements are  and in the future are likely to continue to be  terminable upon days notice 
the company relies on certain intellectual property protections to preserve its intellectual property rights 
any invalidation of the company s intellectual property rights or lengthy and expensive defense of those rights could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition the year issue discussed below may affect the company s operations 
the segment of the financial services industry in which the company is engaged is extremely competitive 
certain current and potential competitors of the company are more established and benefit from greater market recognition and have substantially greater financial  development and marketing resources than the company 
the company s quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues and profitability  including the timing of the commencement or termination of client engagements  the rate of net inflows and outflows of investor funds in the debt and equity based investment vehicles offered by the company s clients  the introduction and market acceptance of new services by the company and changes or anticipated changes in economic conditions 
because the company s operating expenses are relatively fixed  any unanticipated shortfall in revenues in a specified period may have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations for that period 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  the company may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect its business  financial condition  operating results and stock price 
impact of the year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
in late the company  with the assistance of an outside consultant  completed a detailed assessment of the company s year compliance status 
as part of the assessment process  the company also developed project plans for application renovation and testing 
based on this assessment  the company determined that it will be required to modify or upgrade portions of its software so that its computer systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  the company presently believes that with modifications to  or upgrades of  existing software  the year issue can be mitigated 
however  if such modifications and upgrades are not made  or are not completed in a timely manner  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company has initiated formal communications with all of its significant suppliers and large customers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issue 
the company s total year project cost and estimates to complete include the estimated costs and time associated with the impact of a third party s year issue  and are based on presently available information 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to modify or upgrade existing software and to test such software for year compliance 
the company plans to complete the year project  including all testing  by december  the total remaining cost of the year project is estimated at  which will be expensed as incurred over the next twelve months  and is being funded through operating cash flows 
these amounts are not expected to have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
to date  the company has incurred and expensed approximately  related to the assessment of  and preliminary remediation efforts in connection with  its year project and the development of a remediation plan 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company plans to complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer code  the compatibility of third party interfaces and similar uncertainties

the remainder of the increase relates to growth in assets processed

this net increase resulted from an increase in interest income of  offset by an increase in interest expense of  the net impact of the above changes was an basis point decrease in net interest margin 
the increase in interest income resulted primarily from a higher level of interest earning assets 
the company s average assets for the year ended december  increased  or compared to the year ended december  this growth primarily resulted from an increase in average interest earning assets of  interest expense increased  due primarily to the higher level of deposits and borrowings and to a lesser extent to an increase in the interest rate paid by the company

total assets processed increased to billion at december  from billion at december  of the billion net increase in assets processed from december  to december   approximately of the increase reflects assets processed for new clients  and the remainder of the increase reflects growth of assets processed for existing clients and improved methods for tracking the amount of assets processed  offset in part by the assets of clients no longer serviced by the company 
the remainder of the growth in asset administration fees was due to the net expansion of relationships with existing clients and increased use of the company s cash management and foreign exchange services 
in addition  because the company is now able to accept deposits that had been historically directed to other financial institutions due to ceba asset growth restrictions  the company has experienced a shift in the mix of compensation received from its clients 
see overview in this item a larger portion of the company s compensation from clients is now in the form of interest income generated from client deposits  resulting in a decrease to asset administration fees and a related increase in net interest income 
the growth in asset administration fees was also offset by the transfer of unit investment trust assets discussed below 
the administration of these assets accounted for approximately  in asset administration fees in the year ended december  unit investment trust uit assets processed by the company have decreased over the last five years  a reflection of declining investor demand for this type of unmanaged investment product 
declining asset levels led one client  merrill lynch  to consolidate its asset administration service providers  and it agreed  effective march   to pay the company to assign the company s servicing rights to the bank of new york company 
the company recognized proceeds of  net of expenses  resulting from the assignment of the rights to service approximately billion of the client s unit investment trust assets

the growth in assets processed between periods contributed to  increase between periods 
also contributing to the increase was the company s continued use of contract programmers which accounted for  of the increase between periods 
the increase in transaction processing expense relates primarily to an increase in subcustodian fees and pricing services  driven by the growth in assets processed 
this expense increased  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase resulted from the increase in foreign assets processed  which are subject to higher subcustodian fees  from billion at december  to billion at december   and from the movement by clients into emerging markets which have higher costs due to structural inefficiencies

financial condition investment portfolio the following table summarizes the company s investment portfolio for the dates indicated october  december  dollars in thousands securities held to maturity us treasury us  state and political subdivisions  mortgage backed securities     federal agency securities    foreign government securities   total securities held to maturity     securities available for sale us treasury us    municipal bonds  mortgage backed securities    total securities available for sale    the investment portfolio is used to invest depositors funds and provide a secondary source of earnings for the company 
in addition  the company uses the investment portfolio to secure open positions at securities clearing institutions in connection with its custody services 
the portfolio is comprised of us treasury securities  securities of state and political subdivisions  mortgage backed securities issued by the federal national mortgage association fnma or fannie mae and the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc or freddie mac  and federal agency callable bonds issued by fhlmc and the federal home loan bank of boston fhlbb  municipal securities  and foreign government bonds issued by the canadian provinces of ontario and manitoba 
the company invests in mortgage backed securities and federal agency callable bonds to supplement its portfolio of us treasury securities and increase the total return of the investment portfolio 
mortgage backed securities generally have a higher yield than us treasury securities due to credit and prepayment risk 
credit risk results from the possibility that a loss may occur if a counterparty is unable to meet the terms of the contract 
prepayment risk results from the possibility that changes in interest rates may cause mortgage securities to be paid off prior to their maturity dates 
federal agency callable bonds generally have a higher yield than us treasury securities due to credit and call risk 
credit risk results from the possibility that the federal agency issuing the bonds may be unable to meet the terms of the bond 
call risk results from the possibility that fluctuating interest rates and other factors may result in the exercise of the call option by the federal agency 
credit risk related to mortgage backed securities and federal agency callable bonds is substantially reduced by payment guarantees and credit enhancements 
the company invests in municipal securities to generate stable  tax advantaged income 
municipal securities generally have lower stated yields than federal agency and us treasury securities  but the after tax yields are comparable 
municipal securities are subject to credit risk 
the company invests in foreign government bonds in order to generate foreign source income to maximize the use of the foreign tax credit 
the foreign government bonds are denominated in us dollars to avoid foreign currency risk 
these bonds are subject to credit risk 
the book value and weighted average yield of the company s securities held to maturity at december   by effective maturity  are reflected in the following table 
weighted average book value yield due from one to five years  due after five years up to ten years  due after ten years  total securities held to maturity  the book value and weighted average yield of the company s securities available for sale at december   by effective maturity  are reflected in the following table 
weighted average book value yield due within one year  due from one to five years  due after five years up to ten years  due after ten years total securities available for sale  loan portfolio the following table summarizes the company s loan portfolio for the dates indicated october  december  loans to individuals     loans to not for profit organizations loans to mutual funds    less allowance for loan losses net loans     floating rate     fixed rate virtually all loans to individually managed account customers are written on a demand basis  bear variable interest rates tied to the prime rate and are fully secured by liquid collateral  primarily freely tradable securities held in custody by the company for the borrower 
since december  the company has entered into agreements to provide up to an aggregate of million under lines of credit to mutual fund clients 
the unsecured lines of credit may  in the event of a default  be collateralized at the company s option by securities held in custody by the company for those mutual funds 
loans to mutual funds also include advances by the company to certain mutual fund clients pursuant to the terms of the custody agreements between the company and those clients 
at december   the company s only lending concentrations which exceeded of total loans were the revolving lines of credit to mutual fund clients discussed above 
these loans were made in the ordinary course of business on the same terms and conditions prevailing at the time for comparable transactions 
the company s credit loss experience has been excellent 
there have been no loan chargeoffs or adverse credit actions in the history of the company 
it is the company s policy to place a loan on non accrual status when either principal or interest becomes days past due and the loan s collateral is not sufficient to cover both principal and accrued interest 
as of december   there were no past due loans  troubled debt restructurings  or any loans on non accrual status 
although virtually all of the company s loans are fully collateralized with freely tradable securities  management recognizes some credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio  and has recorded an allowance for loan losses of  at december  this amount is not allocated to any particular loan  but is intended to absorb any risk of loss inherent in the loan portfolio 
management actively monitors the loan portfolio and the underlying collateral and regularly assesses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
interest rate sensitivity the company  like all financial intermediaries  is subject to interest rate risk 
rapid changes in interest rates could adversely affect the profitability of the company by causing changes in the market value of the company s assets and its net interest income 
interest rate risk arises when an earning asset matures or when its rate of interest changes in a time frame different from that of the supporting interest bearing liability 
by seeking to minimize the difference between the amount of earning assets and the amount of interest bearing liabilities that could change interest rates in the same time frame  the company attempts to reduce the risk of significant adverse effects on net interest income caused by interest rate changes 
the company does not attempt to match each earning asset with a specific interest bearing liability 
instead  as shown in the table below  it aggregates all of its earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to determine the difference between these in specific time frames 
this difference is known as the rate sensitivity gap 
a positive gap indicates that more earning assets than interest bearing liabilities mature in a time frame  and a negative gap indicates the opposite 
maintaining a balanced position will reduce risk associated with interest rate changes  but it will not guarantee a stable interest rate spread because the various rates within a time frame may change by differing amounts and change in different directions 
the company seeks to manage interest rate risk by investment portfolio actions designed to address the interest rate sensitivity of asset cash flows in relation to liability cash flows 
portfolio actions used to manage interest rate risk include managing the effective duration of the portfolio securities and utilizing interest rate floors and interest rate swaps 
interest rate contracts are used to hedge against large rate swings and changes in the shape of the yield curve 
interest rate contracts involve elements of credit and market risk which are not reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
such instruments are entered into for hedging as opposed to investment or speculative purposes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company periodically monitors the financial stability of its counterparties according to prudent investment guidelines and established procedures 
there can be no assurance that such portfolio actions will adequately limit interest rate risk 
the following table presents the repricing schedule for the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  within over three over six over one three to six to twelve year to over five months months months five years years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets federal funds sold   investment securities       loans fixed rate loans variable rate   total interest earning assets       interest bearing liabilities demand deposit accounts   savings accounts   interest rate contracts      short term borrowings   total interest bearing liabilities       net interest sensitivity gap during the period       cumulative gap     interest sensitive assets as a percent of interest sensitive liabilities cumulative interest sensitive assets as a percent of total assets cumulative net interest sensitivity gap as a percent of total asets cumulative gap as a percent of total asets adjustable rate assets are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period in which they are due 
fixed rate loans are included in the period in which they are scheduled to be repaid 
mortgage backed securities are included in the pricing category that corresponds with their contractual maturity 
liquidity liquidity represents the ability of an institution to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management 
for a financial institution such as the company  these obligations arise from the withdrawals of deposits and the payment of operating expenses 
the company s primary sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents  federal funds sold  new deposits  short term borrowings  interest payments on securities held to maturity and available for sale  fees collected from asset administration clients  and the capital raised from the sale of the capital securities 
asset liquidity is also provided by managing the duration of the investment portfolio 
as a result of the company s management of liquid assets and the ability to generate liquidity through liability funds  management believes that the company maintains overall liquidity sufficient to meet its depositors needs  to satisfy its operating requirements and to fund the payment of an anticipated annual cash dividend of approximately 
per share 
the company s ability to pay dividends on the common stock depends on the receipt of dividends from investors bank trust company 
in addition  the company may not pay dividends on its common stock if it is in default under certain agreements entered into in connection with the sale of the capital securities 
any dividend payments by investors bank trust company are subject to certain restrictions imposed by the massachusetts commissioner of banks
