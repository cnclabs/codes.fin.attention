the trial in this matter was concluded in august damages were not specified in the court s decision  and it is unclear from the ruling whether the judgment is against all defendants and  if it is  whether tenera s share will be less than the total amount of the judgment 
based on the court s decision  however  the judgment ultimately entered by the court could aggregate in excess of  tenera anticipates that post trial proceedings will clarify the extent of its liability 
accordingly  for the year  the company accrued litigation judgment expenses of  related to this matter 
if tenera is ultimately held responsible for all or a significant portion of the total judgment entered by the court  such an outcome would have a material adverse impact on the cash flows of the company 
moreover  the judgment ultimately entered and the expense of an appeal of the court s judgment  if such an appeal is undertaken  could have a material adverse impact on the financial position  results of operations  and cash flows of the company

operating risks statements contained in this report which are not historical facts  are forward looking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected  including those risks and uncertainties discussed below 
history of losses  uncertainty of future profitability 
revenue decreased each year from to million in  million in  million in  million in  million in  and remained relatively flat from through revenue in decreased to million  which included million of technologies revenue prior to the asset sale 
net earnings loss from operations over the same periods declined from million in  to million in  million in  million in  million in  million in  million in  and million in there can be no assurance of the level of earnings  if any  that the company will be able to derive in the future 
reliance on major customers 
during fiscal  three customers  kaiser hill  comed  and pg e  accounted for approximately of the company s total revenues of non technologies revenue  and during  these three customers accounted for approximately of the company s total revenues of non technologies revenue 
all outstanding customer contracts are cancelable upon notice by either party  and therefore  there can be no assurance that relationships with customers will be maintained at existing levels  or at all 
the discontinuation or material reduction of business relations with any of these customers would have a material adverse impact on tenera s business

litigation 
plm financial services  inc filed an action in the superior court of california for the county of alameda  seeking damages in excess of million in unpaid equipment rent and other payments allegedly owing to plm under an equipment lease between plm and tera power corporation  a former subsidiary of tera corporation of the predecessor corporation 
plm named the company in the action pursuant to a guaranty of the lease obligations made by the predecessor corporation 
the trial in this matter was concluded in august  and in february  the trial judge issued a minute order rendering his decision against the defendants in the action 
damages were not specified in the court s decision and it is unclear from the ruling whether the judgment is against all defendants and  if it is  whether tenera s share will be less than the total amount of the judgment 
based on the court s decision  however  the judgment ultimately entered by the court could aggregate in excess of million 
tenera anticipates that post trial proceedings will clarify the extent of its liability 
if tenera is ultimately held responsible for all or a significant portion of the judgment entered by the court  such an outcome would have a material adverse impact on the cash flows of the company 
moreover  the judgment ultimately entered and the expense of an appeal of the court s judgment  if such an appeal is undertaken  could have a material adverse impact on the financial position  results of operations  and cash flows of the company 
further  there can be no assurance that such an appeal  if undertaken  would be successful 
see management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition  legal proceedings  and note to the financial statements 
uncertainty regarding industry trends and customer demand 
as a result of the slowdown in the construction of power plants and the absence of new power plants scheduled for construction  as well as the gradual deregulation of the production and distribution of electricity  the market for engineering services relating to licensing and construction of power plants has contracted  and the market for services related to efficient and profitable operation of existing capacity has expanded 
there can be no assurance that tenera will have the financial and other resources necessary to successfully research  develop  introduce  and market new products and services  that if  or when  such new products or services are introduced  they will be favorably accepted by current or potential customers  or that tenera will be otherwise able to fully adjust its services and products to meet the changing needs of the industry 
see business background 
uncertainty of access to capital 
management currently believes that cash expected to be generated from operations  the company s working capital  and its available loan facility  are adequate to meet its anticipated near term needs 
if cash from operations is less than currently anticipated  tenera may need to seek other sources of capital 
there can be no guarantee that such sources will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms favorable to tenera  or at all 
reliance on key personnel 
due to the nature of the consulting and professional services business  the company s success depends  to a significant extent  upon the continued services of its officers and key technical personnel and the ability to recruit additional qualified personnel 
the company experienced a historically high rate of turnover as revenue and earnings began to decline in and thereafter  and the further loss of such officers and technical personnel  and the inability to recruit sufficient additional qualified personnel could have material adverse effect on the company 
government contracts audits 
the company s united states government contracts are subject in all cases to audit by governmental authorities 
in  an audit was concluded  which began in  of certain of its government contracts with the doe relating to the allowability of certain employee compensation costs 
the company made a special charge to earnings in for a million provision for the potential rate adjustments then disputed by the company and the government 
as a result of resolving the dispute  the company recognized increases to earnings of  in and  in cash payments to clients associated with the settlement  which are estimated to be between  and  which were accrued for in the special charge to earnings  are expected to be made as government contracts with individual clients are closed out 
there can be no assurance that no additional charges to earnings of the company may result from future audits of the company s government contracts 
competition 
the market for management and consulting services is highly competitive and tenera competes with several larger firms with significantly greater resources 
significant competitive factors in the market for engineering and management services are price and the ability to offer new products and services designed to meet changing customer demand 
a number of tenera s competitors are able to offer such services at prices that are lower than those offered by tenera  and to devote far greater resources toward the development of new products and services 
this competition has had  and is expected to continue to have  a material adverse impact on tenera s business 
year issue 
many existing computer programs use only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
these programs were designed and developed without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century 
if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results by or at the year the year issue affects virtually all companies and organizations 
the company has reviewed the potential problem and believes that it will not have a material impact on its business operations nor its financial condition 
however  if the company s major clients have not addressed their own year issues adequately  especially regarding their accounts payable systems  payment of the company s invoices could be delayed and its cash flow materially affected
