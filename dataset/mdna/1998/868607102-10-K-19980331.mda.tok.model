item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
comparison of with revenues for increased to million from million in each one of the company s manufacturing facilities recorded revenue increases over those recorded in the strongest revenue increases were recorded at the company s goshen  indiana and jonestown  pennsylvania manufacturing facilities 
goshen is the company s largest manufacturing facility and offers the broadest product lines as compared to the other locations that offer primarily dry freight or refrigerated product lines 
pennsylvania s increase can be attributed to the fact it operates in the largest market for the company s products 
overall sales of the company s largest product line  dry freight vans  increased over the company s startrans trademark line of shuttle and mid size buses grew over the company s new product lines armored trucks  trolley buses and service vans contributed marginally to sales increases in and are expected to make a more meaningful contribution in the company s gross profit percentage was relatively unchanged in when compared to both raw material and direct labor costs increased nominally in when compared to overhead expenses declined as a percentage of revenues compared to  offsetting the increases in direct labor and materials 
the decline in overhead expenses is attributed to the fixed nature of certain expenses in the overhead pool that do not change proportionately when revenues increase as well as favorable variances between and in general insurance  workers compensation and group insurance expenses 
start up and training costs associated with the company s three new product lines contributed slightly to the increases in direct labor and overhead 
all are very labor intensive and also required an additional investment in raw material inventory 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million or of revenue compared with million or of revenue in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of million can be directly attributed to the increased revenue of million 
employee related costs accounted for approximately of the million increase in as compared to the percentage decline of to in as compared to in is attributed to those items in the selling  general and administrative category that do not change in response to changes in revenues 
interest expense declined 
million to million in from million in this decline resulted from less use of the company s revolving credit facility during most of as compared to  the pay off of million in real estate loans during and the reduction of million in a term note 
offsetting theses reductions were a full years interest on the company s california facility purchased in april the company s effective income tax rate of dropped from the comparable rate of in the effective tax rate decreased as the result of research and experimentation tax credits in the current year and the fact that approximately of last year s effective tax rate was attributable to the loss experienced at the honduran subsidiary which generated no tax benefit since the subsidiary is operating in a government free zone 
comparison of with revenues for declined to million from million recorded in the largest decreases occurred at the company s goshen manufacturing facilities where truck equipment products declined million and shuttle buses declined million 
the truck equipment decrease was primarily due to less overall industry wide demand 
the company s shuttle bus business was unfavorably effected by delays and reductions in orders from municipal customers 
the company s northeastern and southwestern markets recorded increases of approximately and respectively  which partially offset the decreases experienced elsewhere 
the company s gross profit percentage declined in to from in the company s raw material costs held constant over the year and improved slightly from as two price increases implemented during were in effect for all of offsetting the improvement in material costs were increases in both direct labor and overhead costs 
contributing to these increases were costs associated with the numerous projects the company has undertaken during dual rents and the cost of moving to a new manufacturing facility in california increased both labor and overhead 
labor and overhead were incurred in the start up of three new distribution facilities in louisville  st 
louis and denver 
also affecting labor and overhead were the development costs associated with the two new product lines  pro fleet conversions and freedom one trademark paratransit vans 
in addition  there were pre operating and start up costs incurred at both the fiberglass reinforced panel frp manufacturing facility and the honduran hardwood flooring plant while revenues from these facilities won t commence until selling  general and administrative expenses were million or of revenue compared with million or of revenue in the increase in selling expense of  can be attributed to additional sales staff at the new distribution facilities and also associated with the company s new product lines 
costs associated with the development of literature for the new product lines also contributed to the increase 
administrative costs increased  primarily due to the addition of the new distribution and manufacturing facilities as well as the new product lines 
interest expense declined  to  in from  in causing the decline was the conversion of the series b convertible debt to class a common stock as well as overall lower outstanding borrowings during the period 
the company used floating rate industrial revenue bonds to finance its california facility 
the rate at december  was 
the company s effective income tax rate of in was comparable to the rate in the slight increase is attributed to the net operating loss of the company s wholly owned subsidiary in honduras  for which there is no tax benefit since the honduran subsidiary is operating in a government free zone 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operations and funding under the company s revolving credit line were adequate to finance operations and provide for capital expenditures during cash flows from operating activities were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  net income combined with noncash charges for depreciation and amortization continue to be the main components generating operating cash flows 
the company used operating cash in all three years to finance increased inventory levels 
the increase in inventories of million in was directly related to the increase in revenues as well as the introduction of new product lines that use raw material components that the company did not previously stock 
the increase in inventory in was also revenue related while the increase in was caused by the need to carry chassis inventory to support the freedom one trademark and pro fleet product lines 
the increase in accounts receivable in of million was directly related to the increase in revenues 
in both and the increase in inventories was partially financed by increases in trade accounts payable while in the company used operating cash to reduce payables

during and cash flows from financing activities were primarily from the revolving line of credit  a million industrial revenue bond for the purchase of the california facility in as well as real estate mortgages related to specific acquisitions 
the company s million revolving line of credit increases to million from february to june the line of credit was structured in this manner to provide working capital to accommodate the large fleet orders that must be delivered in a very short time frame and to avoid paying commitment fees on the unused portion of the revolver over the balance of the year
