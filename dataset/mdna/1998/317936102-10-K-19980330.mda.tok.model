item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
general the company is a financial services organization principally engaged in mortgage loan origination  purchases  sales and servicing 
loans originated by the company primarily consist of fixed and adjustable rate loans secured by first mortgages on single family residences 
the company originates loans through its retail branch network which is currently comprised of offices in the united states seven of which are located in california  two of which are located in each of florida  illinois  maryland  new jersey  new york  and ohio and one of which is located in each of arizona  colorado  georgia  massachusetts  minnesota  oregon  pennsylvania  utah  virginia and washington and four offices in the united kingdom 
in addition  the company purchases loans from qualified mortgage originators 
the company sells loans to wholesale purchasers or securitizes them in trusts 
a significant portion of the company s loan production is securitized with the company retaining the right to service the loans 
in october the board of directors authorized a three for two split of its common stock to be effected in the form of a stock dividend 
the stock dividend was distributed on october  all share and per share information have been restated to reflect the stock dividend 
during the third quarter of  faco completed an initial public offering the ipo whereby  shares of its class a common stock were sold to the public 
concurrently   shares of the class b common stock of faco were issued in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of first alliance mortgage company famco as part of a reorganization whereby famco became a wholly owned subsidiary of faco 
the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the company for periods prior to the date of the reorganization substantially consist of those of famco 
prior to  the company sold its loans to private investors on a servicing retained basis 
since that time  the company has sold the majority of its loans in the secondary market primarily through securitization and  to a lesser extent  through whole loan sales in which the company does not retain the right to service the loans 
the company s underwriting guidelines require threshold credit criteria and combined ltv limits for loans sold through securitizations 
accordingly  the company sells on a servicing released basis those loans which do not meet its risk criteria for securitization 
the company retains the right to service loans which it has securitized 
the company s strategy of originating  as compared to purchasing  the majority of its loan volume results in the generation of a significant amount of loan origination fees 
this income has allowed the company to generate positive operating cash flow 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s operating cash flow will continue to be positive in the future 
certain accounting considerations as a fundamental part of its business and financing strategy  the company securitizes the majority of its loans in trusts whereby the loans are exchanged for regular and residual interests in the trusts 
a significant portion of the company s income is associated with securitization activity 
gains on servicing released whole loan sales equal the difference between the net proceeds to the company from such sales and the loans acquisition cost for purchased loans or net carrying value for originated loans 
the net carrying value of originated loans is equal to their principal balance less net deferred origination fees 
gains on servicing retained sales of loans through securitization represent the difference between the net proceeds to the company in the securitization and the allocated cost of loans securitized 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 the allocated cost of the loans securitized is determined by allocating their acquisition cost for purchased loans or net carrying value for originated loans between the loans securitized and the residual interests and the mortgage servicing rights retained by the company based upon their relative fair values 
at origination  the company classifies the residual interests as trading securities  which are carried at fair value 
the difference between the fair value of residual interests and their allocated cost is recorded as gain on securitization and is included in loan origination and sale revenue 
in a securitization  the company exchanges loans for regular interests and a residual interest in a trust 
the regular interests are immediately sold by the company to the public for cash 
as the holder of the residual interest  the company is entitled to receive certain excess cash flows 
these excess cash flows are the difference between a principal and interest paid by borrowers and b the sum of i scheduled principal and interest paid to holders of the regular interests  ii trustee fees  iii third party credit enhancement fees  iv servicing fees and v loan losses 
the company begins receiving these excess cash flows after certain overcollateralization requirements  which are specific to each securitization and are used as a means of credit enhancement  have been met 
the company carries residual interests at fair value 
as such  the carrying value of these securities is impacted by changes in market interest rates and prepayment and loss experiences of these and similar securities 
the company determines the fair value of the residual interests utilizing prepayment  credit loss and other assumptions appropriate for each particular securitization consistent with those an unrelated third party would utilize to value such securities 
to the company s knowledge  there is no active market for the sale of these residual interests 
the range of values attributable to the factors used in determining fair value is broad 
accordingly  the company s estimate of fair value is inherently subjective 
prepayments are expressed through a market convention known as an annual constant prepayment rate cpr 
in its past securitizations  the company has experienced a life to date cpr on securitized loans ranging from to 
non conforming mortgage loans  such as the company s loans  historically prepay at a faster rate than conforming mortgage loans 
at origination  the company utilizes prepayment assumptions ranging from to  an estimated annual loss assumption of and a weighted average discount rate of to value residual interests 
based upon the historical performance of its loans  the company expects its securitized pools to have average lives of three to five years 
as of december   the company s investments in residual interests totaled million 
to determine the fair value of mortgage servicing rights  the company computes the present value of projected net cash flows expected to be received over the life of the loans 
such projections incorporate assumptions  including servicing costs  prepayment rates and discount rates  consistent with those an unrelated third party would utilize to value such mortgage servicing rights 
these assumptions are similar to those used by the company to value residual interests 
the company periodically evaluates capitalized mortgage servicing rights for impairment  which is measured as the excess of unamortized cost over fair value 
this review is performed on a disaggregated basis by loan type 
the company has generally found that non conforming borrowers are payment sensitive rather than interest rate sensitive 
therefore  the company does not consider interest rates a predominant risk characteristic for purposes of evaluating impairment 
as of december   mortgage servicing rights totaled million 
the three primary components of the company s revenue are loan origination and sale  loan servicing and other fees and interest income 
loan origination and sale revenue consists of gain on sale of loans and the recognition of net deferred origination fees 
a significant portion of loan origination and sale revenue is the recognition upon sale of net deferred origination fees  which equaled million  or of loan origination and sale revenue during loan servicing and other fees represent management servicing fees and other ancillary fees  including prepayment penalties  received from servicing loans 
mortgage servicing rights are amortized against loan servicing and other fee revenue over the period of estimated net future servicing fee income 
interest income is comprised of two primary components i interest on loans held for sale during the warehousing period and ii the effective yield on residual interests 
the company recognizes interest income from residual interests on a level yield basis over the expected lives of the securitized loans 
at the end of each quarter  the company computes an effective yield based on the company s then current estimate of each residual interest s future cash flows 
this effective yield is used to accrue interest income in the subsequent quarter

additionally  the company initiated a strategy in june to purchase low ltv loans secured by property located near the company s retail offices for the purpose of marketing to these homeowners for additional borrowing needs 
purchases of low ltv loans totaled million in loan sales for the years ended december  dollars in thousands securitizations    whole loan sales    total    loan sales  including securitizations of loans  increased in and in these increases in loan sales were the result of the sale of the increased volume of loan originations and purchases

total revenues increased or million and or million in and  respectively  as compared to the corresponding prior periods primarily due to higher loan origination and sale revenue and  in  higher interest income from residual interests and loans held for sale 
loan origination and sale revenue increased in to million from million in  which increased from million in gain on sale of loans increased million in as compared to due to a increase in the volume of loans sold  an increase in the weighted average gain on loan sales and million recognized in as an increase in the fair value of residual interests 
the weighted average gain on sale of loans as a percentage of loan principal balances increased to in from in the weighted average gain on sale of loans securitized increased to in from in this increase is primarily due to an increase in the weighted average initial interest rate spread  an increase in the proportion of adjustable rate mortgages securitized and a decrease in the discount rate used in computing the fair value of the residual interests and mortgage servicing rights 
the weighted average initial interest rate spread the difference between the initial weighted average loan interest rates for the loans included in the securitization and the initial weighted average pass through rate paid to the holders of the regular interests in the securitization in residual interests originated increased to in from in as a percentage of total loans securitized  adjustable rate loans  which historically have generated larger interest rate spreads than fixed rate loans  increased to in from in a discount rate of was used to value residual interests and mortgage servicing rights in as compared to a rate of used in in addition  the weighted average gain on whole loan sales increased to of loans sold in as compared to in the company s whole loan sales consist of bulk sales  for which the company receives a premium over the principal balance of the loan  and flow sales  which represent individual loan sales for which the company generally recognizes no gain or loss 
the increase in the weighted average gain on whole loan sales is primarily the result of increases in the percentage of whole loan sales sold through bulk sales 
the increase in gain on sale of loans in as compared to was due to the increased volume of loans sold offset by lower premiums realized on loan sales 
the weighted average gain on sales of loans as a percentage of loan principal balances decreased to in from in this decrease was primarily due to decreased weighted average initial gross spreads in residual interests originated in securitizations which decreased to in from in gross spreads decreased due to increasing interest rates during the first half of as compared to decreasing interest rates during the first nine months of these decreased gross spreads were offset by the results of the company s hedging activities which had realized gains of million in as compared to realized losses of million in since april  the company has continuously hedged fixed rate loans held for sale and commitments to fund fixed rate loans 
net loan origination and other fees increased and in and  respectively  as compared to the corresponding prior periods as a result of the increased volume of sales of retail originations 
loan servicing and other fees as a percentage of the average servicing portfolio were  and in  and  respectively 
as a percentage of the average servicing portfolio  management fees decreased  prepayment penalties decreased and the amortization of mortgage servicing rights increased in as compared to the company earns higher management fees on loans serviced for private investors and for certain securitizations originated prior to as the proportion of loans serviced for private investors and securitizations originated prior to have decreased as a percentage of the total servicing portfolio  the company s weighted average management fees have decreased 
the decrease in prepayment penalties is primarily the result of a decrease  due to certain state and federal restrictions  in the percentage of loans on which the company collects prepayment penalties 
the increase in the amortization of mortgage servicing rights is due to the adoption in january of of sfas no 
accounting for mortgage servicing rights  which requires the company to capitalize the fair value of originated mortgage servicing rights and amortize the capitalized amount over the life of such assets 
interest income increased million  or  in as compared to the increase in interest income was due to a million increase in interest income from loans held for sale  a million increase in interest income from residual interest  and a million increase in interest income from short term investments 
the increases in interest income from loans held for sale and residual interests were primarily due to increases in the average balances of loans held for sale and residual interests during as compared to the increases in interest income from short term investments were primarily attributable in increases in the balance of available cash as a result of the ipo and cash generated from operations 
interest income decreased million  or  in as compared to interest income from loans held for sale and loans receivable held for investment decreased million due primarily to a decrease in the average balance of loans outstanding 
this was the result of a decrease in the average holding period of loans held for sale as the company completed securitizations in each quarter of  as compared to two securitizations in  and the paydown of loans receivable held for investment 
interest income from residual interests increased million due primarily to an increase in the average balance of residual interests 
expense the following table sets forth the components of the company s expenses for the years ended december dollars in thousands compensation and benefits    advertising    professional services and other fees    facilities and insurance    supplies    depreciation and amortization interest    legal   travel and training   other  total expense    total expenses increased  or million  and or million in and  respectively  as compared to the corresponding prior year periods primarily due to increases in expenses related to the company s continuing retail branch expansion 
the increase in compensation and benefits in and of million and million  respectively  were due primarily to increases in personnel to support the company s retail branch expansion 
in addition  in  the company reduced the use of outside telemarketing services and increased the number of employees in its internal telemarketing operations 
advertising expense increased  or million  in as compared to primarily due to increase in marketing activities resulting from the company s retail branch expansion 
the decrease in advertising expense in as compared to is due primarily to the reduction in the use of outside telemarketing services and the increase in the number of employees in the company s internal telemarketing operations 
professional services and other fees increased million  in as compared to primarily due to increases in recruiting costs and information systems consulting costs associated with the company s ongoing retail branch expansion and increases in costs associated with management of properties in foreclosure 
the increase in the costs associated with the management of properties in foreclosure is due to the increase in the proportion of properties in foreclosure located outside of california for which the company utilizes foreclosure service companies located in the same state as the property 
combined  facilities and insurance  supplies  and travel and training increased and in and  respectively  as compared to the corresponding prior periods primarily due to increases in expenses related to the company s continuing retail branch expansion 
the number of retail branch offices increased from at december  to at december  to at december  interest expense increased million in as compared to due primarily to an increase in interest expense on the warehouse financing facility of million 
the increase in interest expense on the warehouse financing facility is the result of a increase in the average balance outstanding on the warehouse line when compared to the prior year 
in addition  during  the company paid interest on s distribution notes of million 
no such notes were outstanding during interest expense decreased million in as compared to due primarily to a decrease in interest expense on the warehouse financing facilities of million offset by an increase of million in interest expense paid to stockholders related to stockholder notes payable and s distribution notes 
due to the increased frequency of securitizations in as compared to  the average outstanding balance of the warehouse financing facilities decreased resulting in a decrease in the related interest expense 
the increase in interest expense associated with stockholder notes payable and s distribution notes was due primarily to an increase in the average balance outstanding during which was due to the distribution of the s distribution notes in legal expense increased million in as compared to primarily due to legal costs incurred in resolving outstanding corporate litigation matters 
legal expense decreased million in as compared to primarily due to a million decrease in legal settlement costs 
other expenses in were million and million higher than the corresponding amounts in and  respectively 
these differences were primarily due to increase in losses realized on the sale of real estate owned reo in the increase in reo losses in reflect the company s decision to aggressively reduce the balance of its reo portfolio which decreased from million at december  to zero at december  income taxes from may  until the close of the ipo  the company had elected to be treated for federal income and certain state tax purposes as an s corporation under subchapter s of the internal revenue code and comparable state laws 
as a result  the company s provisions for income taxes during that period reflected modest corporate level state income taxes for those states in which the company operates 
the taxable income of the company during such periods has been included in the individual taxable income of its stockholders for federal and state income tax purposes 
the company s s corporation status was terminated in july and the company became subject to full corporate federal income and certain state income taxes 
in conjunction with the termination of the company s s corporation status  the company recorded million of net deferred tax assets related to temporary differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities measured by applying enacted tax rates and law to taxable years in which such temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
since the ipo  the company s effective income tax rate has approximated the federal and composite state income tax rates net of federal benefit 
if the company had been fully subject to federal and state income taxes  net income on a pro forma basis would have been million and million in and  respectively 
to date  all of the company s securitizations have been in the form of real estate mortgage investment conduit trusts 
in  the company intends to securitize its loans in owners trusts 
under an owners trust  the securitization of loans will be treated as a borrowing for state and federal tax purposes rather than as a sale 
to the extent that the gain on sale recorded on a securitization is greater the net interest income realized in the current period from the loans included in the related securitization  state and federal taxes will be deferred 
these deferred taxes will be payable in future periods as net interest income is realized for tax purposes 
the company believes that the use of owners trusts in its securitizations may significantly increase operating cash flow in servicing the following tables provide data on loan delinquency  reo and net losses for the company s servicing portfolio as of december  of of of dollars in servicing dollars in servicing dollars in servicing thousands portfolio thousands portfolio thousands portfolio servicing portfolio    days delinquent    days delinquent    days or more delinquent    total delinquencies    reo    for the years ended december  dollars in thousands average servicing portfolio    net losses   percentage of average servicing portfolio includes reo of the company as well as reo of the securitization trusts serviced by the company  however  excludes private investor reo not serviced by the company 
average servicing portfolio balance equals the quarterly average of the servicing portfolio computed as the average of the balance at the beginning and end of each quarter 
net losses represent losses realized with respect to disposition of reo 
the increase in loan losses in was principally due to disposition of properties acquired through foreclosures of wholesale loans purchased in and from certain originators from which the company no longer purchases loans 
liquidity and capital resources during the third quarter of  the company completed the ipo whereby  shares of class a common stock were sold resulting in gross proceeds of million 
after deducting underwriting discounts and costs of the ipo  the net proceeds of million were used to pay million of s distribution notes  to pay down million of the company s warehouse financing facilities and to fund current operations 
historically  the company has generated positive cash flow 
the company s sources of cash include loan sales  sales of regular interests  borrowings under its warehouse financing facilities  distributions received from residual interests  interest income and loan servicing income 
the company s uses of cash include the funding of loan originations and purchases  payments of interest  repayment of its warehouse financing facilities  capital expenditures  operating and administrative expenses and payment of income taxes 
the company generated pro forma operating cash flow of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
pro forma amounts reflect adjustments for state and federal income taxes as if the company had been taxed as a c corporation for periods prior to the ipo 
the following table shows the computation of operating cash flow and provides a reconciliation of operating cash flow to net cash provided by used in operating activities as it is included in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended december dollars in thousands pro forma net income    non cash adjustments to reconcile pro forma net income to pro forma net operating cash flow capitalized residual interests and mortgage servicing rights    net accretion of residual interests in securities   amortization of mortgage servicing rights   deferred income taxes   depreciation and amortization other operating cash flow    reconciliation to consolidated statements of cash flows operating cash flow    increase decrease in loans held for sale    changes in other assets and liabilities    adjustment for pro forma income tax provision   net cash provided by used in operating activities    the loan origination and processing fees charged to the borrower are included in the principal balance of the loan originated 
the company funds such loans out of available cash or through its warehouse financing facilities 
for loans financed through available cash  the company receives its loan origination and processing fees in cash upon sale of the loan 
for loans financed through the warehouse financing facilities  the company generally receives substantially all of the loan origination and processing fees in cash at the time of the warehouse financing facility borrowing 
the company s warehouse financing facilities provide  in the aggregate  up to million in the united states and up to ukp million in the united kingdom in repurchase agreements or secured revolving lines of credit which are used to finance loan originations and purchases 
the company s ability to continue to originate and purchase loans is dependent upon adequate credit facilities and upon its ability to sell the loans in the secondary market in order to generate cash proceeds for new originations and purchases 
the value of and market for the company s loans are dependent upon a number of factors  including general economic conditions  interest rates and governmental regulations 
adverse changes in such factors may affect the company s ability to sell loans for acceptable prices within a reasonable period of time 
a prolonged  substantial reduction in the size of the secondary market for loans of the type originated or purchased by the company may adversely affect the company s ability to sell loans in the secondary market with a consequent adverse impact on the company s results of operations  financial condition and ability to fund future originations and purchases 
the company s warehouse financing facilities consist of four separate agreements a million facility  a million facility  a million facility and a million ukp facility

in february  the company entered into master repurchase agreements to provide warehouse financing facilities to two mortgage banking companies borrowers that are controlled by related parties 
these facilities are secured by loans originated by the borrowers and by personal guarantees provided by stockholders of the borrowers  bear interest at per annum  have a combined borrowing limit of million and expire in october as of december   an aggregate of million was outstanding on these lines 
in april  the board of directors of the company authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of class a common stock in open market transactions 
in connection with this program  the company repurchased million shares of its class a common stock for million during in january  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional million shares of the company s class a common stock 
as of december   the company had commitments to fund loans of million 
historically  approximately of such commitments have ultimately been funded 
capital expenditures totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  the company purchased an office building for million to house the company s telemarketing operations 
prior to the ipo  the company paid dividends  including amounts to be used by the stockholders for the payment of personal income tax on the earnings of the s corporation 
in this regard  the company paid dividends of million and million in and  respectively 
in addition  in  the company distributed s distribution notes to the stockholders of the company totaling million 
proceeds from the ipo were used to pay the s distribution notes in since the completion of the ipo in july the company has been taxed as a c corporation and no cash dividends have been declared 
the company believes that cash flows from operations  net proceeds from securitizations and whole loan sales and the availability of funds under the warehouse financing facilities will be sufficient to fund operating needs and capital expenditures for the ensuing months 
year issue the company has performed a preliminary review of its computer systems and hardware to identify processes which may be affected by year problems 
during and  the company plans to complete this review  make changes where needed and test its computer systems and hardware to ensure the company s systems are year compliant 
during and  the company will also complete a year review of its relationships with suppliers and financial institutions and obtain assurance  where necessary  that these entities are year compliant 
because the majority of the company s computer systems and hardware have been purchased or developed recently and were designed to be year compliant  the company does not expect to incur significant costs in addressing the year issue
