item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview prior to fiscal  a significant portion of the company s product sales  gross profit and operating expenses was related to its general purpose co surgical lasers  laser components and related accessories 
the company exited this part of its surgical laser business by the end of to focus its full resources on the heart laser system 
the exit strategy included fulfilling existing contracts and orders  and a sale of technologies associated with a part of this business 
the company has both a placement strategy and a direct distributor sales strategy for heart laser system purchases 
the placement program allows the company to receive recurring revenues based on the usage of the heart laser system rather than one time revenues for the sale of each heart laser system 
under the placement model  an installation fee is paid when the heart laser system is installed and the company then receives a fee per use 
sterile handpieces and other disposables are included in the per procedure fee 
revenues from these contracts are classified as placement fees 
the cost of the heart laser system is depreciated over the term of the contract 
in the near term  it is expected that placement revenues will continue to be impacted by reimbursement policies until the us food and drug administration fda approval is granted 
in foreign countries where credit risk is high or where health care is not reimbursed by the government or insurance  the heart laser system is sold as capital equipment and the related sterile handpieces and other disposables are sold separately for each procedure 
the company sells heart laser systems directly and through distributors 
these sales are classified as product sales 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues of  for the year ended december  decreased  or when compared to total revenues of  for the year ended december  for the year ended december   product sales of  decreased  or when compared to product sales of  for the year ended december  the major factors in both of these year to date decreases are the number of heart laser systems sold and the customer mix 
in  the company recorded revenue on ten heart laser systems under the sales strategy of which two were sold directly and eight were sold to distributors as compared to revenue recorded on heart laser systems under the sales strategy in of which six were sold directly and seven were sold to distributors 
heart laser systems sold directly to customers typically generate higher revenues than those sold to distributors 
placement and service fees of  for the year ended december  increased over placement and service fees of  for the year ended december  although the company has increased its placement contract base  revenue dollars have not proportionately increased 
the company generates a revenue stream over the life of the placement contract 
typically  the revenue generated in the initial periods of the contract are less than in later periods when premarket approval pma approval is anticipated and minimum contractual billings are increased 
in may  the health care financing administration hcfa instituted a non coverage policy for tmr procedures performed on medicare patients in the united states 
the hcfa announcement coupled with the july  fda advisory panel recommendation of non approval caused the company to reexamine its requirement of contractual minimum billings prior to fda approval 
as a result  the company permitted a slowdown in the contractual minimum billings to an actual usage billing 
until pma approval  of which no assurance can be given  the company expects that future billings under placement contracts will be impacted similarly and the effect on future revenue on existing contracts cannot be predicted 
total gross profit decreased to  or of total revenues for the year ended december  as compared with  or of total revenues for the year ended december  gross profit on product sales decreased to  or of product sales for the year ended december  from  or of product sales for the year ended december  this overall decrease has resulted primarily from three factors 
first  in september  the company moved into a new facility to accommodate higher levels of manufacturing in anticipation of fda approval 
in  the company continued to increase overall staffing and other related fixed manufacturing costs  which in turn caused overall manufacturing spending to be higher in than in coupled with lower levels of production in than in the combination of these factors resulted in unfavorable capacity and manufacturing variances in  which caused a deterioration in the gross margin 
the company anticipates that after pma approval  of which no assurance can be given  production levels will increase to levels that will absorb manufacturing overhead and mitigate these variances 
secondly  as previously discussed  the company shipped fewer units under its sales strategy in than in and the mix was primarily to distributors in as compared to direct sales in heart laser systems sold directly to customers typically carry a higher gross profit than those sold to distributors 
thirdly  the company generated less gross margin dollars from placement contracts in than in as discussed below 
gross profit on placement and service fees of  or of total revenues for the year ended december  decreased  when compared to  or of total revenues for the year ended december  the company s existing placement contracts are in the pre pma contractual minimum billings period  which are typically lower than minimums required after pma approval  of which no assurance can be given  at which time annual minimums increase 
the cost of the laser is charged on a straight line basis over the life of the placement contract 
the overall depreciation on heart laser systems under existing placement contracts is increasing at a faster rate than the corresponding revenue generated due to the lower pre pma minimum billings 
this has resulted in a lower gross margin in as compared to until such time that the company sees an increase to its minimum billings on existing and future placement contracts  the gross margin is expected to be negatively impacted 
selling  general and administrative expenses of  for the year ended december  increased  or when compared with  for the year ended december  the company continues to prepare for an fda panel review of the pma application for the heart laser system 
in  the company expanded its management team  and as well as its sales force 
the company feels these additional expenditures are necessary and should enable the company to be well positioned for the us launch of the heart laser system upon approval from the fda  of which no assurance can be given 
research and development expenditures of  increased  or for the year ended december  when compared with  for the year ended december  the company continues to make expenditures with its clinical study compilation and data preparation for fda submissions 
these activities have required additional staffing and consultants in for these growing demands 
in addition  the company continues its investments in the research and development of new products 
other income of  for the year ended december  decreased  or when compared to  for the year ended december  included in other income is interest income  interest expense and other expense 
interest income was  in and  in the slight decrease in interest income is a result of a lower average cash and marketable securities balances in than in interest expense was  in and  in in july and august  the company received million in net proceeds from the issuance of convertible debentures 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company recorded interest expense on the outstanding debentures throughout the year 
other expense was  in and  in included in other expense are gains and losses from foreign currency transactions 
there was no provision for income tax for the year ended december  or due to the net loss of  and  respectfully 
the company incurred a net loss for the year ended december  of  when compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  this is a result of lower total revenues in when compared with  coupled with higher overall expenses in related to preparation for the pma approval process 
the 
and 
loss per share for the years ended december  and  respectively  was calculated using only the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues of  for the year ended december  decreased  or when compared to total revenues of  for the year ended december  for the year ended december   product sales of  decreased  or when compared to product sales of  for the year ended december  the major factors in both of these year to date decreases are the number of heart lasers shipped and the method of sale 
in  there were units shipped  of which were sales  as compared with shipped in  of which were sales 
in addition  in  the company had a significant sale to a distributor imatron japan imatron of six heart lasers at approximately million 
in  the company did not have a comparable contract with imatron or any other distributor 
placement and service fees of  for the year ended december  increased over placement and service fees of  for the year ended december  which reflects an increase in the number of heart lasers under placement contracts 
in the company had a total of heart lasers under placement contracts as compared with a total of in total gross profit decreased to  or of total revenues for the year ended december  as compared with  or of total revenues for the year ended december  gross profit on product sales decreased to  or of product sales for the year ended december  from  or of product sales for the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin dollars is a function of lower product sales discussed previously 
the gross margin percentage on product sales increased slightly in as compared with during the year ended december   the company expensed certain inventory related with the exit strategy of its general purpose co surgical laser product line  which had an unfavorable impact on the gross margin percentage in gross profit on placement and service fees of  or for the year ended december  increased  when compared to  or for the year ended december  in  the company had a majority of its placement contracts in their first contract year 
the first year of a placement contract generally produces lower annual minimum contractual revenues than in subsequent years 
in addition  the company records installation revenue at the commencement of the placement contract 
in  the timing of both of these factors reflected a lower gross margin percentage when compared to selling  general and administrative expenses of  for the year ended december  increased  or when compared with  for the year ended december  in  the company expanded its international sales and marketing efforts with the establishment of four international subsidiaries in europe and asia  which accounted for more than one third of the overall increase 
in addition to the expansion internationally  the company has also strengthened its domestic marketing efforts  increased overall staffing  and moved its operations to a new  square foot facility 
research and development expenditures of  increased  or for the year ended december  when compared with  for the year ended december  the increase is primarily related to increased staffing requirements associated with growing demands for clinical study compilation and the development of a second generation heart laser system 
other income of  for the year ended december  decreased  or when compared to  for the year ended december  this decrease is the result of lower interest income due to lower interest rates throughout as compared to in addition  with the establishment of the company s new subsidiaries in  foreign currency transactions resulted in a  loss for the year ended december  there was no provision for income tax for the year ended december  due to the net loss of  although the company had sufficient net operating loss carryforwards to offset income taxes for the year ended december   the provision for income taxes represents the tax liability under the alternative minimum tax regulations which cannot be offset by net operating loss carryforwards 
the company incurred a net loss for the year ended december  of  when compared to net income of  for the year ended december  this is a result of lower total revenues in when compared with  coupled with higher overall expenses in related to both international and domestic expansion 
the 
loss per share for the year ended december  was calculated using only the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year 
earnings per share of 
for the year ended december  was calculated using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  and short term investments of  in july and august  the company received  in net proceeds through the issuance of convertible debentures due july and august in september  of these debentures were converted into the company s common stock 
in january and february  the remaining  of these debentures converted into the company s common stock 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
during the year ended december   the company incurred a loss of  which resulted in the use of approximately  to support operations 
cash used in investing activities was approximately  primarily related to the net purchase of  of marketable securities from the proceeds of the convertible debentures discussed previously 
in addition  the company invested  in fixed assets  primarily related to its placement contract activity 
cash provided by financing activities was approximately  primarily related to the net proceeds of  through the issuance of convertible debentures and  from proceeds of the sale of the company s common stock 
during the year ended december   the company received approximately  in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants  and  from the repayment of shareholder loans 
an additional  of cash was generated from the maturities of short term investments which were not reinvested 
cash provided from operating activities approximated  principally related to its collection in january of its  outstanding receivable from imatron  offset by investments in inventories  and increases in prepaid expenses and other assets 
approximately  was used to acquire capital equipment  principally heart lasers used for placement contracts coupled with leasehold improvements related to the company s new facility 
on september   the company moved into its new facility in franklin  massachusetts under a five year operating lease 
in february  the company s pma was filed by the fda 
in anticipation of a possible fda approval  the company had been increasing its overall operating expenses and overhead to be positioned to further increase its production capacities 
in order to be adequately positioned to meet these demands  the company secured financing in july on july   an fda advisory panel recommended a non approval at that meeting with the requirement of additional data to complete the randomized study 
in december  the company submitted all of the data on the heart laser system to the fda and its advisory panel from the request of the july  fda advisory panel meeting 
the company has been notified of a scheduled fda advisory panel date on april  given this delay  the company has monitored its operating expenses closely and minimized increases to expenses and overhead during this period 
with the million in cash and marketable securities at december   the company believes that it has sufficient resources to meet its working capital demands for at least the next twelve months 
the company and certain of its officers have been named as defendants in purported class action lawsuits filed between august and november see note to the consolidated financial statement and item legal proceedings for further discussion 
the company has an insurance policy of which the maximum deductible has been recorded in the results of operations for the year ended unanticipated decreases in operating revenues  increases in expenses  or a further delay in the expected fda approval  may adversely impact the company s cash position 
the company may seek additional financing through the issuance and sale of debt or equity securities  bank financing  joint ventures or by other means 
the availability of such financing and the reasonableness of any related terms in comparison to market conditions cannot be assured 
for the reasons discussed above  the company believes that operating losses are likely until after such time as the company receives its pma from the fda for the heart laser system 
although the heart laser system has been granted expedited review status by the fda  the company cannot project when  if at all  such approval will be granted or that any approval will include desirable claims 
any failure or delay in receiving any such approval would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the company must also convince health care professionals  third party payors and the general public of the medical and economic benefits of the heart laser system 
no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in marketing the heart laser system or that the company will be able to operate profitably on a consistent basis 
this report contains forward looking statements regarding anticipated increases in revenues  marketing of products and proposed products and other matters 
these statements  in addition to statements made in conjunction with the words anticipate  expect  intend  believe  seek  estimate and similar expressions are forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
the following is a list of factors  among others  that would cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements approval by the fda  successful ability to secure any required additional financing  business conditions and growth in certain market segments and general economy  an increase in competition  increased or continued market acceptance of the company s products and proposed products  and other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
at december   the company had us net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million available to reduce future taxable income which expire at various dates through  and the company had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
in addition  various other deferred tax assets have been generated related primarily to intercompany profit  accruals  and research and development tax credits 
since the company believes that as of december  it is more likely than not  that all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  no tax benefit for prior year losses and other deferred items has been provided 
these amounts could provide a benefit to the company in the future in profitable years  subject to the expirations noted 
the year issue refers to potential problems with computer systems or any equipment with computer chips or software that uses dates where the date has been stored as just two digits eg  for 
on january   any clock or date recording mechanism incorporating date sensitive software which uses only two digits to represent the year may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruption of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar business activities 
the company is presently evaluating the impact of the year issue as it affects business operations  interfaces with customers and vendors  and contingencies related to products that have been sold that may need to be modified 
to date  the company is unaware of any situations of noncompliance that would materially adversely effect its operations or financial condition 
there can be no assurance  however  that instances of noncompliance which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations or financial condition will not be identified  that the systems of other companies with which the company transacts business will be corrected on a timely basis  or that failure by such entities to correct a year problem or a correction which is incompatible with the company s information systems would not have a material adverse effect on the company s operations and financial condition
