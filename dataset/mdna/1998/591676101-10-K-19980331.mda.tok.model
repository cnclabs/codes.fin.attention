since  the company has experienced a growth in revenues with a significant percentage of its revenues derived from international sales 
results of operations since the beginning of the company has been exposed to overall unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations due to the reduction in the value of the german mark against the us dollar 
the exchange rate at january  was approximately german marks to one us dollar compared to approximately german marks to one us dollar at december   a reduction in value of approximately since the beginning of the year  the effect of which was partially offset by an increase in product sales prices in europe as of april  during the third quarter of  the exchange rate was as high as german marks to one us dollar 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company translates its statement of operations utilizing average exchange rates for reported periods 
the company s german subsidiary accounted for approximately of the company s consolidated sales for the year ended december  substantially all of the german subsidiary s products are manufactured at the company s us facility 
therefore  the subsidiary s product manufacturing costs  which represent approximately of the subsidiary s total costs for the year ended december   are incurred by the company in us dollars 
as a result  the subsidiary s sales are significantly affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the german mark and the us dollar  however  there is a minimal offsetting effect in the product costs of the subsidiary 
accordingly  the company s consolidated operating profit is significantly affected by changes in the exchange rate between the german mark and us dollar 
see liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of the company s derivative financial instruments utilized to mitigate such exposure 
notwithstanding the effect of the fluctuations in the exchange rate between the german mark to the us dollar  the company s sales derived from its german subsidiary denominated in german marks increased for the year ended december  over year ended december  compared to year ended december  amounts in thousands except per share information sales increased to  in from  in  principally as a result of the continued increase in market acceptance of the company s hand held scanners  scan engines sold to oem s  holotrak holographic industrial scanners  and increased sales and marketing efforts 
the increase in sales was offset by lower average unit selling prices compared to the corresponding period a year ago  primarily on certain of the company s point of sale pos products  which average unit selling prices included significant unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations from the company s german subsidiary

cost of sales increased to  in from  in  and cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased to from 
these increases were due primarily to a reduction in the average selling prices on certain of the company s products  which average unit selling prices included the unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations noted above 
an additional factor negatively affecting cost of sales includes initial production and setup costs associated with holotrak industrial scanners for which sales levels had not yet achieved sufficient levels to fully absorb these costs 
the increases in cost of sales were partly offset by reduced product costs resulting from engineering enhancements to certain products and manufacturing efficiencies resulting from greater unit volumes 
if sales are adjusted to negate the effect of unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations since the beginning of  cost of sales as a percentage of sales would have been in compared with in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to  in from  in and increased as a percentage of sales to from

the company s liquidity has been  and may continue to be  adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
since december   the company and its german subsidiary have been exposed to unfavorable foreign currency exchange fluctuations as a result of a decline in the value of the german mark against the us dollar 
in an effort to mitigate the financial implications of the volatility in the exchange rate between the german mark and the us dollar  the company increased product sales prices in europe as of april   and has selectively entered into derivative financial instruments to offset its exposure to foreign currency risks 
derivative financial instruments currently include i foreign currency forward exchange contracts with its primary bank for periods not exceeding six months  which partially hedge sales to its german subsidiary  and ii a german mark based term loan which acts as a partial hedge against outstanding intercompany receivables and the net assets of its german subsidiary which are denominated in german marks 
additionally  the german subsidiary invoices and receives payment in certain other major european currencies  which results in an additional mitigating measure that reduces the company s exposure to the fluctuation between the german mark and the us dollar 
the company believes that its current cash and cash equivalent balances  along with cash generated from operations and availability under its revolving credit facilities  will be adequate to fund the company s operations through at least the next twelve months 
impact of year the company s management information systems mis were written using two digits  rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  the company s computer system and programs have time sensitive software that recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could cause a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company is planning to replace its current mis system with a new  year compliant  fully integrated mis system for itself  its subsidiaries  and other affiliated companies 
the total cost of the new mis system will be approximately  a substantial portion of which will be capitalized 
the new mis system is estimated to be fully implemented by june  which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
the costs of the new mis system and the date on which the company believes it will complete its implementation are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
forward looking information the discussion in this form k includes forward looking statements based on current management expectations 
factors which could cause the results to differ from these expectations include the following general economic conditions  competitive factors and pricing pressures  technological changes in the scanner industry  fluctuations in the exchange rate between the german mark and the us dollar  the company s ability to enter into and settle forward exchange contracts  availability of patent protection for the company s holographic scanners and other products  and market acceptance of the company s new products 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income and sfas no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas establishes standards for reporting comprehensive income 
the company adopted sfas  which had no impact on net income or shareholders equity  at december  sfas requires foreign currency translation adjustments  which prior to adoption were reported separately in shareholders equity  to be included in other comprehensive income 
prior year financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the requirements of sfas sfas establishes standards for annual and interim disclosures of operating segments  products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
sfas is effective in the company is in the process of evaluating the disclosure requirements of sfas  the adoption of which will have no impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition
