results of operations revenues the following table sets forth for the fiscal periods indicated a the percentage of revenues represented by fixed price and usage priced revenues from the credit business unit  and the percentage of revenues contributed by the dynamark  rmt  insurance and healthcare business units  and b the percentage change in revenues within each category from the prior fiscal year 
credit fixed price revenues include all revenues from custom scorecard  software and consulting projects 
most credit usage revenues are generated through third party alliances such as those with credit bureaus and third party credit card processors 
in addition  some credit scorecards and software products are licensed under volume based fee arrangements and these are included in credit usage priced revenues 
percentage of period to period revenue percentage changes years ended september  to to credit fixed price usage priced dynamark rmt insurance healthcare less than nm total revenues not meaningful revenues from credit application scoring products increased by percent in fiscal compared with fiscal  and decreased by percent in fiscal compared with fiscal the increase in fiscal was due primarily to the company s sales of new products and increased sales of small business loan scoring products 
the decrease in revenues in fiscal reflected the impact of bank consolidations 
asap revenues increased by percent in fiscal compared with fiscal  and by percent in fiscal compared with fiscal  primarily due to increased sales of pc based asap products creditdesk and sales of the strategyware r decision support system 
revenues from sales of credit account management systems triad sold to end users decreased by percent from fiscal to fiscal  and increased by percent from fiscal l to fiscal l the major factor in the decline in revenues in fiscal l was a delay in the completion of the next major release of the software 
the increase in fiscal was due primarily to the release of the next version of triad triad in november l the company s high degree of success in penetrating the us bankcard industry with these products has limited  and may continue to limit  the revenue growth in that market 
however  the company has added functionality for the existing base of triad users and is actively marketing triad for other types of credit products and in overseas markets 
the company provides credit risk management consulting services primarily through crma  which it acquired in september crma completed its second year as part of the credit business unit on september  l crma s revenues increased by percent in fiscal l compared with fiscal and comprised approximately percent of the company s credit revenues in fiscal as compared to percent in fiscal l usage revenues are generated primarily by credit scoring services distributed through major credit bureaus and credit account management services distributed through third party bankcard processors 
revenues from credit bureau related services increased percent in both fiscal l and fiscal and accounted for approximately percent of revenues in fiscal and revenues from services provided through bankcard processors also increased in each of these years  primarily due to increases in the number of accounts at each of the major processors 
revenues derived from alliances with credit bureaus and credit card processors have accounted for much of the company s revenue growth in the last three years 
while the company has been very successful in extending or renewing such agreements in the past  and believes it will generally be able to do so in the future  the loss of one or more such alliances or an adverse change in terms could have a significant impact on revenues and operating margin 
revenues generated through the company s alliances with equifax  inc  experian information solutions  inc  formerly trw information systems services and trans union corporation each accounted for approximately to percent of the company s total revenues in fiscal and  and approximately to percent of the company s total revenues in fiscal in experian was acquired by ccn group ltd  a subsidiary of great universal stores  plc 
ccn is the company s largest competitor  worldwide  in the area of credit scoring 
trw experian has offered scoring products developed by ccn in competition with those of the company for several years 
the acquisition had no apparent impact on the company s revenues from experian in fiscal and l on september   amendments to the federal fair credit reporting act became effective 
the company believes these changes to the federal law regulating credit reporting will be favorable to the company and its clients 
among other things  the new law expressly permits the use of credit bureau data to prescreen consumers for offers of credit and insurance and allows affiliated companies to share consumer information with each other subject to certain conditions 
there is also a seven year moratorium on new state legislation on certain issues 
however  the states remain free to regulate the use of credit bureau data in connection with insurance underwriting 
the company believes enacted or proposed state regulation of the insurance industry has had a negative impact on its efforts to sell insurance risk scores through credit reporting agencies 
dynamark s revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and to million in fiscal the increases in dynamark s revenues excluding intercompany revenues were due primarily to increased revenues from customers in the financial services industry 
gross margins for fiscal  and were approximately  and percent  respectively 
since its acquisition  dynamark has taken on an increasing share of the mainframe batch processing requirements of the company s other business units 
during each of fiscal and  such intercompany revenue represented approximately percent of dynamark s total revenues  and in fiscal such revenue represented approximately percent of dynamark s total revenues 
accordingly  dynamark s externally reported revenues may tend to understate dynamark s growth and contribution to the company as a whole 
rmt s revenues for fiscal l increased by percent compared with fiscal l  and in fiscal decreased by percent compared with fiscal  due primarily to the impact of bank consolidations 
increases in insurance revenues for fiscal l  compared with fiscal  were due to strong growth in both insurance products sold to end users and in the insurance scoring services offered through consumer reporting agencies 
in fiscal  the company recorded its first revenues from its healthcare business unit  and during fiscal derived revenues from providing analytical marketing services to a large pharmaceuticals manufacturer to help improve customer relationships and management of prescription compliance ie  a patient s fulfillment of prescriptions and taking them to completion 
the company s revenues derived from clients outside the united states increased from million in to million in fiscal l and to million in fiscal rmt contributed million  million and million to the company s non us revenues for fiscal years  l and l  respectively 
dynamark has not had significant non us revenues 
sales of software products  including triad and creditdesk  increased usage of credit bureau scores in canada  and an increase in the number of accounts using the company s account management services at credit card processors in europe and latin america accounted for most of the increase in international revenues in fiscal and gains or losses due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates have not been significant to date but may become more important if  as expected  the proportion of the company s revenues denominated in foreign currencies increases in the future 
revenues from software maintenance and consulting services each accounted for less than percent of revenues in each of the three years in the period ended september   and the company does not expect revenues from either of these sources to exceed percent of revenues in the foreseeable future 
during the period since  while the rate of account growth in the us bankcard industry has been slowing and many of the company s largest institutional clients have merged and consolidated  the company has generated above average growth in revenues even after adjusting for the effect of acquisitions from its bankcard related scoring and account management business by deepening its penetration of large banks and other credit issuers 
the company believes much of its future growth prospects will rest on its ability to a develop new  high value products  b increase its penetration of established or emerging credit markets outside the us and canada and c expand either directly or through further acquisitions into relatively undeveloped or underdeveloped markets for its products and services  such as direct marketing  insurance  small business lending and healthcare information management 
during fiscal  the company s backlog of orders for fixed priced products declined slightly 
this indicates that revenue growth in fiscal and later years may depend to a large extent on sales of newly developed products 
over the long term  in addition to the factors discussed above  the company s rate of revenue growth excluding growth due to acquisitions is limited by the rate at which it can recruit and absorb additional professional staff 
management believes this constraint will continue to exist indefinitely 
on the other hand  despite the high penetration the company has already achieved in certain markets  the opportunities for application of its core competencies are much greater than it can pursue 
thus  the company believes it can continue to grow revenues  within the personnel constraint  for the foreseeable future 
at times management may forego short term revenue growth in order to devote limited resources to opportunities that it believes have exceptional long term potential 
this occurred in the period from through  when the company devoted significant resources to developing the usage priced services distributed through credit bureaus and third party processors 
expenses the following table sets forth for the fiscal periods indicated a the percentage of net revenues represented by certain line items in the company s consolidated statements of income and b the percentage change in the amount of each such line item from the prior fiscal year 
percentage of period to period revenue percentage changes years ended september  to to total revenues costs and expenses cost of revenues sales and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization of intangibles total costs and expenses income from operations other income expense nm nm income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income not meaningful cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel  travel and related overhead costs  costs of computer service bureaus  and the amounts paid by the company to credit bureaus for scores and related information in connection with the scorenet r service 
cost of revenues  as a percentage of revenues  declined slightly in the periods from fiscal l to fiscal and from fiscal l to fiscal the decrease in both fiscal l and fiscal was due primarily to the reassignment to research and development activities of certain personnel whose primary assignment had been production and delivery 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist principally of personnel  travel  overhead  advertising and other promotional expenses 
as a percentage of revenues  sales and marketing expenses decreased in fiscal compared with fiscal due primarily to a reduction in media advertising and remained essentially unchanged from fiscal to fiscal research and development research and development expenses include the personnel and related overhead costs incurred in product development  researching mathematical and statistical algorithms and developing software tools that are aimed at improving productivity and management control 
research and development increased sharply from fiscal l to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal after several years of concentrating on developing new markets either geographically or by industry for its existing technologies  in fiscal and fiscal l the company renewed its historical emphasis on developing new technologies  especially in the area of software development 
in fiscal  the company continued to emphasize development of new technologies 
research and development expenditures in fiscal were primarily related to new bankruptcy scoring products for visa integrated solutions concepts and trans union  new fraud detection software products  joint product development projects with deluxe financial services  inc  healthcare receivables management and year compliance work 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist mainly of compensation expenses for certain senior management  corporate facilities expenses  the costs of administering certain benefit plans  legal expenses  expenses associated with the exploration of new business opportunities and the costs of operating administrative functions  such as finance and computer information systems 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses were essentially unchanged for fiscal l  l and l amortization of intangibles the company is amortizing the intangible assets arising from various acquisitions over periods ranging from to years 
the level of amortization expense in future years will depend  in part  on the amount of additional payments to the former shareholders of crma  a privately held company acquired at the end of fiscal l see below  under capital resources and liquidity 
other income expense the table in note to the consolidated financial statements presents the detail of other income and expenses 
interest income is derived from the investment of funds surplus to the company s immediate operating requirements 
at september   the company had approximately million invested in us treasury securities and other interest bearing instruments 
interest income increased in both fiscal and due to higher average cash balances in interest bearing accounts and instruments 
the company s share of operating losses in certain early stage development companies that are accounted for using the equity method is charged to other expense 
during the fiscal year ended september  l  the company wrote off non marketable investments with an equity basis of  primarily related to an italian start up venture that was adversely affected by a new privacy law 
in fiscal year ended september   the company liquidated its share of this non marketable security resulting in a gain of  and has no further financial commitments in connection with this investment 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the company s investment in such companies 
in fiscal  the difference between the increase in operating income percent and the increase in net income percent was primarily due to the interest income derived from investments in us treasury securities and other interest bearing instruments  and the absence of losses from investments in start ups 
provision for income taxes the company s effective tax rate was  and percent in fiscal l  and l  respectively 
the increase to percent in fiscal was due primarily to the nondeductible nature of goodwill  deferred compensation and an increase in the effective state tax rate 
the company expects its effective tax rate in fiscal to be approximately percent  barring any change in the tax laws 
capital resources and liquidity working capital increased from  at september   to  at september  l  and to  at september  the increase in fiscal was due primarily to increases in accounts receivable and unbilled work in progress  which more than offset the increase in accrued compensation and employee benefits and the decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets 
the increase in fiscal was due primarily to increases in short term investments  unbilled work in progress and accounts receivable  which more than offset the increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities and accrued compensation and employee benefits 
the company s exposure to collection risks is comprised of the sum of accounts receivable plus unbilled work in progress  less billings in excess of earned revenues 
changes in contract terms and product mix  along with variations in timing  may cause fluctuations in any or all of these items 
during fiscal  the increases in accounts receivable and billings in excess of earned revenues were proportional to the increase in revenues 
the greater increase in unbilled work in progress was due primarily to changes in product mix and contract terms 
during fiscal  the increase in accounts receivable was proportionally much less than the increase in revenues due to improved collection efforts by the company  and the increases in unbilled work in progress and billings in excess of earned revenues were proportional to the increase in revenues 
the company capitalized  as goodwill relating to amounts due to the former stockholders of crma under the crma purchase agreement based upon its financial results in fiscal  and has capitalized  based upon crma s financial results in fiscal an additional payment to the former stockholders of crma based upon crma s financial results in fiscal may also be required 
that amount  which will be paid percent in company stock and percent in cash  will not exceed  in fiscal  cash provided by operations resulted primarily from net income before depreciation and amortization  decreases in prepaid expenses and other assets and increases in accrued compensation and employee benefits  partially offset by the increase in accounts receivable and unbilled work in progress 
cash was used in investing activities primarily for additions to property and equipment and the purchase of interest bearing investments  partially offset by the maturities of interest bearing investments 
cash was used in financing activities for the payment of dividends  reduction of capital lease obligations and repurchase of company stock  partially offset by cash generated by the exercise of stock options 
in fiscal  cash provided by operations resulted primarily from net income before depreciation and amortization  and increases in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities and accrued compensation and employee benefits  partially offset by the increases in accounts receivable  other assets and unbilled work in progress 
cash was used in investing activities primarily for additions to property and equipment  and purchases of interest bearing investments  partially offset by the maturities of interest bearing investments 
cash was provided by financing activities primarily from the exercise of stock options  partially offset by cash used for the payment of dividends and the reduction of capital lease obligations 
future cash flows will continue to be affected by operating results  contractual billing terms and collections  investment decisions and dividend payments  if any 
at september   the company had no significant capital commitments other than those obligations described in notes  and of the consolidated financial statements 
on december   the company purchased undeveloped land in san rafael  california  with the intention of constructing an office complex to accommodate future growth 
development has commenced  and on may   the company entered into a synthetic lease arrangement  which will materially increase the company s future operating lease expenses 
rental payments will commence upon completion of construction  which is expected to occur in the second quarter of fiscal with this external financing  the company believes that the cash and marketable securities on hand  along with cash expected to be generated by operations  will be adequate to meet its capital and liquidity needs for both the current year and the foreseeable future 
year the company is performing year remediation work and compliance testing on its software products marketed to customers 
the updated versions of most of its software products currently being shipped to customers are year compliant 
certain international versions of the company s software products are not yet year compliant  but the company expects to be prepared to ship upgrade patches for these products by the end of calendar year remediation work  including compliance testing  for most earlier versions of the company s software installed at customer sites will be performed as part of the company s normal upgrade and maintenance process 
prior to the end of calendar  the company will discontinue support for some software products that have been replaced by other products  and year upgrades for these products will not be available 
revenues from such products are not significant 
there are no assurances that the company s current products do not contain undetected errors or defects associated with year date functions that may result in material costs to the company 
however  the company currently does not expect significant disruption of its revenues or operations from the year issues associated with its products 
the company has not made an assessment of the potential impact of failing to complete its own year remediation work nor has it developed any contingency plans for such an event 
additionally  the company has substantially completed its year inventory and assessment of internal information technology it and non it systems and applications and expects all major internal systems to be fully compliant by the end of december the company has determined that the majority of its internally developed systems are year compliant 
all applications supplied to company by third parties are either year compliant today or have patches currently available to bring them into compliance 
extensive compliance testing has commenced and will continue through most of the calendar year the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios would include a corruption of data contained in the company s internal information systems  and b hardware operating system failure 
the company is in the process of completing its contingency plans for business critical it and non it internal systems as an extension of its existing disaster recovery plan and expects to complete such planning by june  the company estimates that the costs of year remediation including compliance testing for its products and internal systems will be in the range of million to million 
approximately two thirds of these estimated costs have been expended as of september  these costs principally consist of both internal staff costs and expenses for external consultants  software and hardware  which have been or will be expensed by the company during the period they are incurred 
expected costs for the year remediation work including compliance testing and projected completion dates are based on the company s management s estimates and assumptions and actual results may vary materially from those anticipated 
the company has also initiated communications with third parties on which it is dependent for essential services and for the distribution of its significant services to determine how they are addressing year issues and to evaluate any impact on the company s operations 
the company is working with these third parties to resolve year issues and information received to date indicates that these parties are in the process of implementing and or testing remediation strategies to ensure year compliance of systems  services and or products 
however  the lack of resolution of year issues by these parties especially the credit bureaus and credit card processors through which the company distributes credit scoring and account management services could have a material adverse impact on the company s future business operations  financial condition and results of operations 
the company anticipates that the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios involving third party year issues would include a failure of infrastructure services provided by government agencies and third parties eg  transportation  electricity  telephone  internet services  etc 
and b failure of one or more of the credit bureaus or credit card processors through which the company distributes its credit scoring and account management services to achieve timely and successful year compliance 
contingency plans to address these most reasonably likely worst case scenarios are under development and are expected to be completed by june  at this time the company cannot quantify the potential impact of third party year issues 
the foregoing information and statements regarding the company s year capabilities and readiness are year information and readiness disclosures in conformance with the year information and readiness disclosure act of enacted on october  european economic and monetary union emu under the european union s plan for economic and monetary union emu  the euro becomes the sole accounting currency of emu countries on january  its initial phase goes into effect on january   in participating countries austria  belgium  finland  france  germany  ireland  italy  luxembourg  the netherlands  portugal and spain 
in this initial phase the emu mandates that key financial systems be able to triangulate conversion rates so that any amount booked will be logged and processed simultaneously in both the local currency and euros 
the company believes that its computer systems and programs are euro compliant 
costs associated with compliance were not material and were expensed by the company as they were incurred 
quarterly results the table in note to the consolidated financial statements presents unaudited quarterly operating results for the last eight fiscal quarters 
management believes that all the necessary adjustments have been included in the amounts stated to present fairly the selected quarterly information  when read in conjunction with the financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
this information includes all normal recurring adjustments that the company considers necessary for a fair presentation thereof  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
quarterly results may be affected by fluctuations in revenue associated with credit card solicitations  by the timing of orders for and deliveries of certain asap and triad systems and by the seasonality of scorenet purchases 
with the exception of the cost of scorenet data purchased by the company  most of its operating expenses are not affected by short term fluctuations in revenues  thus  short term fluctuations in revenues may have a significant impact on operating results 
however  in recent years these fluctuations were generally offset by the strong growth in revenues from services delivered through credit bureaus and third party bankcard processors 
management believes that neither the quarterly variations in net revenues and net income nor the results of operations for any particular quarter are necessarily indicative of results of operations for full fiscal years 
accordingly  management believes that the company s results should be evaluated on an annual basis 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures 
the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity security price risk 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
the company maintains a short term investment portfolio consisting mainly of income securities with an average maturity of less than one year 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at september   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
the company has the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore the company would not expect its operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on its securities portfolio 
the company believes foreign currency and equity risk is not material
