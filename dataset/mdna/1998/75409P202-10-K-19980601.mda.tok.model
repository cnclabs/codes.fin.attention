microsoft relationship on october   rational and microsoft announced the formation of a business alliance that consisted of rational s acquisition of microsoft s visual test product  technology cross licensing  joint development projects  and joint marketing programs 
the purchase price of the visual test product consisted of a single million cash payment 
rational s operating results for the quarter ended december   were reduced by a nonrecurring charge of million associated with the acquisition of the visual test product 
the charge to operations for acquired in process research and development represented the present value of the estimated cash flow expected to be generated by visual test related technology  which at the acquisition date had not yet reached the point of technological feasibility and did not have an alternative future use 
rational plans to continue devoting effort to developing commercially viable products from the acquired in process research and development

year compliance rational is aware of the problems associated with computer systems as the year approaches 
year problems are the result of common computer programming techniques that result in systems that do not function properly when manipulating dates later than december  the problem may affect transaction processing computer applications used by the company for accounting  distribution  and planning 
the problem may also affect embedded systems such as building security systems  machine controllers  and other equipment 
rational is in the process of assessing and upgrading systems which fail to be year compliant and will continue to review internal system requirements and correct further issues as they are identified 
based on recent assessment  the company does not anticipate incurring material costs to be year compliant 
however  there can be no assurance that actual costs will not substantially exceed the company s assessment due to internal year problems or year problems associated with the company s products 
further  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be converted in a timely manner  or that a failure to convert by another company  including without limitation any of the company s vendors  customers  or partners  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on the company
