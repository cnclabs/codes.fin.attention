cautionary statement for purposes of reform act the following contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the reform act 
actual results  performance or achievements of the company could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward looking statements 
the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update publicly these forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
results of operations overview the company s current business activity focus is the exploration and development if warranted of precious metal and diamond deposits within specific geological domains 
under canadian gaap  expenditures relating to these activities are capitalized in recognition of the potential future value of prospective targets 
upon completion of the exploration phase  a decision to proceed to the development phase requires that these expenditures reflect the cost of the resultant reserves and be depleted on the unit of production basis over the estimated total reserve to be mined 
a decision to discontinue exploration or not to proceed to the development stage for a specific project would result in reducing the capitalized total cost of the exploration program and charging those costs against income 
as such  reported net income or loss for the company may be volatile and principally represents investment revenues received through the investment of idle funds  the surplus received on redemption of preferred shares in ogml held by the company  and other revenues  as offset by those expenditures which cannot be directly attributed to a specific project and those costs for projects the company has elected to abandon 
under us gaap  exploration and general and administrative expenses related to projects are charged to expense as incurred  whereas under canadian gaap  such expenses are capitalized as discussed above 
property acquisition costs are deferred for both canadian and us gaap until it is determined whether a project is commercially feasible 
in addition  under us gaap  compensation expense is recorded for the excess of the quoted market price over the option price granted to employees and directors at the date of grant under stock option plans 
under canadian gaap  no compensation expense is recorded for such awards 
the gains on issuance of subsidiary s common stock recorded under canadian gaap in respect of the parc and guyanor equity financings would not be recorded under us gaap 
under us gaap  accrued severance and social charges resulting from the shut down of alluvial mining operations at sotrapmag would not have been recorded as of december   as the requirements for accrual were not satisfied 
the effect of the differences in accounting under canadian gaap and us gaap on the statement of net loss is as follows for the years ended december  in thousands except per share amounts net loss under canadian gaap    effect of the deferred exploration expenditures on loss for the period    effect of recording compensation expense under stock option plans reversal of the gain on subsidiary s issuance of common stock   reversal of accruals for severance costs   effect of omai preferred share redemption  net loss under us gaap before minority interest   minority interest   net loss under us gaap    basic and diluted net loss per share under us gaap compared to the company reported a net loss of million in as compared to a net loss of million in during  the company recorded property abandonment charges of million  including million and million  respectively  from the relinquishment of certain diamond and gold properties in guyana  million from the write off of certain diamond properties in suriname  million for the regina est property and million for other property areas in french guiana  million for portions of property areas in cote d ivoire  million for projects in mali  million for the galla valley project  million for certain gold properties in brazil and million related to various property interests in bolivia
