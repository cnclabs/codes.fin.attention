for a comparison of first virginia s performance ratios to those of its national and regional peer groups  please refer to the charts throughout the report 
the growth in income during was caused primarily by an increase in net interest income  which rose million in the year  following previous increases of million in and million in the net interest margin  which has equaled or exceeded every year since  rose basis points in to  following a six basis point rise in this level places first virginia in the top tier of banks and is one of the primary factors behind its consistently high profitability 
the corporation s extensive branch network  which offers convenience and a high degree of service for customers  serves as a relatively low cost source of core deposits 
despite the higher cost of maintaining a network of this size  the corporation s efficiency ratio consistently outperforms its peer group of banks  it was in compared to an industry average of 
total assets increased million in to billion after increasing million in and million in during  the corporation acquired premier bankshares corporation  a million bank holding company operating in southwest virginia 
this acquisition was accounted for as a purchase  and the results of operations and assets and liabilities for premier are included in first virginia s financial statements  beginning may  during  the corporation acquired two branches with million in deposits in the tri city area of tennessee 
there is a pending acquisition of seven branches with approximately million in deposits from the former signet bank that will take place february in connection with the acquisition of premier  the corporation issued  shares of stock and increased shareholders equity by million 
during the year  the corporation repurchased and retired  shares of common stock at a cost of million 
in addition to the three for two stock split  the cash dividend was increased twice during the year to an annualized rate of per share at the end of the year 
this marked the th consecutive year in which the dividend was increased at least twice during the year and the st consecutive year of dividend increases

most of this growth was a consequence of the premier bankshares acquisition as internal deposit growth was nominal 
interest rates were relatively stable throughout and  and the increased competition from mutual funds and the stock market  following a sustained four year rally in the market  put further pressure on growing deposits

statement of income net interest income the tables on pages through detail the increase in earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and demand deposits for the last three years  along with the related levels of fully taxable equivalent interest income and expense 
the variance in interest income and expense caused by differences in average balances and rates is shown on pages and interest rates were relatively stable in after declining modestly in and early by the end of  however  interest rates began dropping in response to a moderately expanding economy and inflation levels at year lows 
the decline in rates was exacerbated by financial turmoil in asia that resulted in a flight to quality as investors worldwide sought the strength and safety of us bonds 
as a consequence  the year us treasury security reached an historic low  and short term rates declined 
first virginia s net interest margin expanded basis points in to compared to in and in the primary reasons for the increase were an increase in the yield on earning assets and no change in the cost of funds 
in contrast  the increase in the net interest margin was caused by a more rapid decline in the cost of funds than in the decline in the yield on earning assets 
the net interest margin in both years was aided by a change in the mix of earning assets with relatively higher yielding loans replacing investment securities  thus improving the overall yield on earning assets 
because the corporation maintains a highly liquid position in its assets and liabilities  movements in interest rates do not have a material impact on the net interest margin 
as a result  the corporation has been able to maintain a net interest margin equal to or in excess of every year since  without needing to hedge its position with derivative securities 
net interest margin the higher  the better national first southern peer virginia regionals group southern regionals banking companies with assets over billion in national peer group banking companies with assets of between and billion in source keefe  bruyette woods in  the yield on earning assets rose basis points to compared to in while interest rates were fairly stable  the corporation increased the yield on its investment portfolio by nine basis points in as it replaced maturing lower yielding securities purchased in previous years with securities yielding higher rates 
similarly  maturing loans were replaced at higher yields  resulting in an increase in yield of four basis points to 
the corporation had originated a large number of relatively low interest rate home equity loans in  which largely matured in the mix of assets also changed during  with the relatively higher yielding loans comprising of earning assets compared to in and in the cost of funds was in both and despite generally lower interest rates in  competition for deposits increased to the extent that reductions in rates on deposits generally could not follow the decline in general interest rates levels 
interest rates on money market accounts were increased to stimulate demand in this relatively low cost deposit source and as a result  the average outstandings increased million in and million in  following a steady decline in previous years 
this increased the cost of these deposits by four basis points in  however  this was more than offset by declining costs of interest checking accounts  which generally followed the market s rate of decline  and in consumer certificates of deposit whose cost declined basis points to 
this decline in the cost of cds was also caused in part by a change in consumers preference to lower yielding  short term penalty free certificates that give the consumer the freedom to redeem the certificate early 
while this is a lower cost certificate for the corporation  it theoretically increases the exposure to changes in rates as the consumer may redeem the certificate at any time 
actual experience has shown  however  that relatively few of these certificates are redeemed prior to maturity  regardless of changes in interest rates 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses declined 
million in to million after increasing million in and million in the provision had increased steadily from  driven by an increase in outstanding loans and increases in net loan charge offs  which bottomed out in loan growth was primarily responsible for the increase in the provision in  however  in  loan growth slowed and declined slightly in the final two quarters of the year 
at the same time  net loan charge offs increased in and in after maintaining unusually low levels in the net charge off rate in was  a six basis point increase over  but still below the five year average just prior to the unusually low charge off rates of the allowance for loan losses declined two basis points to  the target level management estimates is appropriate based on the quality of the loan portfolio 
the allowance covers net charge offs times compared to times at the end of and covered nonperforming loans by compared to at the end of the corporation has a lower risk exposure to charge offs than many banks because the majority of its loans are made in small amounts to consumers and are generally well secured by assets such as an automobile or real estate 
these loans also have regular monthly repayment schedules and their average duration is substantially less than their stated lives 
credit card loans are made primarily to the banks customers located in the corporation s trade area and contain a lesser degree of risk and delinquency than many banks nationally solicited accounts 
the balance of the corporation s loans are made primarily to small and medium sized businesses in the corporation s trade area and are well secured 
approximately of the corporation s loans are for land development and construction and are primarily for residential or owner occupied facilities 
the corporation does not have any international  national or highly leveraged credits  nor does it have any concentration of credit in any one industry that exposes the loan portfolio to adverse risk 
while approximately of the corporation s loan portfolio is comprised of automobile sector loans  the loans are for relatively small amounts to consumers  have regular monthly payment schedules and are of the highest quality so that the risk of exposure is very limited 
the corporation has avoided the subprime segment of both the automobile and home equity loan markets 
noninterest income noninterest income  excluding security gains and losses  increased in to million  following a rise in to million 
first virginia derives approximately of its income from noninterest income and has traditionally been more dependent on net interest income than other banking companies its size 
the corporation s objective is to increase noninterest income at a more rapid pace than net interest income  and it has focused more attention on this area to reduce its historic dependence on net interest income 
income from trust services rose in  in and in  and the net profit margin in this area has nearly doubled in the past three years 
increased marketing  including the addition of sales compensated officers  new products and an emphasis on larger and more profitable accounts  has improved the sales and profitability of this area 
late in  the banks trust services were formally consolidated into one unit  trust and asset management services  thus streamlining its administration and unifying its marketing plans 
electronic banking service fees increased in and in income from this source includes automated teller machines atms  point of sale terminals and pc banking 
due to rule changes in early  which now permit banks to charge noncustomer fees for use of their atm machines  the income from this source has increased dramatically and has changed the economics of locating atms in nonbranch locations  now making such placements profitable 
as a consequence  the corporation implemented modest user fees for noncustomers using its atms in mid and has increased the number of machines in high traffic nonbranch locations such as convenience stores  shopping malls and other public facilities 
income from on line point of sale terminals increased in and in wary of the exposure to risk  the corporation does not offer a customer debit card for off line transactions 
income from insurance premiums and commissions declined slightly in both and this can be attributed to declines in credit life insurance sales  following state mandated decreases in premium rates and a slowdown in traditional installment loans at the branch level 
insurance commissions from the corporation s sale of life  health  and property and casualty insurance through its insurance agency rose in and in the corporation has increased its emphasis on the sale of insurance products and anticipates increased rates of growth in sales and profitability in this area over the next several years 
in  the corporation introduced an automobile leasing product through its network of automobile dealers 
income from this source more than doubled in but dropped in when declining used auto prices lowered the residual value for leases  making the product less attractive 
the corporation assumes no liability for these leases as they are originated for a fee for a third party who  in turn  assumes all credit  servicing and residual risk 
service charges on deposits increased in after rising in and in this income rose in and  primarily due to the acquisitions of premier bankshares corporation and farmers national bancorp 
it increased in because of increased commercial account fees 
the corporation continues to be successful in increasing the number of large national accounts with multiple locations to its servicing base 
credit card fees increased slightly in as increases in merchant sales volumes offset declines in the number of consumer accounts being charged an annual fee 
the corporation s policy is to hold all of its fixed income securities to maturity and  accordingly  there were no security sales producing gains or losses in  with the exception of some bonds called by the issuer prior to the maturity date 
at the end of  the corporation transferred million in securities to the available for sale portfolio  intending to sell these securities in to take advantage of certain tax carry forwards 
these securities were sold in early and produced a gain of million for the year 
other noninterest income in includes a million gain on the sale of a branch  which the us department of justice required the corporation to divest to satisfy concentration issues caused by the premier bankshares acquisition 
also included is a gain of million in both and and million in from the sale of mortgage servicing rights 
the corporation realizes a higher total profit in selling a package of servicing rights each year rather than selling individual loans with servicing released 
in  the corporation sold the bulk of its remaining mortgage servicing business in order to concentrate on more profitable mortgage origination activities 
noninterest income in also included gains of million on the sale of foreclosed real estate compared to more nominal amounts in both and noninterest expense first virginia s noninterest expense rose in to million compared to a increase in to million 
excluding the impact of the premier bankshares acquisition  expenses would have been up approximately in  roughly the rate of inflation 
the efficiency ratio improved slightly in to compared to in and in  remaining consistently better than the efficiency ratio for the corporation s national and regional peer groups 
efficiency ratio the lower  the better national first southern peer virginia regionals group southern regionals banking companies with assets over billion in national peer group banking companies with assets of between and billion in source keefe  bruyette woods salaries and employee benefits increased in to million 
excluding the expenses of the premier bankshares acquisition  employee benefits expense increased by approximately 
due to a increase in the corporation s stock price during the year  stock related compensation expense increased million after declining 
million in the previous year 
at the end of  all stock appreciation rights were redeemed  and performance criteria were not included in options granted in to reduce the level of this expense in the future 
the decline in pension plan benefit expense in was the result of an increase in the discount rate assumption of basis points to and of better than expected returns on plan assets 
a greater proportion of plan assets have been invested in common equities in recent years 
in  pension plan benefit related expense increased  caused primarily by a decline in the discount rate assumption of basis points to 
health care costs increased in  due in part to the inclusion of premier bankshares employees and to a modest increase in actual costs 
health care costs  which rose less than in  after a jump in  have been rising at a less rapid pace in the last two years due  in part  to a new corporate health care plan and to lower rates of increase in health care costs in general 
occupancy expense rose in  primarily as a result of the acquisition of premier bankshares and its branches 
it had increased in as a result of increases in rent expense for existing locations containing rent escalation contract clauses 
the increase in equipment expense in was primarily a result of updating the branch automation system to the most current generation of hardware and software  an improvement that also caused equipment expense to increase by 
the increase can also be attributed to the premier acquisition 
fdic expense declined to million in the expense of million included a one time assessment of million on deposits purchased in prior years from savings and loans in order to fully capitalize the savings association insurance fund saif 
full capitalization of the bank insurance fund bif in mid largely eliminated the fdic premium rate on banks in this caused a decline in fdic insurance expense in  following a drop in amortization of intangibles increased million with the purchase of premier in  which was accounted for as a purchase 
deposit intangibles and goodwill totaling million associated with this acquisition are being amortized over periods of to years 
intangible amortization increased million in as a result of the acquisition of two banks in accounted for as purchases 
other noninterest expense increased in due to the inclusion of premier bankshares in  to higher virginia bank franchise taxes caused by increased capital levels and to general increases in expenses 
in  the increase in other noninterest expense rose due to greater bank franchise taxes and a million increase in miscellaneous charge offs 
provision for income taxes income tax expense increased million in and million in  slightly greater than the increase in pretax income in both years 
a lesser portion of the corporation s interest income came from nontaxable municipal securities as income from this source continues to decline 
the corporation s effective tax rate increased 
to in  attributed to the nondeductibility of certain expenses for tax purposes  and by 
to in  caused by a decline in tax exempt municipal interest income 
balance sheet first virginia s lending portfolio is its primary earning asset  generating over of its gross income and funded mostly from the deposits of its customers  which are almost entirely core deposits 
most of its short term borrowings are related to the commercial account cash management activities and are functionally equivalent to deposits 
the corporation does not rely upon purchased deposits or nondeposit funding sources  nor does it sell or securitize its loan assets 
the corporation s objective is to invest of its total deposits and short term borrowings in loans 
in  the loan to funding liabilities rate was  an increase over the ratio in and the ratio in average loans increased in compared to  following a increase in most of this increase in was a result of the acquisition of premier bankshares accounted for as a purchase 
internal loan growth was approximately

other earning assets 




money market investments 
loans period end loans advanced in to billion  following a advance in to billion 
most of the increase can be attributed to the premier acquisition on may  the largest component of first virginia s loan portfolio is automobile related loans  particularly loans originated through automobile dealerships 
the corporation is a full service provider to the automobile dealership community and makes loans to consumers to finance their purchase of automobiles  loans to dealers to finance their inventory of automobiles and  to a lesser extent  their physical plant and facilities 
approximately of the corporation s loan portfolio is automobile related 
loans to consumers for automobiles expanded in and in gross production increased in and in one new loan production office was opened in  bringing the number of offices to six 
the corporation has been opening loan production offices throughout the southeast  and based on the success of this strategy to date  intends to continue expanding this activity in the future 
first virginia concentrates on the highest quality of automobile loans  primarily a and b credits 
most of these loans are made to consumers and are secured by new cars with a typical term of five years 
the loan portfolio s high quality means net charge offs are significantly below industry averages and servicing costs are low 
each loan in first virginia s portfolio is individually reviewed by an experienced loan underwriter  and credit scoring models are not used 
this allows the corporation to give highly personal service and quick approval to the dealer originating the loan 
the portfolio contains an almost equal distribution between domestic and foreign automobiles  with no concentration in any particular make of car 
the corporation also makes loans directly to dealers to finance their sales inventory floor plan loans  which are fully secured by specific automobiles 
average floor plan loans declined in and in the decline in was caused by dealers tightening their inventories as they reacted to a perceived slowdown in automobile sales  whereas the decline was a reaction to an excessive buildup in inventory in the prior year 
first virginia is committed to the automobile market  regardless of the economic cycle  and it devotes its primary lending resources to this area 
home equity loans increased in  following declines of in and in however  the increase in outstandings was a direct result of the premier bankshares acquisition  without which home equity loans would have continued their decline 
production of direct installment loans made in the corporation s branches  primarily home equity loans  declined in the decline in first mortgage rates and the ease with which they may be refinanced triggered this decline in home equity loan production 
home equity loans comprised of the loan portfolio at the end of  making them the second largest component of the portfolio 
as it does with automobile loans  first virginia pursues the highest quality home equity loans  with high underwriting standards that enable the corporation to show a nominal net charge off rate 
these loans are originated through the banks branches and through first general mortgage company  a home equity mortgage loan company that operates in areas outside the corporation s banking markets 
residential real estate loans increased at the end of  after advancing in  and comprise of the loan portfolio 
the corporation s consumer real estate portfolio is mostly composed of year fixed rate mortgages and longer term mortgages with interest rates that adjust every three to five years 
these types of loans are more stable  with rates that equal market rates of interest and without the same level of prepayment risk compared to long term fixed rate mortgages 
revolving credit loans  primarily credit cards  declined after increasing in and in growth slowed in and  a result of fewer new account direct mail solicitations  particularly in conjunction with the corporation s affinity programs 
at the end of negotiations were underway for the possible sale of approximately million in a large affinity program  or of total revolving credit loans 
it was not certain whether this transaction would actually occur or what price the corporation would receive 
first virginia promotes its card by offering one of the best low fixed rate  no annual fee card products in its market and generally has eschewed low teaser rates 
the corporation limits its solicitation efforts to the geographic area of its member banks 
these practices have resulted in a more stable cardholder base  an increased penetration rate in acquiring new accounts and accounts that have a much lower charge off rate than national averages 
commercial loans increased at the end of compared to a decline at the end of because premier bankshares had a greater percentage of its loan portfolio in this area  its acquisition caused this significant increase 
although loan activity was strong in the early part of  increased competition and loan balance paydowns caused it to weaken in the second half 
the corporation faced very aggressive competition both in interest rates and loan terms and noted that this typically marks the end of an economic cycle 
the corporation makes its loans to small and medium sized businesses in the communities served by its member banks  including loans to government contractors  high tech companies  hospitals  churches and country clubs 
these loans are typically in amounts between and million  generally with a maximum amount of million 
construction and land development loans increased at the end of to million following a increase in commercial property projects have increased significantly in and after several years of relatively little activity in this area 
occupancy rates for commercial properties have increased to the point where there are few large blocks of available space  and this has increased both build to suit and speculative building activity 
commercial real estate loans increased in  following a rise in loans to tax exempt and industrial development authorities increased in and in and are generally made for owner use properties  carrying primarily floating or adjustable interest rates 
loans december in thousands consumer automobile      home equity  fixed and variable rate      revolving credit loans  including credit cards      other      real estate construction and land development      commercial mortgage 
     residential mortgage 
     other  including industrial development authority loans      commercial      loans  net of unearned income      loans and other assets that are not performing in accordance with their original terms are discussed on pages to investment securities the average outstanding investment portfolio decreased to billion after increasing nominally in this decline in the investment portfolio was used to fund loan growth 
the corporation has constructed its portfolio in a laddered approach so an approximately equal amount matures each month 
this supplies liquidity to fund loan growth and provides for a natural hedge against changes in interest rates 
the corporation has classified its investment portfolio as held to maturity because it has both the ability and the intention to hold these securities to their stated maturity 
at the end of  approximately million in securities were reclassified out of the held to maturity category and into the available for sale category 
this was done for various tax purposes with the intention of selling the securities in consequently these securities were sold in the second quarter of and a million gain was realized 
the corporation places primary importance on safety and liquidity in its investment portfolio 
accordingly  the majority of the portfolio is invested in us government and agency securities with a maximum life of approximately five years 
at the end of and  the average life of the portfolio was months and months  respectively 
at december   us government and agency securities comprised of the securities portfolio 
this percentage has been gradually increasing since when changes in federal income tax laws reduced the tax benefits derived by banks for investments in municipal securities 
the limited availability of bank qualified municipal securities and the reduction in yield caused by the loss of tax benefits has generally made municipal securities less attractive to the corporation 
beginning in  the corporation has placed a higher portion of its portfolio in us government agency securities 
during  approximately of the investment portfolio was comprised of agency securities compared to at the end of  and the corporation intends to maintain them at approximately that level 
the majority of the securities were in callable securities with stated lives of approximately five years  although their actual lives are generally shorter 
these securities give the corporation a higher but more variable yield and a higher level of potential liquidity 
the corporation generally does not invest in mortgage backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations  structured notes or other types of derivative securities 
overnight investments overnight investments  consisting primarily of federal funds sold and securities repurchase agreements  are generally governed by anticipated deposit swings and loan demand 
in  average overnight investments increased to million  following a modest increase in deposits average deposits increased in and in the growth in was caused almost entirely by the inclusion of premier bankshares in the balances  internal growth was nominal 
despite declines in interest rates in general in the last half of  interest rates on deposits were virtually unchanged 
the increased competition for funds among banks and from nonbank intermediaries  such as mutual funds and the stock market  prevented any reduction in deposit interest rates 
as a result  the cost of funds for both and was unchanged at 
average deposits millions of dollars noninterest bearing    interest checking    savings    money market consumer cds    large denomination cds some migration continued out of consumer savings accounts  which declined in and in money market accounts increased and in and  respectively  and advanced strongly in the last six months of the year when the corporation increased the interest rate on accounts with balances over  average consumer certificates of deposit increased to billion in again as a result of the premier bankshares acquisition  internal growth in this category was slightly negative 
average large denomination certificates of deposits  primarily deposits of states  counties and municipalities in the corporation s market area  increased in to 
billion 
the corporation took a slightly more aggressive bidding stance for these deposits  which increased their average cost by basis points to 
the corporation does not purchase brokered deposits nor does it solicit deposits outside of its primary market areas 
average demand deposits increased  about half of which was attributed to the premier bankshares acquisition and half to internal growth  particularly in consumer accounts  driven by the corporation s extensive branch network 
average demand deposits increased in average interest checking deposits increased in after declining 
in the corporation has traditionally obtained a higher proportion of its deposits from low cost transaction accounts compared to its peers  and in  demand deposits and interest checking plans comprised of total average deposits  virtually unchanged from consumer savings and money market accounts comprised of average deposits compared to in maturity ranges for certificates of deposit with balances of  or more on december   are as follows in thousands one month or less  after one month through three months  after three through six months  after six through twelve months  over twelve months  other interest bearing liabilities short term borrowings consist primarily of commercial paper issued by the parent company and securities sold by the member banks with an agreement to repurchase them on the following business day 
these short term obligations are issued principally as a convenience to deposit customers in connection with cash management services 
average short term borrowings from these sources increased in and in long term debt is comprised of capitalized lease obligations on branch office facilities that are not subject to prepayment and one equipment note for the purchase of the corporation s mainframe computer 
shareholders equity first virginia has historically been one of the most highly capitalized banking companies in the nation  a reflection of its principles of safety  income and growth  in that order 
during  the ratio of average shareholders equity to average total assets increased basis points to 
this was significantly higher than the maintained by similar banks in the corporation s peer group of to billion asset sized banks 
the tier leverage ratio declined by basis points to caused by an increased level of intangible assets with the premier bankshares acquisition 
each of the corporation s individual banks maintains capital ratios well in excess of regulatory minimums  and all qualify as well capitalized banks  allowing them the lowest fdic premium rate and freedom to operate without restrictions from regulatory bodies 
the board of directors has approved several plans to repurchase the corporation s common stock since  and the corporation has cumulatively repurchased  shares and retired million in equity 
in  the board approved a program to purchase million shares  and the corporation purchased  shares of stock and retired million in equity under this program in there is a remaining balance of  shares that may be purchased under this current authorization 
in the course of its repurchase programs  the corporation has employed the use of equity put warrants and accelerated share repurchase contracts 
first virginia and its subsidiary banks are required to comply with capital adequacy standards established by the federal reserve and the fdic 
the corporation exceeded the regulatory risk based capital requirements by wide margins  due in part to the high level of capital and the conservative nature of the corporation s assets

each member bank s internal loan monitoring system also provides a detailed monthly report of production  delinquencies and nonperforming and potential problem loans 
this careful monitoring has resulted in a consistent record of low delinquencies and charge offs  as well as few nonperforming loans in relation to the entire loan portfolio 
the corporation has no foreign or highly leveraged transaction loans  and loans are only made within the trade areas of the member banks or in adjacent states where the corporation maintains loan production offices generating high quality consumer installment loans 
loans are generally not participated with nor purchased from banks outside of the first virginia system 
in addition  participations between banks within the first virginia system must first be shared with the corporation s lead bank  where a second comprehensive loan review process is performed 
approximately of the corporation s loans are made to consumers and are normally secured by personal or real property 
first virginia has no significant concentrations of credit to a single industry or borrower  and its loans are spread throughout its market area 
the corporation s legal lending limit to any one borrower is approximately million  however  it generally limits its loans to any one borrower and related interests to million 
in special cases  the corporation may exceed its internal guideline from time to time 
one of the corporation s specialty loan areas is the automobile finance area  and loans are made to consumers  both directly in the member bank branches and indirectly through automobile dealerships 
roughly of the total loan portfolio is comprised of consumer automobile loans but  because loan amounts are relatively small and spread across many individual borrowers  the risk of any major charge offs is minimized 
the corporation s automobile loans consist primarily of the highest quality loans  commonly referred to in the industry as a and b quality loans 
these loans contain substantially fewer risk characteristics than lower quality c and d subprime loans and have lower delinquencies  charge offs and collection costs 
during periods of economic weakness  subprime loan categories generate very high delinquencies and charge offs  while the high quality loans the corporation specializes in experience only modestly higher delinquencies and charge offs 
the corporation also makes loans directly to high quality automobile dealers to finance their inventories

there was no concentration of foreclosed real estate or nonaccruing loans in any specific geographic location or type of property  and the majority of nonperforming assets were comprised of smaller balance loans to consumers 
the table below shows the total of nonperforming assets at the end of each of the past five years 
experience has shown that actual losses on nonperforming assets are only a small percentage of such assets

of outstanding loans at the end of compared to million or 
of the loan portfolio at the end of loans past due days or more have increased steadily since reaching a low in and are primarily consumer loans secured by automobiles or home equity loans 
the increase in was primarily a result of the inclusion of delinquencies from premier bankshares in  which had a higher level of delinquencies than first virginia 
however  these levels of delinquencies are still significantly below industry averages and reflect the high overall quality of the corporation s loan portfolio 
as collections from the former premier banks are assumed by first virginia  these levels are expected to decline 
a loan generally is classified as nonaccrual when full collectibility of principal or interest is in doubt  when repossession  foreclosure or bankruptcy proceedings are initiated  or when other legal actions are taken 
in the case of installment loans  a loan is placed in nonaccrual if payments are delinquent days  and for other loans  after payments are delinquent for days 
credit card loans are charged off if they are days past due 
if collateral on a loan is sufficient to ensure full collection of principal and interest  an exception to the general policy might be made 
loans may also be placed in a nonaccruing status at any time prior to that indicated above if the corporation anticipates that interest or principal will not be collected 
potential problem loans consist of loans that are currently performing in accordance with contractual terms but for which management has concerns about the ability of an obligor to continue to comply with repayment terms because of potential obligor operating or financial difficulties 
at the end of  loans of this type that are not included in the table above of nonperforming and past due loans amounted to approximately million 
the majority of these loans represent commercial or property related loans 
depending on changes in the economy and other future events  these loans and others not presently identified as loans of this type could he reclassified as nonperforming loans in the future

management s methodology in determining the adequacy of the allowance considers specific credit reviews  past loan loss experience  current economic conditions and trends  and the growth and composition of the loan portfolio 
every commercial loan is reviewed and rated at least annually  and trends in the total portfolio are examined for potential deterioration in overall quality 
the corporation reduced the allowance steadily from the approximate level maintained at the time of the last recession to the current level of  as credit quality in the portfolio improved and net charge offs declined 
the allowance declined two basis points to a targeted level of in as a result of a decline in nonperforming assets and a belief that net charge offs have peaked

and an increase in loans past due days or more 
the allowance covered net charge offs times at the end of compared to times at the end of most of the corporation s loan portfolio consists of small  homogeneous loans to consumers with regular monthly repayment schedules  and accordingly  none of the allowance has been allocated to specific credits 
the corporation constantly monitors the allowance level  considering its long term experience and short term individual loan requirements 
the allowance is charged when management determines that the prospect of recovery of the loan s principal has significantly diminished 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance when collected 
if asset quality and loan charge offs remain at the current level  the corporation intends to maintain a loan loss allowance in the to range 
management believes this allowance is adequate to absorb any potential unidentified losses 
net charge offs declined to unsustainable low levels in and and have increased since then to near normal levels 
an increase in bankruptcies caused credit card loan net charge offs to increase in following increases of in and in to the current level 
they are still below national peer group statistics  however  and credit card loans comprise only of the total loan portfolio 
losses in the corporation s largest loan component  indirect auto loans  increased in and in  however  this represents a charge off rate of only

liquidity and sensitivity to interest rates the primary functions of asset liability management are to ensure adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities 
interest sensitive assets and liabilities are those that can be repriced to current market rates within a relatively short time period 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of the corporation s loan and deposit customers 
interest rate sensitivity management seeks to avoid fluctuating net interest margins and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
the corporation does not hedge its position with swaps  options or futures but instead maintains a highly liquid and short term position in substantially all of its earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
one of the primary ways the corporation meets its liquidity needs is by scheduling the maturity of its investment securities so that approximately an equal amount will mature each month 
the weighted average life of the securities portfolio at the end of was months  a slight increase from the approximately months at the end of because the corporation views its securities portfolio primarily as a source of liquidity and safety  it does not necessarily react to changes in the yield curve in an attempt to enhance its yield 
accordingly  the average life of the portfolio remains relatively stable as the corporation maintains a constant approach to its portfolio and invests primarily in us government and agency securities with a life generally no greater than five years 
municipal securities are also generally limited to lives of no more than five years  but availability and other factors mean they are occasionally purchased in serial issues with longer lives 
a cash reserve consisting primarily of overnight investments is also maintained by the parent company to meet any contingencies and to provide additional capital  if needed  to the member banks 
most of the corporation s loans are fixed rate installment loans to consumers and mortgage loans with maturities longer than the deposits by which they are funded 
a degree of interest rate risk is incurred if the interest rate on deposits should rise before the loans mature 
however  the substantial liquidity provided by the monthly repayments on these loans can be reinvested at higher rates that largely reduce the interest rate risk 
home equity lines of credit have adjustable rates that are tied to the prime rate 
many of the loans not in the installment or mortgage categories have maturities of less than one year or have floating rates that may be adjusted periodically to reflect current market rates 
these loans are summarized in the following table between year and after or less years years total in thousands maturity ranges commercial  financial and other     construction and land development 
    total     floating rate loans commercial  financial  agricultural and other    construction and land development 
   total    first virginia s asset liability committee is responsible for reviewing the corporation s liquidity requirements and maximizing the corporation s net interest income consistent with capital requirements  liquidity  interest rate and economic outlooks  competitive factors and customer needs 
liquidity requirements are reviewed in detail for each of the corporation s individual banks  however  overall asset liability management is performed on a consolidated basis to achieve a consistent and coordinated approach 
one of the tools the corporation uses to determine its interest rate risk is gap analysis 
gap analysis attempts to examine the volume of interest rate sensitive assets minus interest rate sensitive liabilities 
the difference between the two is the interest sensitivity gap  and it indicates how future changes in interest rates may affect net interest income 
regardless of whether interest rates are expected to increase or fall  the objective is to maintain a gap position that will minimize any changes in net interest income 
a negative gap exists when the corporation has more interest sensitive liabilities maturing within a certain time period than interest sensitive assets 
under this scenario  if interest rates were to increase it would tend to reduce net interest income 
at december   the corporation was liability sensitive in the short term under six months by approximately of earning assets  which declines to in months 
technically  the corporation may reprice interest checking  savings and insured money markets at any time and  accordingly  they have been classified in the day sensitivity category in the accompanying table 
while these accounts have in the last several years been somewhat more subject to repricing than in prior years  the degree and frequency of movement is limited  and they are much less sensitive than contractually possible

x x x first virginia also uses simulation analysis to monitor and manage interest rate sensitivity 
under this analysis  changes in interest rates and volumes are used to test the sensitivity of first virginia s net interest income 
simulation analysis uses a more detailed version of the information shown in the table above that includes adjustments for the expected timing and magnitude of changes in assets and liabilities 
these adjustments take into account that interest rates on individual asset and liability categories may change at a different relative pace from their contractual rate 
a large part of first virginia s loans and deposits come from its retail base  and they do not automatically reprice on a contractual basis in reaction to changes in interest rate levels 
while first virginia s liability sensitivity in the short term indicates that an increase in interest rates may negatively affect short term net interest income  management would likely take actions to minimize its exposure to negative results and within a relatively short period of time would make adjustments so that net interest income would not be materially impacted 
for example  despite wide changes in interest rates since  first virginia has maintained a net interest margin above every year and has been able to maintain adequate liquidity to provide for changes in loan and deposit demands 
using shock analysis of a hypothetical  immediate increase in all interest rates of basis points and comparing that to a stable interest rate environment over the next months also indicates that net interest income would decrease by  while an immediate hypothetical decrease in rates of basis points would increase net interest income by 
such an immediate change in all rates would be highly unlikely in management s opinion 
the corporation s dynamic simulation modeling takes into account the effects that such changes may have on overall economic activity  the reaction of individual categories of assets and liabilities  and the impact that different management actions may have on net interest income 
accordingly  first virginia has not experienced the earnings volatility its interest sensitive gap position or shock analysis may indicate 
over time  or under stable interest rate conditions  net interest income will tend to be greater at higher interest rate levels 
this is due to the large proportion of low cost core deposits such as demand  interest checking  savings and insured money market accounts comprising the corporation s funding sources  which can be invested in relatively higher yielding loans and investments 
year the year issue is the result of computer programs using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the corporation s computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
first virginia began preparing its computer systems and applications for the year in this process involves modifying or replacing the corporation s affected hardware and software as well as ensuring that external service providers  significant vendors and customers are taking the appropriate action to remedy their year issues 
management expects to have substantially all of the system and application changes completed by the end of and believes that its level of preparedness is appropriate 
first virginia estimates that the total cumulative cost of the project will be approximately million  which includes both internal and external personnel costs related to modifying the systems  as well as the cost of purchasing or leasing hardware or software 
purchased hardware and software will be capitalized in accordance with normal policy 
personnel and all other costs related to the project are being expensed as incurred 
these costs are not expected to have a material effect on the corporation s results of operations 
the costs of the project and the expected completion dates are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that could influence the results may include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties

quarterly results the results of operations for the first three quarters of have been analyzed in quarterly reports to shareholders 
the results of operations for each of the quarters during the two years ended december   are summarized in the table on pages and the results of operations for the fourth quarter are highlighted below 
net income for the fourth quarter of was million or 
per diluted common share as compared to the fourth quarter results of million or 
per share 
this decline in net income was primarily the result of a greater rate of increase in noninterest expenses of as compared to noninterest income  which declined 
the prior year s fourth quarter noninterest income included the gain on the sale of foreclosed property of million while the fourth quarter included only a nominal gain 
excluding the impact of this gain in  noninterest income increased  led by a gain in trust services income and a increase in service charge income on deposits 
noninterest expense increased to million compared to the prior year s fourth quarter  which did not include premier related expenses 
noninterest expense increased compared to the third quarter of  driven primarily by a million charge for stock related employee compensation as performance targets for the vesting of stock options were met 
excluding the expense of these noncash options  noninterest expense was flat compared to the third quarter  because the corporation completed the integration of premier in the fourth quarter and began receiving the benefit of reduced operating expenses for the combined organizations 
the fourth quarter of also included a special rebate of thousand of fdic expense related to certain saif thrift related deposits 
the net interest margin increased nine basis points to compared to the prior year s fourth quarter 
the yield on earning assets increased at a greater pace than the cost of funds because the yield in the loan portfolio rose nine basis points and a greater proportion of earning assets were invested in loans as compared to lower yielding categories 
relatively stable deposit rates meant the cost of funds rose at a lesser rate of seven basis points 
asset quality was virtually unchanged from the excellent third quarter levels 
nonperforming assets increased to million or 
of loans compared to or 
of loans in the third quarter  but were down slightly compared to the 
of loans at the end of the fourth quarter of net loan charge offs represented 
of average loans in the fourth quarter compared to 
in the third quarter and the 
recorded in the prior year s fourth quarter 
the provision for loans losses declined to million in the fourth quarter of compared to million in due to a slower rate of growth in outstanding loans in the quarter 
at the end of the quarter  the allowance for loan losses was  which was unchanged from the third quarter and down two basis points from the prior year s fourth quarter
