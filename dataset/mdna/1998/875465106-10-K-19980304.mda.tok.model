item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the consolidated statements of operations  including trends which might appear  are not necessarily indicative of future operations 
the discussion of the company s results of operations reported in the consolidated statements of operations compares the years ended december  and  as well as december  and certain comparisons between the periods are made on a percentage basis as well as on a weighted average gross leasable area gla basis  a technique which adjusts for certain increases or decreases in the number of centers and corresponding square feet related to the development  expansion or disposition of rental properties 
the computation of weighted average gla  however  does not adjust for fluctuations in occupancy since gla is not reduced when original occupied space subsequently becomes vacant

slightly lower promotional  real estate taxes  and insurance expenses per square foot incurred in the period compared to the period were offset by higher common area maintenance expenses per square foot due to additional customer service amenities  such as trolleys  customer service counters and security and as result of expanding the riverhead center which has a cost per foot higher than the portfolio average

average borrowings increased principally to finance the first quarter acquisition of five oaks factory stores see overview above and expansions to existing centers until the company was able to issue additional equity in october depreciation and amortization per weighted average gla increased from per square foot to per square foot 
the increase reflects the effect of accelerating the recognition of depreciation expense on certain tenant finishing allowances related to vacant space

per square foot  or  as a result of the dilutive effect of the increase in additional square footage associated with the expansions since tenant sales at centers in their first year of operation often do not reach the level on which percentage rentals are required the breakpoint 
the decrease is also a result of escalating breakpoints in certain leases renewing at existing centers without comparable increases in sales 
tenant sales per square foot for centers which were opened all of and increased to approximately per square foot

per weighted average gla during period as compared to the increase is due to higher average borrowings outstanding during the period associated with the growth in gla and due to a higher average interest rate under the senior unsecured notes issued in march when compared with the short term lines of credit previously utilized 
depreciation and amortization per weighted average gla increased from per square foot to per square foot primarily due to increases in tenant finishing allowances included in building and improvements which are depreciated over shorter lives and the accelerated depreciation of certain tenant finishing allowances related to tenants who vacated or terminated their lease prior to the expiration of the lease term 
the extraordinary item represents the write off of previously deferred financing costs of  in connection with the early retirement of debt with the proceeds from the senior unsecured notes issued in march liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was   and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increases for all three years were primarily due to the incremental operating income associated with acquired or developed centers

cash provided by used in financing activities of  and million in  and  respectively  and has fluctuated consistently with the capital needed to fund the current development and acquisition activity 
in  the significant increase was due to the equity offering million and additional debt to fund acquisitions and expansions 
management believes  based upon its discussions with present and prospective tenants  that many tenants  including prospective tenants new to the factory outlet business  desire to open a number of new factory outlet stores in the next several years  particularly where there are successful factory outlet centers in which such tenants do not have a significant presence or where there are few factory outlet centers 
during  the company acquired three centers totaling  square feet and completed  or has under construction to be completed by the end of the first quarter of  the expansion of five existing centers totaling  square feet 
see general overview 
commitments for construction of these projects which represent only those costs contractually required to be paid by the company amounted to  at december  the company also is in the process of developing plans for additional expansions and new centers for completion in and beyond 
currently  the company is in the preleasing stages for future centers at two potential sites located in concord  north carolina charlotte and romulus  michigan detroit and for further expansions of four existing centers 
however  there can be no assurance that any of these anticipated or planned developments or expansions will be started or completed as scheduled  or that any development or expansion will result in accretive funds from operations 
in addition  the company regularly evaluates acquisition proposals  engages from time to time in negotiations for acquisitions and may from time to time enter into letters of intent for the purchase of properties 
no assurance can be given that any of the prospective acquisitions that are being evaluated or which are subject to a letter of intent will be consummated  or if consummated  will result in accretive funds from operations 
management intends to continually have access to the capital resources necessary to expand and develop its business and  accordingly  may seek to obtain additional funds through equity offerings or debt financing 
during september and october  the company completed a public offering of  common shares at a price of per share  receiving net proceeds of approximately million 
the net proceeds were used to acquire  expand and develop factory outlet centers and for general corporate purposes 
on october  the operating partnership issued million of senior  unsecured notes  maturing october  the net proceeds were used to repay substantially all amounts outstanding under the company s existing lines of credit 
on november   the company and the operating partnership filed a new registration statement with the sec to provide  under shelf registration statements  for the issuance of up to million in additional equity securities and million in additional debt securities 
in anticipation of the offering of the senior  unsecured notes  the company entered into an interest rate protection agreement on october   which fixed the index on the year us treasury rate at for days on a notional amount of million 
the transaction settled on october   the trade date of the million offering  and  as a result of an increase in the us treasury rate  the company received  in proceeds 
such amount is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the life of the notes and will result in an overall effective interest rate on the notes of 
at december   the company had revolving lines of credit with a borrowing capacity of up to million  of which million was available for additional borrowings 
based on the million in variable rate debt outstanding at december   the company had an insignificant amount of exposure to interest rate risk at year end 
also  with additional unsecured borrowings during the year  the company has effectively unencumbered approximately of its real estate assets as of december  in february  the company amended two of its revolving lines to increase amounts available by million  bringing the total borrowing capacity under the lines to million 
based on existing credit facilities  ongoing negotiations with certain financial institutions and funds available under the shelf registration statements  management believes that the company has access to the necessary financing to fund the planned capital expenditures during the company anticipates that adequate cash will be available to fund its operating and administrative expenses  regular debt service obligations  and the payment of dividends in accordance with reit requirements in both the short and long term 
although the company receives most of its rental payments on a monthly basis  distributions are made quarterly 
amounts accumulated for distribution are invested in short term money market or other suitable instruments 
certain of the company s debt agreements limit the payment of dividends such that dividends will not exceed funds from operations ffo  as defined in the agreements  on an annual basis or of ffo on a cumulative basis from the date of the agreement 
new accounting pronouncements in  the company adopted the financial accounting standards board s  sfas no 
 earnings per share  effective for fiscal periods ending after december  the new standard simplifies the computation of earnings per share by replacing primary earnings per share with basic earnings per share 
basic earnings per share does not include the effect of any potentially dilutive securities  as under the previous accounting standard  and is computed by dividing reported income available to common shareholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period 
fully diluted earnings per share is now called diluted earnings per share and reflects the dilution of all potentially dilutive securities 
in adopting the standard  companies are required to restate all prior period earnings per share data 
the adoption of this standard by the company had no impact on the historical reported earnings per share amounts in and as the effect of potentially dilutive securities were immaterial 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas no 
requires public business enterprises to adopt its provisions for periods beginning after december   and to report certain information about operating segments in complete sets of financial statements of the enterprise and in condensed financial statements of interim periods issued to shareholders 
the company is evaluating the provisions of sfas no 
 but has not yet determined if additional disclosures will be required 
funds from operations management believes that to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the company  ffo should be considered in conjunction with net income as presented in the unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
ffo is presented because it is a widely accepted financial indicator used by certain investors and analysts to analyze and compare one equity real estate investment trust reit with another on the basis of operating performance 
ffo is generally defined as net income loss  computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  before extraordinary items and gains losses on sale of properties  plus depreciation and amortization uniquely significant to real estate 
the company cautions that the calculation of ffo may vary from entity to entity and as such the presentation of ffo by the company may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other reporting companies 
ffo does not represent net income or cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of operating performance or to cash from operations as a measure of liquidity 
ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash flows available to fund dividends to shareholders and other cash needs 
below is a calculation of funds from operations for the years ended december   and as well as actual cash flow and other data for those respective years in thousands funds from operations income before gain on sale of land  minority interest and extraordinary item    adjusted for depreciation and amortization uniquely significant to real estate    funds from operations before minority interest    cash flows provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    weighted average shares outstanding    assumes the partnership units of the operating partnership held by the minority interest  preferred shares of the company and stock and unit options are converted to common shares of the company 
economic conditions and outlook substantially all of the company s leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses for the escalation of base rent and clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rentals based on tenants gross sales above predetermined levels  which the company believes often are lower than traditional retail industry standards which generally increase as prices rise 
most of the leases require the tenant to pay their share of property operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and advertising and promotion  thereby reducing exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
approximately  square feet of space is up for renewal during and approximately  square feet will come up for renewal in in addition  as typical in the retail industry  certain tenants have closed  or will close  certain stores by terminating their lease prior to its natural expiration or as a result of filing for protection under bankruptcy laws 
also  management may grant  from time to time  a tenant s request for reduction in rent to remain in operation 
there can be no assurance that any tenant whose lease expires will renew such lease or that renewals or terminated leases will be released on economically favorable terms 
the company s portfolio is currently leased 
existing tenants sales have remained stable and renewals by existing tenants have remained strong 
in addition  the company has continued to attract and retain additional tenants 
the company s factory outlet centers typically include well known  national  brand name companies 
by maintaining a broad base of credit tenants and a geographically diverse portfolio of properties located across the united states  the company reduces its operating and leasing risks 
no one tenant including affiliates accounts for more than of the company s combined base and percentage rental revenues 
accordingly  management currently does not expect any material adverse impact on the company s results of operation and financial condition as a result of leases to be renewed or stores to be released 
the company has evaluated its computer systems and applications for potential software failures as a result of recognizing the year and beyond 
most of the systems are compliant with the year  or will be with normal upgrades currently available to the company 
therefore  the company believes the costs to bring the remaining systems and applications in compliance will be insignificant 
contingencies there are no recorded amounts resulting from environmental liabilities as there are no known material loss contingencies with respect thereto 
future claims for environmental liabilities are not measurable given the uncertainties surrounding whether there exists a basis for any such claims to be asserted and  if so  whether any claims will  in fact  be asserted 
furthermore  no condition is known to exist that would give rise to a material environmental liability for site restoration  post closure and monitoring commitments  or other costs that may be incurred upon the sale or disposal of a property 
management has no plans to abandon any of the properties and is unaware of any other material loss contingencies
