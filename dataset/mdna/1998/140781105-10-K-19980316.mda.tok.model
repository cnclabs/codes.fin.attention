item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general business conditions carbo ceramics inc manufactures and sells ceramic proppants for use in the hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells 
hydraulic fracturing is the most common technique used to stimulate production from hydrocarbon bearing formations 
the process involves pumping fluids into an oil or gas well at very high pressure in order to fracture the rock formation that contains the hydrocarbons 
as the fracture is created  the fluids are blended with granular materials  or proppants  which fill the fracture and prop it open after the pressure pumping ceases 
the proppant filled fracture creates a highly permeable channel that enables the oil or gas to flow more freely from the formation  thereby increasing production from the well 
ceramic proppants are premium products that are sold at higher prices than sand or resin coated sand  the two primary alternative proppants 
the principal advantage of ceramic proppants is that they are stronger than sand based proppants 
the higher strength of ceramic proppants results in higher production rates in deep wells where sand or resin coated sand may crush under high closure stress 
consequently  the company s business is influenced by the level of deep drilling activity generally defined as wells deeper than  feet 
ceramic proppants are also more uniform in size and shape than sand based proppants 
this uniformity can result in higher production rates than sand based proppants when used in wells that do not otherwise need ceramics for their higher strength 
as deep drilling  particularly in north america  is typically focused on the production of natural gas  the company s business is significantly impacted by the number of natural gas wells drilled in north america 
in markets outside north america  sales of the company s products are less dependent on natural gas markets but are influenced by the overall level of drilling activity 
furthermore  because the decision to use ceramic proppants is based on the present value economics of comparing the higher cost of ceramic proppants to the future value derived from increased production rates  the company s business is secondarily influenced by the price of natural gas and oil 
from through  the company s revenues grew at a compound annual rate of despite relatively modest growth in the total number of gas wells drilled 
in  the most active year for drilling activity in the last decade  the company s revenues increased by over from from through  the ceramic proppant industry has had productive capacity in excess of demand 
the competitive pressure brought on by this excess capacity made it difficult for the company to raise prices on its products 
however  the company continued to grow its revenues through the introduction of carboeconoprop r  a new product introduced in  aimed at increasing the use of ceramic proppants in the fracturing of medium depth wells  which had previously been fractured with sand based proppants 
carboeconoprop r has been widely accepted in the industry and has been the company s fastest growing product line over the past five years 
the company expects that carboeconoprop r will continue to be the fastest growing product line in the future and  as a result  gross profit margins will decline slightly 
in the latter half of  the industry began to operate near full capacity and product availability on certain product lines was limited 
in  demand for ceramic proppants continued to increase and availability of all products was limited 
in light of this fact  the company raised prices on its products by an average of effective in the first quarter this price increase was the first across the board price increase that the company had realized since future growth in the company s revenues and net income are dependent on the future demand for natural gas in north america and the demand for hydrocarbons worldwide 
management believes that the demand for natural gas will continue to increase due to the abundance  relatively low cost and environmental benefits of natural gas as a source of energy 
with this in mind  the company initiated construction of a new manufacturing facility in mcintyre  georgia in july the plant will cost approximately million to construct and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of initial capacity of the plant is expected to be million pounds per year  an increase of over current manufacturing capacity 
impact of year the company has developed a plan to modify its information technology to be ready for the year and has begun converting critical data processing systems 
the company currently expects the project to be substantially complete by early  to cost less than  and have no significant effect on operations 
revenues percent percent change change in thousands revenues    carbo ceramics inc s revenues of million established a new annual record for the company and were higher than revenues in while sales volume increased from  revenues grew at a faster pace due to an increase in the average selling price that was the result of a price increase of approximately which became effective in january domestic volumes increased from as strong demand for natural gas resulted in a increase in drilling activity 
export volumes increased as the company s products became more widely accepted in the international oil markets 
the fastest growing product during was carbolite r  which increased from the largest part of this increase was in export sales  to russia  australia and the north sea 
revenues were million for the year ended december   an increase of over revenues of million 
while sales volume increased from  revenues grew at a slower pace because of a shift in the product mix toward carboeconoprop r  the company s lowest price product  targeted at penetrating the market for sand and resin coated sand 
for the year ended  carboeconoprop r accounted for of the company s total sales volume  up from in in addition  revenue growth lagged volume growth due to lower pricing in europe and south texas  as the company protected its market share by matching lower prices established by its competitors 
gross profit percent percent change change in thousands gross profit    gross profit the company s cost of goods sold consists of manufacturing costs and packaging and transportation expenses associated with the delivery of the company s products to its customers 
variable manufacturing expenses include raw materials  labor  utilities and repair and maintenance supplies 
fixed manufacturing expenses include depreciation  property taxes on production facilities  insurance and factory overhead 
gross profit for increased million or from gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased from to due to the higher average selling price resulting from the price increase which became effective in january and lower manufacturing costs in the new iberia manufacturing facility 
the lower costs achieved in new iberia were primarily the result of improved efficiency due to increased production at the plant versus the previous year 
production volumes also increased at the eufaula manufacturing facility due to a mid year capacity expansion project but this was offset by higher raw material prices resulting from a consolidation of suppliers in the eufaula area 
gross profit for increased by million or from gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased from to due to lower average selling prices for the company s products and increases in raw materials and labor 
raw material costs at the new iberia facility increased due to an increase in demand for carbohsp tm which requires a higher grade and higher cost raw material to produce than carboprop r 
raw material costs at the eufaula facility increased due to the negotiation of a new supply contract that was necessitated by a consolidation of suppliers in the eufaula area 
depreciation included in cost of goods sold increased by  from due to the effect of the full year s depreciation on plant expansions completed during selling  general administrative expenses percent percent change change in thousands sg a    sg a as a of revenues selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  in over while sg a expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues  there was a substantial change in the composition of these expenses from to in connection with the initial public offering of the company s common stock in  the vesting of restricted stock previously granted to the company s president and chief executive officer was accelerated 
this resulted in non cash compensation expense of  in  where none was present in these reductions in were partially offset by new costs incurred in connection with regulatory filing costs  listing expenses and shareholder communication costs associated with being a publicly traded company 
other sg a components that increased were those that vary with sales volume or profitability including warehouse and shipping expenses  commissions expense and incentive compensation 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  in over while sg a expenses increased only slightly as a percentage of revenues  there was a substantial change in the composition of these expenses in prior to the initial public offering of the company s common stock  a consulting agreement with the company s chairman was terminated in april as a result  expenses recognized in connection with the consulting agreement decreased by  in as compared to in connection with the initial public offering  the vesting of restricted stock previously granted to the company s president and chief executive officer was accelerated 
this acceleration resulted in an incremental non cash compensation expense of  over other increases in sg a expenses in were variable expenses that increased due to higher sales volume 
these variable expenses include warehouse charges  incentive compensation and franchise taxes
