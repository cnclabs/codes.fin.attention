the company s products are sold through a direct sales force to acute care hospitals and integrated healthcare delivery networks ihdns and on an original equipment manufacturer oem basis to patient monitoring equipment manufacturers 
revenues from sales of networked monitoring systems sold by the company s direct sales force are recognized upon shipment 
the sales cycle for networked monitoring systems has typically been from nine to months 
the company has experienced seasonal variations in sales of its networked monitoring systems  with sales in the first quarter typically lower than the preceding fourth quarter s sales due to customer budget cycles and sales remaining relatively flat during the third quarter 
furthermore  a large percentage of a particular quarter s shipments of networked monitoring systems has historically been booked in the last weeks of the quarter 
revenues from sales of oem products are recognized upon shipment 
the selling cycle for oem products varies depending upon product mix and the extent to which the company develops customized operating software for a particular oem customer 
in addition  the company has experienced seasonal variations in sales of its departmental products  with sales in the first quarter typically lower than the preceding fourth quarter s sales and third quarter sales of oem products generally being lower than other quarters 
the company s products are generally shipped as orders are received and  accordingly  the company typically operates with limited backlog 
as a result  sales in any quarter are dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
to date the company has not capitalized software development expenses 
however  the development of new products or the enhancement of existing products may require capitalization of such expenses in the future

the primary source of cash from financing activities in was from the issuance of preferred and common stock which was partially offset by the repayment of long term debt 
at december   the company s principal sources of liquidity consisted of million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and million of available credit facilities 
in august  the company renewed a secured lending arrangement the agreement with silicon valley bank  providing for a million revolving line of credit bearing interest at the bank s prime rate 
the bank does not have security interest in any of the company s assets unless the company is borrowing under the line of credit and fails to comply with certain financial covenants

the company expects to spend approximately million for capital expenditures during the company believes that existing cash resources  cash flows from operations  if any  and line of credit facilities will be sufficient to fund the company s operations for at least the next twelve months 
year compliance 
in the next two years  many companies will face a potentially serious information systems computer problem because many software application and operational programs written in the past may not properly recognize calendar dates beginning in the year this problem could force computers to either shut down or provide incorrect data or information 
the company is presently in the process of examining its computer systems and contacting its software providers to determine whether the company s software applications are compliant with the year as of december   the company s enterprise resource planning system has been validated to be year compliant 
while it is difficult to quantify the anticipated cost involved  the company s best estimate of expenditures is between  to  for such upgrades since they were part of the software and hardware provides normal upgrades to the company 
while the company believes that its systems are fully year compliant  the company intends to continue to review its information systems for any possible problems as well as monitor its key customers and suppliers for any impact that the year may have on their information systems which could then impact the company 
although the company believes that its products are year compliant  customers may be affected by year requirement issues as they could expend significant resources to correct or patch other software systems for year compliance 
these expenditures may result in reduced capital equipment budgets for other products  such as products offered by the company  which could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  reporting comprehensive income  and no 
sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
these statements are effective for fiscal years commencing after december  while the company is required to comply with the provisions of these statements in fiscal  it has been determined that the effect that these new standards will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures is not material 
in october  the american institute of certified public accountants issued sop  software revenue recognition  which supercedes sop the provisions of sop are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company is reviewing the impact of the statement on its financial statements 
factors that may affect future operating results dependence on increased market acceptance of networked monitoring systems 
in  sales of the company s networked monitoring systems increased to million from million in in  sales of the company s networked monitoring systems decreased to million from million in although the company has experienced sequential revenue growth in  sales of the company s networked monitoring systems have not returned to sales levels and the company s operating results since have been affected by the lower sales levels 
if the company is not successful in marketing and selling its networked monitoring systems  the company s business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  although the company s networked monitoring products have been installed in almost hospitals  there is no assurance that the company s products will achieve the hospital penetration which the company anticipates 
fluctuations in quarterly results 
the company s quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the future as a result of a number of factors  including  but not limited to the size and timing of orders  the length of the sales cycle  the company s success in expanding its sales and marketing programs and the effects of changes in sales force alignment  the ability of the company s customers to obtain budget allocations for the purchase of the company s products  changes in pricing policies or price reductions by the company or its competitors  mix of sales between networked monitoring systems and oem products  the timing of new product announcements and introductions by the company or its competitors  deferrals of customer orders in anticipation of new products or product enhancements  the company s ability to develop  introduce and market new products and product enhancements  market acceptance of new products or product enhancements  the company s ability to control costs  the availability of components  costs associated with responding software bugs or errors  regulatory compliance and timing of regulatory clearances and general economic factors 
the company s products are generally shipped as orders are received and  accordingly  the company has historically operated with limited backlog 
as a result  sales in any quarter are dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter and are not predictable with any degree of certainty 
further  a large percentage of any quarter s shipments have historically been booked in the last weeks of the quarter 
in addition  a significant portion of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  and the amount and timing of increases in such expenses are based in large part on the company s expectations for future revenues 
if revenues are below expectations in any given quarter  the adverse effect may be magnified by the company s inability to maintain gross margins and to decrease spending to compensate for the revenue shortfall 
further  the company has sometimes experienced seasonal variations in operating results  with sales in the first quarter being lower than in the preceding fourth quarter s sales due to customer budget cycles and sales remaining relatively flat during the third quarter 
lengthy sales cycle 
the decision by a healthcare provider to replace or substantially upgrade its clinical information systems typically involves a major commitment of capital and an extended review and approval process  and this review and approval process is becoming more complex  more financially oriented and increasingly subject to overall integration into the hospital s information systems planning 
the sales cycle for the company s networked monitoring systems has typically been nine to months from initial contact to receipt of a purchase order 
during this period  the company expends substantial time  effort and funds preparing a contract proposal and negotiating a purchase order without any guarantee that the company will complete the transaction 
any significant or ongoing failure to reach definitive agreements with customers has in the past and may in the future have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
competition 
the company s networked monitoring systems compete with systems offered by a number of competitors  including hewlett packard company  spacelabs  inc and marquette electronics  inc  most of which have significantly greater financial  technical  research and development and marketing resources than the company 
in addition  many of these competitors have longstanding relationships with acute care hospitals and ihdns 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sell to such hospitals or ihdns or that the company will be able to compete successfully with such vendors  and any inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s opennet applications may face significant competition in the future from hcis providers  patient monitoring companies  life support device companies and general purpose data network providers 
such potential competitors may elect to enter this market and compete with the company using significantly greater financial  technical  research and development and marketing resources than are available to the company 
in addition  the company s success in selling its multi parameter opennet networks to hospitals and ihdns will depend to a large extent on its ability to interface with patient monitoring and life support devices of other vendors 
any action on the part of such other vendors to make such interfacing more difficult or impossible could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the market for the company s oem products is also intensely competitive 
the company sells to a range of patient monitoring and life support device companies  many of which have significantly greater financial  technical  research and development and marketing resources than the company 
there can be no assurance that current oem customers will not elect to design and manufacture patient monitoring and system components currently supplied by the company or elect to contract with other oem suppliers 
any such election by one or more of such companies could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the company may in the future elect to incorporate in its oem products the hardware and software for larger networks and real time redistribution of information to remote viewing stations for use in specialty departments of hospitals for which the company s oem customers design and sell their products 
in the event the company incorporates these or other features into its oem products  the company believes that its oem customers would not compete with its networked monitoring systems because the networked monitoring systems are sold to hospitals and ihdns who elect to install larger  more dispersed systems 
however  the company could face competition with its oem customers to the extent hospitals forego purchasing the company s facility wide networked monitoring systems for the smaller departmental systems of its oem customers 
customer concentration  dependence on departmental products 
the company s oem product sales  which represented approximately and of the company s total net revenues in and  respectively  have historically been to a small number of oem customers 
in  quinton instrument company quinton and datascope corporation datascope accounted for approximately and  respectively  of the company s total revenues and in quinton and datascope accounted for approximately and  respectively  of the company s total revenues 
the loss of  or a reduction in sales to  any such oem customer would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
technological change  need to develop new products 
many aspects of the medical equipment industry are undergoing rapid technological change  changing customer needs  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards 
historically  the company derived substantially all of its revenue from sales of its networked monitoring systems and oem products 
the company believes that as the market for these products matures  vitalcom s future success will depend upon its ability to develop and introduce on a timely basis new products and product enhancements that keep pace with technological developments and that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of acute care hospitals and ihdns 
in addition  the introduction of competing products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render the company s existing products unmarketable or obsolete 
if the company is unable to develop and introduce product enhancements and new products in a timely and cost effective manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  or if the company s new products or product enhancements  such as sitelink  do not achieve market acceptance  the company s business  operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
uncertainty and consolidation in healthcare industry 
the healthcare industry is subject to changing political  economic and regulatory influences that may affect the procurement practices and operation of healthcare providers 
many healthcare providers are consolidating to create larger hospitals and ihdns 
this consolidation reduces the number of potential customers for the company s products  and the increased bargaining power of these organizations could lead to reductions in the amounts paid for the company s products 
these larger hospitals and ihdns may concentrate their purchases on a small number of preferred vendors with whom they have had longstanding relationships 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sell to such hospitals or ihdns or that the company will be able to compete successfully with such vendors 
the impact of these developments in the healthcare industry is difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
limited intellectual property protection 
the company relies on a combination of copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect its intellectual property 
the company seeks to protect its software  circuitry documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection 
the company cannot assure that its protective measures for proprietary rights will be adequate or that the company s competitors will not independently develop similar or superior technology  duplicate the company s products or otherwise circumvent its intellectual property rights 
although the company has never received a claim that its products infringe a third party s intellectual property rights  there can be no assurance that third parties will not in the future claim infringement by the company with respect to current or future products or proprietary rights 
any such claims  regardless of their merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  delay or prevent product shipments or require the company to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements 
the impact of any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
risk of product liability claims 
certain of the company s products provide applications that relate to patient physiologic status or other clinically critical information 
any failure by the company s products to provide accurate and timely information could result in product liability and warranty claims against the company by its customers or their patients 
the company maintains insurance against claims associated with the use of its products  but there can be no assurance that its insurance coverage would adequately cover any claim asserted against the company 
a successful claim brought against the company in excess of its insurance coverage or outside the scope of the company s insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
even unsuccessful claims could result in the expenditure of funds in litigation and diversion of management time and resources 
year compliance 
in the next two years  many companies will face a potentially serious information systems computer problem because many software application and operational programs written in the past may not properly recognize calendar dates beginning in the year this problem could force computers to either shut down or provide incorrect data or information 
the company is presently in the process of examining its computer systems and contacting its software providers to determine whether the company s software applications are compliant with the year as of december   the company s enterprise resource planning system has been validated to be year compliant 
while it is difficult to quantify the anticipated cost involved  the company s best estimate of expenditures is between  to  for such upgrades since they were part of the software and hardware provides normal upgrades to the company 
while the company believes that its systems are fully year compliant  the company intends to continue to review its information systems for any possible problems as well as monitor its key customers and suppliers for any impact that the year may have on their information systems which could then impact the company 
although the company believes that its products are year compliant  customers may be affected by year requirement issues as they could expend significant resources to correct or patch other software systems for year compliance 
these expenditures may result in reduced capital equipment budgets for other products  such as products offered by the company  which could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
dependence on sole source components 
certain of the company s products utilize components that are available in the short term only from a single or a limited number of sources  have been available only on an allocation basis in the past and could be in scarce supply again in the future 
any inability to obtain components in the amounts needed on a timely basis or at commercially reasonable prices could result in delays in product introductions  interruption in product shipments or increases in product costs  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition until alternative sources could be developed or design and manufacturing changes could be completed 
risks associated with recent management changes 
during  the company had a number of changes in its management team 
effective january   david l 
schlotterbeck stepped down as the company s chief executive officer  and donald j 
judson  the company s chairman of the board  assumed such responsibilities 
in march  the company hired a new vice president  direct sales and in july hired a new vice president  research and development 
in october  the company hired frank t 
sample as its new president and chief executive officer  with mr 
judson stepping down as such 
the addition of new senior management has involved increased salary levels which the company anticipates will result in increased administrative expenses in future periods 
such management changes can also involve disruptions in the company s day to day operations  can interrupt continuity in customers relationships and create delays in sales the cycles or product release schedules 
although the company believes that its new senior management will be successful in improving the company s business  operating results and financial condition  there can be no assurance that such changes will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition in future periods 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s success depends to a large extent on its ability to attract and retain key personnel 
the loss of the services  either temporarily or permanently  of any of the members of senior management or other key employees  particularly in sales and marketing and research and development  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the company s future success depends to a large extent on its ability to attract and retain additional key management  sales and marketing and research and development personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
government regulation 
the manufacture and sale of medical devices  including the company s products  is subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities 
in the united states  the company s products are regulated as medical devices and are subject to the fda s pre clearance or approval requirements 
the company has received clearance from the fda to market its current products through the k premarket notification process 
there can be no assurance that a similar k clearance for any future product or enhancement of an existing product will be granted or that the process will not be lengthy 
if the company cannot establish that a product is substantially equivalent to certain legally marketed devices  or if fda regulatory changes currently under consideration with respect to arrhythmia software are adopted  the k clearance procedure will be unavailable and company will be required to utilize the longer and more expensive premarket approval pma process 
failure to receive or delays in receipt of fda clearances or approvals  including the need for extensive clinical trials or additional data as a prerequisite to clearance or approval  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
sales of medical devices and components outside of the united states are subject to international regulatory requirements that vary from country to country 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain further clearance or approvals for its products or components on a timely basis or at all  and delays in receipt of  loss of or failure to receive such approvals or clearances could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s radio frequency transmitter devices are subject to regulation by the federal communication commission fcc  and applicable approvals must be obtained before shipment of such products 
the company believes that all of its products designated for sale in the united states meet applicable federal communications commission fcc regulations  including us fcc part for electromagnetic emissions 
the fcc approval process starts with the collection of test data that demonstrates that a product meets the requirements stated in part of the fcc regulations 
this data is then included as part of a report and application that is submitted to the fcc requesting approval 
the fcc may grant or request additional information or withhold approval 
any failure of the company s products to conform to governmental regulations or any delay or failure to obtain required fcc approvals in the future  if any  could cause the delay or loss of sales of the company s products and therefore have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and result of operations 
the company s proprietary radio frequency rf communication products transmit real time physiologic information from the patient to the central surveillance station 
these communication products currently operate in three radio bands vhf mhz to mhz  shared with tv channels  uhf mhz to mhz  shared with land mobile users  and the mhz radio band mhz to mhz licensed for spread spectrum operation 
the majority of the company s rf products use the vacant television frequencies in the vhf band 
the fcc is requiring all television stations to implement digital broadcasting transmission for high definition television hdtv 
major metropolitan areas will be required to implement hdtv by december  and other markets by december  in order to implement hdtv the fcc has granted each tv channel an additional mhz channel for digital broadcasting until the transition period ends  at which time the broadcaster would return one of the two channels 
as tv stations use the additional mhz channel for the digital broadcasting transition  which may take years  they may overlap into the radio spectrum which has been used for medical rf applications 
customers of the company s lower power rf communication products may begin seeing more interference in the future 
this interference may result in the company s hospital biomedical personnel having to re tune the company s rf transmitters to other channels in order to reduce interference 
in the event of high interference the company s customers may need to purchase equipment to transmit in the uhf frequency range 
the fcc also announced that they will be expanding the usable uhf frequencies for medical rf from the licensed mhz to mhz band to the unlicensed mhz to mhz frequency range 
with vhf frequency ranges available for medical rf use potentially becoming more limited and the uhf frequency ranges expanding  the company s competitors who have historically focused their rf products in what was the more limited uhf band  may now have a competitive advantage as compared to the company  until such time as the company expands its uhf rf product offerings 
any such competitive advantage of the company s competitors and any additional development costs associated with expanding the company s uhf rf product offerings could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
additionally  future regulatory changes could significantly affect the company s operations by diverting the company s development efforts  making current products obsolete or increasing the opportunity for additional competition which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition
