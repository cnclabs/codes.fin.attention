such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of the partnership to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause the partnership s financial condition  results of operation  liquidity and capital resources to differ materially include the boston celtics competitive success  uncertainties as to increases in players salaries  the boston celtics ability to attract and retain talented players  uncertainties relating to labor relations involving players and the lockout  the risk of injuries to key players and uncertainties regarding media contracts 
collective bargaining agreement as more fully described in item business and properties collective bargaining agreement  in march the board of governors of the nba voted to reopen the collective bargaining agreement and  effective july   the nba commenced a lockout of nba players in support of its attempt to reach a new collective bargaining agreement 
the nba and the nbpa have been engaged in negotiations regarding a new collective bargaining agreement  but as of september   no agreement has been reached 
in the event that the lockout extends into the season  nba teams  including the boston celtics  will refund amounts paid by season ticket holders plus interest for any games that are canceled as a result of the lockout 
in addition  as a result of the lockout  nba teams have not made any payments due to players with respect to the season 
the nbpa has disputed the nba s position on this matter  and both the nba and the nbpa have presented their cases to an independent arbitrator  who will make his ruling no later than the middle of october as of september   the arbitrator has not ruled on this matter 
there can be no assurance that the nba and the nbpa will reach agreement on a new collective bargaining agreement  and there can be no assurance that nba teams  including the boston celtics  will not have to make payments to players under contract for the season and beyond during the lockout 
given the fixed nature of many of its expenses  and given that the partnership s operating revenues are almost entirely dependent on the nba season  any loss of games as a result of the absence of a collective bargaining agreement or the continuation of the lockout will have a material adverse effect on the partnership s financial condition and its results of operations 
further  if nba teams  including the boston celtics  are required to honor the player contracts for the season and beyond without agreeing to a new collective bargaining agreement or without ending the lockout  which would result in the loss of games  the partnership s financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
further  in the event that the nba and the nbpa agree to a new collective bargaining agreement or the lockout ends  there can be no assurance that the nba and nbpa will not experience labor relations difficulties in the future or significantly increased player salaries  which could have a material adverse effect on the partnership s financial condition or results of operations
