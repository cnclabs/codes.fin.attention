results of operations fiscal years and revenues 
electronic clearing house  inc recorded a net income of  for the fiscal year ended september   compared to a net income of  for the fiscal year ended september   an increase of 
this is indicative of the revenue growth in fiscal combined with an improvement in gross margin in bankcard processing and transaction revenue from in fiscal to in fiscal the improvement in gross margin was mainly due to the implementation of certain industry specific fees in fiscal which had virtually no impact on direct costs 
total revenues increased by  from  for fiscal to  for fiscal the increase reflected revenue growth of in bankcard processing and transaction revenue which is partially offset by a decrease in terminal sales and lease revenue from prior fiscal year 
the increase in processing and transaction revenue is attributable to three areas the increase in processing volume from the company s growing merchant base along with the overall rate increases for the entire merchant base as a result of the interchange rate increases implemented by visa and mastercard in april  the increase in inventory transaction volume with u haul international  and the implementation of certain industry specific fees in the current fiscal year 
revenue related to terminal sales is recognized when the equipment is shipped 
terminal sales and lease revenue decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  a decrease 
this decrease in revenue reflected a  decrease in terminal sales to merchants which is offset by the delivery of approximately  systems to u haul international in the current fiscal year versus  u haul systems and systems to the united states postal service usps under a pilot program awarded to the company in the prior fiscal year 
the company provided software and hardware to the usps for the development and deployment of automated money order dispensing systems under a pilot program awarded to computer based controls inc cbc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the usps extended the pilot program in january to add additional features into the overall systems 
cbc designed and implemented the requested features and a successful first article test of the new features was completed by the usps in late june of completion of this phase of the pilot program was deemed successful by the usps in july additional features are being incorporated to further reduce paperwork and increase the speed of service  two primary goals of the usps 
to meet this need  the usps has now authorized a follow on project to the original pilot program 
additionally  the usps has requested the integration of the terminal provided by the company to operate with specific printers the usps uses in its higher volume locations 
the company believes that this request is an indication that its terminal is under consideration for a broader use in the usps environment in the higher volume offices  but no assurance of such use can be given at this time 
other revenues such as check guarantee fees and research and development revenue remained relatively constant 
there was a slight decrease in other revenue from  in fiscal to  in fiscal costs and expenses 
bankcard processing expenses have generally remained constant as a percentage of processing revenue 
a majority of the company s bankcard processing expenses are fixed as a percentage of each transaction amount  with the remaining costs being based on a fixed rate applied to the transactions processed 
bankcard processing and transaction expense increased in the current fiscal year over the prior fiscal year 
this was in direct relation to the increase in processing and transaction revenues 
cost of terminals sold and leased decreased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year this relates directly to the decrease in terminal and lease sales for the current fiscal year 
other operating costs included customer service expenses  check guarantee expenses  and research and development expenses 
overall  other operating costs decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  consistent with the slight decrease in other revenue 
selling and general and administrative expenses increased from  in the current fiscal year to  in fiscal  a increase 
this was due to the increase in total revenue and also attributable to the higher employee related costs in support of the company s infrastructure and growth 
liquidity and capital resources as of september   the company had available cash of  and restricted cash of  in reserve with its primary processing banks 
the company s working capital improved from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the company s cash flows generated from operations increased significantly in fiscal it increased from a negative cash flow of  in fiscal to a positive cash flow of  an increase of  the current level of cash flow from operations is sufficient to support the required research and development costs and marketing costs 
the positive cash flow from operations also allows the company to further develop its suite of internet products and services which is essential to the company s future growth 
the company s current ratio improved from to at september  to to at september  the company s debt to equity ratio remained virtually unchanged  from 
to at september  to 
to at september  other year issue many existing computer systems and related software applications  and other control devices  use only two digits to identify a year in a date field  without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century 
such systems  applications and or devices could fail or create erroneous results unless corrected so that they can process data related to the year the company relies on computer systems  applications and devices in operating and monitoring all major aspects of its business  including  but not limited to  its financial systems  customer services  internal networks and telecommunication equipment  and end products 
the company also relies  directly and indirectly  on the external systems of various independent business enterprises  such as its customers  sponsoring banks  suppliers  creditors  financial organizations  and of governments for the accurate exchange of data and related information 
in fiscal  the company received independent certification of year compliance from visa and from mastercard for processing authorization requests 
all possible paths for such transactions were demonstrated to be compliant 
in fiscal  the company assessed the year issues in depth and developed a comprehensive plan 
the company is currently executing its plan to minimize the potential impact of the year issues on its business and expects to be in a testing mode in the first calendar quarter of the company spent approximately  in fiscal year in connection with the year problems 
management s current estimate is that the costs associated with the year issue will be approximately  in fiscal the assignment of resources to address the year issue has had a minor impact on development and or delay of other company projects 
the company s existing contingency plan for business resumption during and following catastrophic events has been augmented to provide for longer term outages that could result from year issues 
for example  the uninterruptible power supply system that has served the company since has been replaced with a much more robust system 
in addition  a stand alone power generator has been installed to increase the company s ability to sustain longer term outages 
however  despite the company s efforts to address the year impact on its internal systems  the company may have failed to fully identify all areas and  once discovered  the company may not be able to resolve such areas without disruption of its business and without incurring significant expenses 
in addition  even if the internal systems of the company are not materially affected by the year issue  the company could be affected adversely as a result of any disruption in the operation of the various third party enterprises with which the company interacts 
significant care is being taken to confirm other key providers vendors are fully compliant with year issues but no assurance can be given that the company s efforts in this regard or that the representations made regarding compliance with year by vendors will prove successful

additionally  stand alone emod units were delivered to the usps in april and a phased deployment began in the dallas  texas area in may the company was informed in january that the pilot program was being extended and that the usps found that the emod system generated significant savings in time and money for the usps 
this was deemed to be due to the lower cost of money order issuance  management relating thereto  and the system s ability to electronically transfer daily accounting information to regional headquarters  lowering administrative and accounting costs accordingly 
the usps subsequently asked the cbc to bid the costs of making a software change to the emod that allowed other printers to be utilized with the eb control terminal and cbc submitted such bid in june final permission to proceed was received from the usps in december  and delivery of the modified software is expected to occur in the second quarter of fiscal it is anticipated that the software will be tested for a period of two to three months after delivery at which time the usps is expected to make a decision on promoting the emod program on a national scale 
no assurance can be given that the emod system will perform adequately to justify such national distribution or that the software will perform the requested tasks or that the estimate of units that might be required would actually be ordered under such circumstances
