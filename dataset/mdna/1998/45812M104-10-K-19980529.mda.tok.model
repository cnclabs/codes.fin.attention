total revenue increased by from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year and by to million in fiscal year the percentage of the company s total revenue attributable to the licensing and sale of software products product revenue increased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year this increase was due to a higher rate of growth for product revenue than for services revenue in fiscal year the percentage of total revenue attributable to product revenue decreased in fiscal year to  primarily due to an increase in engineering and consulting services revenue at the integrated systems design center 
product revenue increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  and an additional to million in fiscal year the increase in product revenue from fiscal year to fiscal year was due primarily to an increase in the number of licenses of the company s psosystem and sniff products 
in addition  fiscal year product revenue includes revenues from the licensing of the product of epilogue from the date of its acquisition in july revenue from licenses of the company s matrixx product was essentially flat from fiscal year to fiscal year the increase in product revenue from fiscal year to fiscal year was due primarily to the licensing of prism  which was released in the second quarter of fiscal year  an increase in the number of licenses of sniff  and the inclusion of revenues from diab data and epilogue for the full fiscal year 
these increases were partially offset by a slight decrease in revenue from the licensing of matrixx 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations services revenue increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year and by to million in fiscal year these increases are due to growth in the company s base of installed software and the associated increase in maintenance and support revenue  and from growth in consulting and engineering services 
the increase in the rate of services revenue growth in fiscal year as compared to the fiscal year growth rate  was due to an increase in consulting activities and contracts at the integrated systems design center 
price increases were not a material factor in the company s revenue growth in the periods presented 
the percentage of the company s total revenue from customers located internationally was  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the increases in international revenue as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal years and were due primarily to product revenue in japan and europe growing faster than product revenue in the united states 
these increases were partially offset by the increase in service revenue at the integrated systems design center  which has a predominately domestic customer base 
in europe and japan  revenues and expenses are primarily denominated in local currencies 
in fiscal years and  the us dollar strengthened against many foreign currencies  which resulted in relatively lower revenues when translated into us dollars 
in fiscal year  revenue was less influenced by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
the company s operating and pricing strategies take into account changes in exchange rates over time  however  the company s results of operations may be significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  in recent months the currencies of many countries in the asia pacific region have lost significant value against the dollar 
as a result  revenue in this region could be adversely affected in fiscal year more generally  recent instability in the asian currency and stock markets could adversely affect the economic health of the entire region and could affect customer purchasing patterns 
costs and expenses

the company s cost of services revenue as a percentage of services revenue was  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
cost of services revenue as a percentage of services revenue can fluctuate due to shifts in the services revenue mix between higher margin maintenance and support revenues and lower margin engineering and consulting contracts revenues 
in addition  the cost of services revenue as a percentage of services revenue can fluctuate due to shifts in the proportion of fixed price versus time and material engineering and consulting contracts 
fixed price engineering and consulting contracts generally have lower gross margins than time and material contracts 
in fiscal year  cost of services revenue as a percentage of services revenue increased significantly compared to fiscal years and this was due to a higher percentage of total services revenues being derived from engineering and consulting contracts as opposed to maintenance and support contracts 
in addition  in fiscal year there was a higher proportion of fixed price engineering and consulting services contracts than in fiscal years and in particular  in the second quarter of fiscal year the company was required to procure a significant amount of hardware  which had no associated gross margin  under the terms of a large fixed price engineering services contract 
marketing and sales expenses increased by from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  and by to million in fiscal year marketing and sales expenses represented  and of total revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the increase in marketing and sales expenses in fiscal year  in both dollars and as a percentage of total revenue  was due to the company s aggressive expansion of its domestic and international sales and support infrastructure

research and development expenses increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year and by from fiscal year to million in fiscal year research and development expenses in fiscal years  and  were  and  respectively  of total revenue 
the dollar increases in research and development expenses were attributable primarily to increased personnel and consulting costs associated with the company s continued emphasis on developing new products and enhancing existing products  including prism and matrixx version  which were released in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal year  respectively 
the rate of increase in research and development expenses was significantly higher between fiscal years and than between fiscal years and  due primarily to the effort associated with the development and release of the company s prism product 
the company believes that significant investment for product research and development is essential to product and technical leadership 
the company anticipates that it will continue to devote substantial resources to product research and development throughout fiscal year costs that are required to be capitalized under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed were  in fiscal year   in fiscal year and  in fiscal year the amount capitalized represents approximately of total research and development expenditures for fiscal year compared to for fiscal year and for fiscal year the amount of research and development expenditures capitalized in a given time period depends upon the nature of the development performed and  accordingly  amounts capitalized may vary from period to period 
capitalized costs are being amortized using the greater of the amount computed using the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product  or on a straight line basis over three years 
amortization for fiscal year was  compared to  for fiscal year and  for fiscal year general and administrative expenses increased and in fiscal years and  respectively  and represented  and of total revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively
