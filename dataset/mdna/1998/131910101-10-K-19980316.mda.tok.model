item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is engaged in the research  development and commercialization of products for the non invasive diagnosis of cardiac disease 
the company has experienced substantial net losses since its inception in and expects net losses to continue for the foreseeable future 
the company believes that its research and development expenses will continue to increase in the future as it develops additional products and funds clinical trials of its products 
the company s research and development expenses may also increase in the future as it supplements its internal research and development with third party technology licenses and potential product acquisitions 
the company also expects that its selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in connection with the company s continued expansion of its sales and marketing activities 
revenues generated from the sale of the company s products will depend upon numerous factors  including the timing of regulatory actions  the effectiveness of its distribution strategies  competition and the availability of third party insurer reimbursement for t wave alternans testing 
the company has incurred cumulative net losses since inception through december  of approximately  results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal revenues were  in the fiscal year ended december  fiscal and  for the fiscal year ended december  fiscal  an increase of  or 
sales of the company s ch system and accessories accounted for of total revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal the remainder of the current year s revenues were from the sale of the company s proprietary  disposable high resolution electrodes 
revenues from products sold to the company s independent distributors outside the united states were  in fiscal  an increase of   over fiscal year sales to international distributors accounted for of the company s total revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal sales to united states customers were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  an increase of 
the increase in us revenues reflects the impact of the expansion of the number of trained sales representatives during fiscal the company now employs five direct sales representatives in the us compared to two at the end of fiscal in addition  the company has over independent manufacturers sales representatives under contract at the end of fiscal compared to at the end of fiscal it is the company s intention to continue to increase the number of independent manufacturers representatives included in its us distribution organization during cost of goods sold was  of product sales  in fiscal and  of product sales  in fiscal the improved ratio of costs to product sales during fiscal primarily reflects the impact of increased volumes on the allocation of fixed manufacturing overheads 
the company anticipates that this factor in addition to the impact of programs targeted at reducing the cost of direct materials will continue to favorably effect the overall gross margins 
research and development costs were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  an increase of  or 
this increase reflects the expansion in the company s clinical trial activities to support the filing of a k with the fda in for expanded product labeling claims for its t wave alternans technology 
the company intends to continue to increase its funding in support of third party clinical trials to further the adoption of t wave alternans testing and in house research in support of its t wave alternans and cei technologies 
fiscal results include a charge of  to recognize current year costs associated with non qualified stock options issued under the equity incentive plan to scientific advisors 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the increase is primarily the result of the costs associated with the expansion of the company s us field sales organization during fiscal and increases in the cost of marketing efforts targeted at the rapid adoption of t wave alternans testing by clinical cardiologists and other medical professionals 
additionally  during fiscal  the company experienced several changes in management personnel 
as a result  the company recorded  of termination costs associated with these changes 
interest income for fiscal was  compared to  for fiscal the increase reflects a full year of interest earned on the investment of the remaining proceeds associated with the company s initial public offering of common stock in august fiscal compared to fiscal the company had  of revenues in the fiscal year ended december  fiscal and  in fiscal year the fiscal revenues reflect the first full year of international product sales and the receipt of clearance from the fda to sell the company s products in the united states 
fiscal revenues were limited to the sale of initial ch systems as demonstration units to international independent distributors 
during fiscal  approximately of total revenues were to international independent distributors 
cost of goods sold was  or of product sales in fiscal and  or in fiscal the ratios of cost to product sales during both fiscal and fiscal reflect the fixed overhead costs incurred by the company as it established manufacturing operations to support commercialization of its initial product sales 
research and development expenses were  in fiscal and  in fiscal  an increase of 
the company continued to selectively increase its staffing during fiscal  as well as the amount of funding in support of clinical trials 
at the end of fiscal  the company employed people in its research and development organization 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  in fiscal and  in fiscal during fiscal  the company initiated its efforts to establish a distribution organization in support of us sales goals 
additionally  the company selectively expanded its administrative support infrastructure as us distribution and manufacturing operations were begun 
interest income was  in fiscal and  in fiscal this increase reflects the interest earned on the investment of proceeds from the company s initial public offering of its common stock in august inflation and income taxes inflation did not have a significant effect on the company s results of operations for any of the three years in the period ended december  the company has not recorded a provision for income taxes for the years   and because it incurred net losses in each of such years 
at december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards of  as well as  and  of federal and state tax credit carryforwards  respectively  available to offset future taxable income and income tax liabilities  respectively 
these carryforwards generally expire in the years through and may be subject to annual limitations as a result of changes in the company s ownership 
there can be no assurance that changes in ownership in future periods or continuing losses will not significantly limit the company s use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the company has generated taxable losses from operations since inception and  accordingly  has no taxable income available to offset the carryback of net operating losses 
in addition  although management s operating plans anticipate taxable income in future periods  such plans provide for taxable losses over the near term and make significant assumptions which cannot be reasonably assured including approval of the company s products by the fda and market acceptance of these products by customers 
based upon the weight of all available evidence  the company has provided a full valuation allowance  at december  for its deferred tax assets since  in the opinion of management  realization of these future benefits is not sufficiently assured defined as a likelihood of slightly more than fifty percent 
liquidity and capital resources the company initially financed operations primarily from the sale of convertible preferred stock 
through june   the company had raised  net of stock issuance costs from the sales of equity securities 
on august   the company raised approximately  net of stock issuance costs from the sale of  shares of common stock in the company s initial public offering

cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased by  from december  to december   consistent with the company s net loss for fiscal accounts receivable  net  increased by  during the year  reflecting increased sales activity and the broadening of the company s customer base 
although write offs to date have not been material  the expansion of the customer base to include additional distributors and individual health care institutions has also led to the establishment of a reserve for doubtful accounts at december  inventory levels have increased from  to  during the year  primarily reflecting increasing levels of commercial production 
fixed asset additions during the year primarily represent increased sales demonstration and clinical research units as the company has expanded activities in both of these areas 
the company expects its capital expenditures to increase as it continues to commercialize its products  particularly in connection with the manufacture of its proprietary hi res electrodes 
the company does not expect capital expenditures to exceed an aggregate of  over the next two years

minimum license maintenance fees under these license agreements  which are creditable against royalties otherwise payable for each year  range from  to  per year in total through the company is committed to pay an aggregate of  of such minimum license maintenance fees subsequent to december  as part of these agreements  the company is also committed to meet certain development and sales milestones  including a requirement to spend a minimum of  in any two year period for research and development  clinical trials  marketing  sales and or manufacturing of products related to certain technology covered by the consulting and technology agreements 
the company anticipates that its existing capital resources  including the amounts raised in the initial public offering  will be adequate to satisfy its capital requirements until at least the middle of thereafter  the company may require additional funds to support its operating requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity financing or from other sources

factors which may affect future results this annual report on form k the annual report contains forward looking statements 
for this purpose  any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  intends and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements 
these factors include  without limitation  those set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report 
the company is engaged primarily in the commercialization  manufacture  research and development of its products for the non invasive diagnosis of cardiac disease 
the company has incurred substantial and increasing net losses through december  there can be no assurance that the company will ever generate substantial revenues or achieve profitability 
the company believes that its future success substantially depends upon successful commercialization and market acceptance of its t wave alternans technology 
the analysis of t wave alternans to diagnose ventricular arrhythmia is a new diagnostic approach that is currently investigational 
the company anticipates that it will submit k application for clearance from the fda for a labeling claim covering the applicability or prognostic use of its t wave alternans technology during there can be no assurance as to when or if the fda will approve the company s submission 
market acceptance will depend upon the company s ability to obtain regulatory clearance or approval for claims covering the applicability or prognostic use of t wave alternans measurement  as well as its ability to demonstrate the diagnostic advantages and cost effectiveness of the technology 
there can be no assurance that regulatory approval for such claims will ever be received or that the company will be able to successfully commercialize or achieve market acceptance of the t wave alternans technology or that the company s competitors will not develop competing technologies that are superior to those of the company 
the company has sponsored and is continuing to sponsor clinical studies relating to its t wave alternans technology and hi res electrodes to establish the prognostic value of such technology 
while these studies on high risk patients to date have indicated that t wave alternans is associated with ventricular arrhythmia to a degree comparable to ep testing  there can be no assurances that the results of such studies will continue to do so 
any results of clinical studies or trials which fail to demonstrate that t wave alternans is comparable in accuracy to alternative diagnostic tests  or which otherwise call into question the cost effectiveness  efficacy or safety of this  or other company technologies  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s products  product development activities  manufacturing processes and sales and marketing are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries 
in the united states  the fda regulates the introduction of medical devices as well as manufacturing  labeling and record keeping procedures for such products 
in order for the company to market its products for clinical use in the united states  the company must obtain from the fda clearance of a k pre market notification 
marketing clearance or approval for new medical devices from the fda can be costly and time consuming  and there can be no assurance that such clearance or approval will be granted for the company s future products on a timely basis  if at all  or that fda review will not involve delays that will adversely affect the company s ability to commercialize additional product or expand permitted uses of existing products 
a significant portion of the company s revenue is dependent upon sales of its products outside the united states 
foreign regulatory bodies have established varying regulations  duties and tax requirements 
specifically  the european union has promulgated rules which require that medical products receive the right to affix the ce mark  an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with applicable european medical device directives 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to obtain ec approval for its future products 
the inability or failure of the company or its international distributors to comply with varying foreign regulations or the imposition of new regulations could restrict or  in certain countries  result in the prohibition of the sale of the company s products internationally and thereby adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the medical device market is characterized by intense competition and rapidly advancing technology 
the future success of the company will depend  in large part  upon its ability to anticipate and keep pace with advancing technology and competitive innovations 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in identifying  developing and marketing new products or enhancing its existing products 
in addition  there can be no assurance that new products or alternative diagnostic techniques will not be developed that will render the company s current or planned products obsolete or inferior 
rapid technological development by competitors may result in the company s products becoming obsolete before the company recovers a significant portion of the research  development and commercialization expenses incurred with respect to such products 
competition from competitors medical devices that help to diagnose cardiac disease is intense and likely to increase 
the company competes with manufacturers of ecg stress tests  the conventional method of diagnosing ischemic heart disease  and may compete with manufacturers of other non invasive tests  including ecg s  holter monitors  ultrasound tests and systems of measuring cardiac late potentials 
many of the company s competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater capital resources  name recognition  research and development experience and regulatory  manufacturing and marketing capabilities 
many of these competitors offer well established  broad product lines and ancillary services not offered by the company 
some of the company s competitors have long term or preferential supply arrangements with physicians and hospitals which may act as a barrier to market entry 
the company currently markets its products in the united states through a small direct sales force and independent manufacturers representatives 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to recruit and retain skilled sales management  direct sales persons or independent manufacturers representatives 
the company markets its products internationally through independent distributors 
these distributors may also distribute competing products under certain circumstances 
the loss of a significant international distributor could have a material adverse effect on the company s business if a new distributor  sales representative or other suitable sales organization cannot be found on a timely basis in the relevant geographic market 
to the extent that the company relies on sales in certain territories through distributors  any revenues the company receives in those territories will depend upon the efforts of its distributors 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that a distributor will market the company s products successfully or that the terms of its distribution arrangements will be acceptable to the company
