seasonality and other factors there are certain seasonal factors that may affect the company s business 
traditionally  manufacturing businesses in italy close for the month of august  and the company s hosiery customers close for one week in july 
consequently  no shipments or deliveries  as the case may be  of machines distributed by the company that are manufactured in italy are made during these periods which fall in the company s first quarter 
in addition  manufacturing businesses in italy generally close for two weeks in december  during the company s second quarter 
fluctuations of customer orders or other factors may result in quarterly variations in net revenues from year to year 
effects of inflation and changing prices management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on the company s operations 
disclosure about foreign currency risk generally  the company s purchases of foreign manufactured machinery for resale are denominated in italian lira 
in the ordinary course of business  the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements between the italian lira and the us dollar from the time of placing the company s purchase order until final payment for the purchase is made 
the contracts have maturity dates that do not generally exceed months 
substantially all of the increase or decrease of the lira denominated purchase price is offset by the gains and losses of the foreign exchange contract 
the unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are deferred and recognized in the results of operations in the period in which the hedged transaction is consummated 
a substantial portion of the company s textile machine and spare part purchases are denominated and payable in italian lira 
currency fluctuations of the lira could result in substantial price level changes and therefore impede or promote import export sales and substantially impact profits 
however  to reduce exposure to adverse foreign currency fluctuations during the period from customer orders to payment for goods sold  the company enters into forward exchange contracts 
the company is not able to assess the quantitative effect that such currency fluctuations could have upon the company s operations 
there can be no assurance that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will not have a significant adverse effect on future operations 
at june   the company had contracts maturing through march to purchase approximately billion lira for approximately million  which approximates the spot rate on that date 
note regarding private securities litigation reform act statements made by the company which are not historical facts are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward looking statements 
all such forward looking statements are subject to the safe harbor created by the private securities litigation reform act of important factors that could cause financial performance to differ materially from past results and from those expressed and implied in this document include  without limitation  the risks of acquisition of businesses including limited knowledge of the businesses acquired and misrepresentations by sellers availability of financing  competition  management s ability to manage growth  loss of customers  and a variety of other factors 
year compliance the company has reviewed its computer and business systems to identify those areas that could be adversely affected by year software failures 
the primary information system used by both speizman industries and tmc has been reviewed and all known issues related to the year issues have been resolved 
costs incurred were not significant 
the primary information system used by wink davis is not year compliant 
in conjunction with the purchase of wink davis on august   management planned to integrate wink davis information into the existing system used by speizman industries 
the integration project  which was not accelerated due to the year issue  is scheduled to be completed in december the estimated project cost of integrating wink davis information system is approximately  a substantial portion of the equipment distributed by the company has computerized controls and features 
however  to the company s knowledge  no operating features of the equipment are dependent on any time or date information  such as the year issue 
the company is aware of one subsidiary s voice mail system and there may be other computer based systems which may require upgrading to ensure operational continuity beyond december  the company has substantially completed identification of all such systems and believes that all significant systems will be compliant in time to ensure no disruption to the company s operations 
the cost of bringing these minor systems into compliance is not anticipated to be material 
currently  the company cannot predict the effect of the year problem on entities with which it transacts business and there can be no assurance it will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the company will be formulating a contingency plan to address the possible effects of any of its customers experiencing year problems
