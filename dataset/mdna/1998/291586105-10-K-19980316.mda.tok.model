forward looking statements certain statements made in this management s discussion and analysis  which are summarized here  are forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties  and actual results may be materially different 
factors that could cause actual results to differ include  but are not limited to those identified the expectations that in the future electrotherapy sales will remain flat at best and iontophoresis and orthotic products sales will increase  depend on retaining reimbursement by medicare carriers  workers compensation programs  managed care and private insurance payors 
increased sales of incontinence products also depend on the company s ability to obtain medicare reimbursement approval for the company s pelvic floor stimulation products 
in addition  other general market conditions and competitive factors within the rehabilitation market  including the introduction of new products or technology by competitors  could adversely effect sales 
the expectation of a slight decrease in the gross profit percentage depends on the actual product mix  prices from suppliers  other market conditions and actual manufacturing and distribution efficiencies 
the expectation that the company will increase marketing expenditures related to recently launched products depends on market acceptance and the necessary support for such products 
the company s intention to continue its stock repurchase program in depends on the market conditions and the company s cash position 
the sufficiency of the company s cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  together with cash flow from operations  depends on general market conditions and competitive conditions 
the company s products are regulated under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  and the company is required to secure clearance from the us food and drug administration fda prior to marketing new products 
lack of clearance or delays in securing clearance could negatively impact sales of new products 
if the company is not successful in meeting the needs of patients  providers and payors in the orthopedic rehabilitation and incontinence treatment markets  its financial goals will likely not be met
