item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview capitol transamerica corporation the company is an insurance holding company operating in states which writes  through its subsidiaries  both property casualty and fidelity surety insurance 
the property casualty segment accounts for approximately of the business written while the fidelity surety segement accounts for approximately of the company s business 
the underwriting cycles of the property casualty insurance industry have been characterized by peak periods of adequate rates  underwriting profits and lower combined ratios  while the downward side of the cycle is characterized by in adequate rates  underwriting losses and  as a result  higher combined ratios 
the adequacy of premium rates is affected primarily by the severity and frequen cy of claims which in turn are affected by natural disasters  regulatory measures and court decisions which continue to uphold the deep pocket theory in awarding against insurance companies 
unfortunately for the insurance indus try  the trend of increasing price competition has continued as has the number of significant natural disasters 
this combination has resulted in a consider able reduction in underwriting profitability for the industry as a whole 
inflation also has a significant impact on the insurance industry in general  as well as on the company 
inflation creates higher claim costs  which are then matched currently against premiums whose rating statistics were developed from data of previous years 
in recent inflationary periods  this has led to inade quate rate structures  since rate regulators are slow to grant rate adjustments at times when the overall economy is in an inflationary cycle 
studies have shown that premium rates trail the claim experience by a period of two years or more 
adequate premium rates continue to be of concern to the company and the property casualty insurance industry 
operating results as mentioned in the overview  the property casualty insurance industry is in a downward cycle 
however  despite a difficult year in which the company aggessively strengthened its reserves  mangement expects that trend of in creasing revenues and significant underwriting gains will continue in the future 
the expansion of coverages and entry into new geographic regions has contributed to increased revenues  which when combined with prudent under writing standards should enable the company to resume its upward trend in profitability for our shareholders 
indeed  when the industry s cycle re verses  the company will be in an excellent position to take advantage of premium rate increases 
gross premiums written during were  compared with  in and  in premiums earned are recognized as net revenues after reduction for reinsurance ceded and after establishment of the provision for the pro rata unearned portion of premiums written 
net premiums earned in totaled  compared with  and  in and  respectively 
the net unearn ed premium reserve was   and  at each year end 
gross premiums written    reinsurance ceded    net premiums written    net premiums earned    net unearned premium reserve    the large increase in ceded premiums in is due to a new reinsurance agreement entered into during the year 
cic assumes and fully cedes dental capitation premiums while retaining a brokerage fee 
the company should not incur any net losses from this business 
the company s underwriting results can be measured by reference to the combined loss and expense ratios 
this tabulation includes the operating results of the two subsidiary insurance companies on a statutory basis 
losses and loss adjustment expenses are stated as a ratio of net premiums earned  while underwriting expenses are state as a ratio of net premiums written 
the combined ratios were as follows insurance operating ratios statutory basis losses and loss adjustment expenses underwriting expenses combined ratios in the company strengthened ibnr reserves by million  which increased the loss ratio by 
despite this large adjustment  the company s combined loss and expense ratio was still slightly below the projected industry average for of  and well below the industry average of for the year reinsurance the company follows the customary practice of reinsuring with other companies  eg  ceding a portion of its exposure on the policies it has written 
this pro gram of reinsurance permits the company greater diversification of business and the ability to write larger policies while limiting the extent of its maximum net loss 
it provides protection for the company against unusually serious occurrences in which a number of claims could produce a large aggregate loss 
management continually monitors the company s reinsurance program to obtain pro tection that should be adequate to ensure the availability of funds for losses while maintaining future growth 
net investment income and realized gains the company s fixed maturities and equity securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value 
the unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  are reported as a separate component of shareholders investment 
interest and dividend income interest on fixed maturities is recorded as in come when earned and is adjusted for any amortization of purchase premium or discount 
dividends on equity securities are recorded as income on ex dividend dates 
investments invested assets    net investment income    percent of return to average carrying value realized gains    change in unrealized gains    the net increase in unrealized gains of  for was comprised of a  decrease in fixed maturities and an increase of  in equity securities 
net investment income in amounted to  compared with  and  in and  respectively 
unrealized gains were   and  at each respective year end 
income taxes income tax expense is based on income reported for financial statement purposes and tax laws and rates in effect for the years presented 
deferred federal in come taxes arise from timing differences between the recognition of income de termined for financial reporting purposes and income tax purposes 
such timing differences are related principally to the deferral of policy acquisition costs  the recognition of unearned premiums  and discounting the claims reserves for tax purposes 
deferred taxes are also provided on unrealized gains and losses 
loss reserves reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses reflect the company s best estimate of the liability for the ultimate cost of reported claims and incurred but not reported ibnr claims as of the end of each period 
the estimates are based on past claim experience and consider current claim trends as well as social and economic conditions 
the company s reserves for losses and loss ad justment expenses were  at december  compared with  at december  this increase is a combination of giving con sideration for the increase in premium volume  increased retention on all lines of coverages written and an increase in the ibnr reserves 
management continues to closely monitor the reserve development trends and projections as it attempts to stabilize the loss reserve development which has occurred in recent years 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity refers to the company s ability to meet obligations as they become due 
the obligations and cash outflow of the company include claim settlements  acquisition and administrative expenses  investment purchases and dividends to shareholders 
in addition to satisfying obligations and cash outflow through premium collections  there is cash inflow obtained from interest and dividend income  maturities and sales of investments 
because cash inflow from premiums is received in advance of cash outflow required to settle claims  the company accumulates funds which it invests pending liquidity requirements 
therefore  investments represent the majority in  in and in of the company s assets 
cash outflow can be unpredictable for two reasons first  a large portion of liabilities representing loss reserves have uncertainty regarding settlement dates  and second  there is potential for losses occurring either individually or in the aggregate 
as a result  the com pany maintains adequate short term investment programs necessary to ensure the availability of funds 
the investment program is structured so that a forced sale liquidation of fixed maturities should not be necessary during the course of ordinary business involvement and activities 
the company has no material capital expenditure commitments 
year a significant issue facing not only the insurance industry but society as a whole is potential problems related to the approaching year older computer programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  those computer programs may misinterpret a date  using as the year rather than year during and the company incurred approximately million of ex penses in updating its mangement information system to alleviate potential year problems 
this process is substantially completed  with only testing and peripheral adjustments remaining 
the additional expense for the testing and adjustments is expected to be approximately  as a re sult of these efforts  the company is confident that the year will not cause a significant disruption to its business 
the company has also assessed the potential impact of year related problems that may be encountered by our agents and third parties  and determined that any impact would not be material relative to the operations of the company 
however  there can be no guarantee that actual results would not differ materially from those anticipated
