excluding the effect of the acquired businesses  sales have been relatively consistent with the prior year with increases in reactor systems and industrial pump products being offset by declines in energy systems and industrial mixers 
net income of million was higher than for fiscal diluted income per share rose to compared to for fiscal company backlog at the end of fiscal is million  down million from the prior year 
most of the decrease was from a slow down in large projects  especially large engineered systems orders within reactor systems and multiple mixer orders in industrial mixers 
the reduction in these large orders represent delays in large capital expenditures due to the recent economic uncertainty 
there is also a backlog decrease in energy systems due to the significant decline in oil prices in the businesses acquired in had little backlog at the time of acquisition 
the gross margin percent increased from for fiscal to for fiscal due to cost containment and positive contribution from the acquisitions 
operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased slightly from for fiscal to for fiscal the acquired businesses operating expenses as a percent of sales were similar to the company s 
the decrease in operating expense percent at the base businesses was due to lower levels of variable compensation and corporate cost reductions 
other income for fiscal includes income from joint ventures of million  or of net sales for fiscal  and million  or of net sales for fiscal interest expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this was due to higher average debt levels related to the acquisition costs of the acquired businesses  as the effective interest rate has remained stable 
the effective income tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal this increase was due to a reduced benefit in fiscal from the utilization of loss carryforwards outside the us as these loss carryforwards were fully realized in and in certain countries 
net deferred income tax assets of million at august  primarily relate to us operations 
future pretax income at fiscal levels would be sufficient to realize these assets

year certain software and hardware systems are time sensitive 
older time sensitive systems often use a two digit dating convention rather than that could result in system failure and disruption of operations as the year approaches 
this is referred to as the year issue 
the year issue will impact the company  its suppliers  customers and other third parties that transact business with the company 
each business unit within the company has a year team 
these teams identified issues related to substantially all hardware and software systems within the company  products sold by the company  and significant suppliers and other third parties that transact business with the company 
projects have been established to address all significant year issues 
each year team reports regularly to senior management on the progress of significant year projects 
senior management reports to the board of directors quarterly on the company s progress with year projects 
most year activities are to test hardware and software systems  including non information technology systems such as telephones and cnc machines 
the company has determined that it needs to replace or modify some of its software and hardware systems 
the company is replacing most of the systems with year issues and is reprogramming only a few software systems 
the company believes it has no material exposure to contingencies related to the year issue for products sold as few company products contain time sensitive hardware or software systems 
the company initiated communications with significant suppliers  customers and other relevant third parties to identify and minimize disruptions to the company s operations from year issues 
however  there can be no certainty that the impacted systems and products of other parties on which the company relies will be year compliant 
the estimated costs for resolving year issues are approximately million for fiscal and million for fiscal most of these costs are to replace existing software and hardware systems 
estimates of year costs are based on numerous assumptions  and actual costs could be greater than estimated 
specific factors that might cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the continuing availability of personnel trained in this area and the ability to timely identify and correct all relevant software and hardware systems 
the company believes it is diligently addressing the year issues and that it will satisfactorily resolve significant year problems 
the company anticipates completing substantially all of its year projects during fiscal  with major completion milestones being targeted for the second and fourth quarters of fiscal in the event the company falls short of these milestones  additional internal resources will be focused on completing these projects or implementing contingency plans 
forward looking statements in addition to historical information  this annual report contains various forward looking statements and performance trends which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements and trends 
such factors include  but are not limited to  a significant decline in capital expenditure levels in the company s served markets  a major decline in oil and gas prices  foreign exchange rate fluctuations  uncertainties surrounding the year issues and the new euro currency  continued availability of acceptable acquisition candidates and general economic conditions that can affect the demand in the process industries 
any forward looking statements are made based on known events and circumstances at the time

item a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risk in its normal operations the company has market risk exposure to foreign exchange rates 
as a result of the company s global operations  it has assets  liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than us dollars 
the company s significant non us operations have their local currencies as their functional currency and primarily buy and sell using that same currency 
the company manages its exposure to its net assets and cash flows in currencies other than us dollars by minimizing its us dollar net asset positions through maintaining a portion of its bank debt in italian lira and matching net asset positions in certain currencies with net liability positions in other currencies that move in similar directions in relation to the us dollar for example the italian lira and the german mark 
the company also enters into hedging transactions  primarily currency swaps under established policies and guidelines  that enable it to mitigate the potential adverse impact of foreign exchange rate risk 
the company does not engage in trading or other speculative activities with these transactions  as established policies require that such hedging transactions relate to specific currency exposures 
the company s main foreign exchange rate exposures relate to assets  liabilities and cash flows denominated in british pounds  german marks  italian lira and canadian dollars and the general economic exposure that fluctuations in these currencies could have on the dollar value of future non us cash flows 
to illustrate the potential impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the company as of august   the company s net unhedged exposures in each currency were remeasured assuming a decrease in foreign exchange rates compared to the us dollar 
using this method the company s operating income and cash flow from operations for would have decreased by million and million  respectively 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  such changes may also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales prices as competitor s products become more or less attractive 
the company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not include any effects of such potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices 
the company also has market risk exposure to interest rates 
at august   the company has million in interest bearing debt obligations that are subject to market risk exposure due to changes in interest rates 
to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  the company attempts to maintain a balance between fixed and variable rate debt 
such a balance in the debt profile is expected to moderate the company s financing cost over time 
if long term corporate interest rates were to drop substantially  the company is limited in its ability to refinance its fixed rate debt 
however  the company does have the ability to change the characteristics of its fixed rate debt to variable rate debt through interest rate swaps to achieve its objective of balance 
no such interest rate swaps are outstanding at august  at august   million of the outstanding debt is at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of and million is at variable rates with a weighted average interest rate of 
the estimated fair value of the company s debt at august   is equal to its carrying amount
