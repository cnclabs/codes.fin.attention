these increases were offset by lower shipments to the european continent and to japan 
revenue from visual identification products was up from fiscal primarily because of increased unit sales 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue was compared to in the prior year 
the lower margins in fiscal resulted from rework costs incurred to improve the operating performance of electronic readers through replacement and upgrades of components 
additionally  costs increased because of a program to exchange  without charge  electronic readers at certain animal shelters in the united states 
the margins reported from the sale of visual identification products also declined in fiscal because of changes in the mix of products sold and lower manufacturing efficiency 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal selling expenses increased during the year as a result of additions to the sales staff and increased domestic and international travel expense 
such increases were offset by lower general and administrative expenses resulting from reduced investor relations activities and lower legal fees  primarily related to reduced patent litigation costs 
research and development expenses were  in fiscal compared to  in the previous year 
the higher spending in fiscal primarily results from the salaries of new personnel and increased use of outside engineering resources that were retained to develop enhanced scanning products for the united states fisheries industry 
interest and other expenses of  remained relatively unchanged between fiscal and the company derives a significant portion of its revenue from export sales 
the gross profit and cash requirements of these sales do not vary materially from the requirements of its domestic sales 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenue in fiscal was  which represented a increase over the  recorded in fiscal revenue from the sale of electronic products increased principally because of higher sales volume in the united states fisheries market and the introduction of electronic products into the companion animal market in japan 
revenue from visual identification products rose over fiscal as a result of price increases and higher unit volumes 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue for fiscal was compared to in the prior year 
the improvement in gross margins resulted from a more profitable mix of electronic and visual products combined with higher margins on the sales of electronic readers and an increase in unit prices of certain visual identification products 
also  in fiscal  as noted below  the company incurred significant costs to retrofit and update certain reader technologies 
these costs were less significant in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses declined by to  from  in fiscal  in part due to a  reduction in legal fees in fiscal additionally  in fiscal  charges of  were recorded for the amortization of electronic readers provided under a marketing and distribution agreement  with no similar amortization expenses incurred in fiscal selling expenses remained relatively unchanged between fiscal and research and development expenses of  in fiscal were lower than the previous year s  the decrease primarily resulted from lower outside production development expenses 
interest and other expenses of  increased in fiscal compared to  for the prior year  partially due to the collection in fiscal of an indebtedness that had been charged to expense in a prior fiscal year 
further  in fiscal  the company recognized certain imputed interest on an outstanding balance payable to a vendor 
this balance was converted into a term note in june see liquidity and capital resources 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company has utilized financing sources such as public and private equity offerings and borrowings from financial institutions and individual investors to fund its operating activities 
the company believes that its cash on hand at september  and funds available under its existing credit agreement combined with funds generated by operations will provide the company with adequate liquidity and capital resources for working capital and other cash requirements for the next months 
also see discussion below regarding additional liquidity and cash flow considerations 
however  the information set forth in the preceding paragraph is forward looking information 
therefore  if  for any reason including  without limitation  those described below  the company s operations require more capital than anticipated  revenues do not reach anticipated levels  or cash flow needs are greater than planned  the company may need additional financing in order to maintain its operations 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to obtain any required additional financing when needed or that such financing  if obtained  would be on terms favorable or acceptable to the company 
if the company was unable to obtain additional financing when needed and under acceptable conditions  it would be required to significantly scale back plans for growth and perhaps reduce the scope of its operations 
factors that may affect the company s revenues  use of capital  expenses and or cash flow  and that would cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated include  but are not limited to  the introduction of competing products with performance equivalent to or exceeding that of the company s products  a claim whether or not successfully made that the company s products infringe a patent held by another company or individual  any performance problems involving the company s products  changes in technology that could cause the company s products to become obsolete  the departure of key members of management and or key employees  regulatory requirements that would make the company s products difficult or uneconomical to produce  and general economic conditions 
the company s operating activities used  during fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal  primarily to finance the net losses incurred in each of those years 
net cash used in operations also reflects increases in accounts receivable and deposits on purchase commitments to a vendor 
in fiscal and  cash flow from operating activities was also affected by depreciation and amortization and decreases in inventories 
further  fiscal funding benefitted from down payments from certain customers on new orders placed with the company 
in fiscal  an additional use of cash in operations was for the increase in inventories 
this was offset by depreciation and amortization  reductions in accounts receivable  increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and the collection of royalties receivable 
the company s investing activities used   and  for the purchase of fixed assets in fiscal  and respectively 
the company expects to expend approximately  for fixed asset additions in fiscal in fiscal  the company s financing activities used net cash of  funds were provided by an increase in net borrowings on the bank line of credit of  and were used to repay long term obligations of  in fiscal and  the company s financing activities provided net cash of  and  respectively 
primary sources of cash included the issuance of common stock in private placements and borrowings under long term obligations and lines of credit 
these were offset by repayments on long term obligations in each year  as well as a  net reduction in bank line of credit borrowings in fiscal as of september   the company had net working capital of  with a current ratio of to  which represents a  decrease in working capital from september  in january  the company sold an aggregate of  shares of common stock to two united states investors for gross proceeds of million 
also in january  the company sold an aggregate of  shares of common stock in a private placement to three foreign investors pursuant to regulation s under the securities act of for gross proceeds of  in june  the company entered into a  revolving credit facility with coast business credit  a division of southern pacific thrift loan association of los angeles  california 
the credit facility is secured by all of the company s receivables  inventories  investment property  equipment and general intangibles  as defined in the agreement 
borrowings under the facility are payable on demand and are limited to a portion of eligible accounts receivable and inventories  as defined in a borrowing formula in the agreement 
the agreement is effective through june   with provisions for extensions of the maturity date 
interest on the credit facility is paid monthly at a rate equal to the greater of eight percent or prime plus one and three quarters percent 
at september   the company had outstanding borrowings of  under the facility and had a total maximum availability under the borrowing formula of  the new revolving credit facility replaces a previous credit line agreement with a bank  and it has been used for general corporate working capital needs 
in june  the company completed an agreement with a vendor whereby a  trade payable was converted into an unsecured promissory note 
the note provides for monthly payments of  in fiscal an additional principal payment of  was required in october and further principal payments are called for under certain conditions set forth in the agreement 
the note bears interest at per annum as of september   with a scheduled increase to per annum at the beginning of fiscal year the scheduled term of the note is twenty seven months  with the final payment due in august in august  the company advised the vendor it could not comply with the original payment schedule of the promissory note and requested that the vendor reschedule the terms of the note to lower the monthly payment  retain the present interest rate and extend the payment schedule by months 
beginning in september  the company unilaterally reduced the monthly payment to  and  in october  it did not make the required  payment 
to date  there has been no definitive response to the company s request to restructure the terms of the promissory note 
in july  the company retained investment bankers to assist the company in exploring strategic alternatives for increasing shareholder value 
the potential alternatives could include  among others  the sale of the company or a division  locating a strategic investor  or making a strategic acquisition 
as discussed above and as reflected in the financial statements included in this annual report  the company incurred a net loss of  for the year ended september   and also experienced negative cash flow from operations 
in addition  the company has not complied with certain payment terms on its vendor note payable  as discussed previously  and could also be placed in default on its line of credit agreement based on the status of the vendor note 
additionally  the company s current line of credit agreement is effective through june   and although management expects to be able to renew the agreement  there can be no assurance that a renewal agreement with acceptable terms will be reached 
fiscal cash flow projections are dependent on the availability of an operating line of credit with sufficient borrowing base and achievable financial covenants from the present lender or another financing source 
as a result of these events and conditions  the auditors report on the company s financial statements as of and for the year ended september  contains a modification which indicates substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
management believes that agreements will be reached with the above mentioned vendor to restructure the outstanding note  and with the lender to renew the line of credit agreement  and that cash available under the line of credit and provided by operations will provide sufficient liquidity through at least fiscal however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve these plans 
in november  the company received notice from nasdaq that the company s common stock would be delisted from the nasdaq small cap market if the closing bid price does not trade above for consecutive trading days prior to february  the company is currently evaluating plans to comply with this requirement including the possibility of a reverse stock split that would convert up to five shares of currently issued and outstanding shares of common stock into one issued and outstanding share of common stock 
year during fiscal and  the company undertook a comprehensive review of its computer systems and related software to ensure that all systems would properly recognize year and continue to process data 
the review encompassed information technology systems  significant third party relationships and manufactured product lines 
based upon this internal assessment  the company upgraded major portions of its information systems during the first quarter of fiscal to ensure year compliance 
the cost of the evaluation and replacement of certain business systems did not have a significant impact on the company s results of operations 
the cost of approximately  was funded through operating cash flows 
these costs were attributable primarily to the purchase of new software and equipment and were expensed or capitalized on a basis consistent with the company s accounting policies for capital assets 
the company is currently in the process of evaluating the year preparedness of its customers  suppliers and service providers  by soliciting representations and assurances from such third parties 
if these representations prove to be inadequate  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
with regard to its manufactured electronic products  the company believes that its embedded technologies are year compliant 
as of the date of this annual report  the company also is in the process of preparing contingency plans to address any remaining exposures to year matters  after consideration of the above plans 
there can be no assurance that these plans will successfully mitigate all year risks

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of september   the company did not have any market risk exposure categories  as defined in item of regulation s k  and therefore  no related market risks
