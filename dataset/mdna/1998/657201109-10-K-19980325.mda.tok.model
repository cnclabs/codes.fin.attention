acellular pertussis vaccines background 
immunization against diphtheria  tetanus and pertussis using a combined vaccine during infancy and childhood is a routine practice in the united states  and the vaccination program is considered to be a major factor in reducing the incidence of  and number of deaths associated with  each of these diseases 
vaccination for the prevention of diphtheria  tetanus and pertussis currently is required in the majority of states within the united states and is scheduled to be administered to children at the ages of two  four  six  to months  and to years of age 
in addition  immunization against diphtheria  tetanus and pertussis is also required in many countries outside of the united states 
since the late s  the widespread use of whole cell dtp vaccines led to a rapid decline in disease related morbidity and mortality  especially in children 
these whole cell dtp vaccines include the entire bordetella pertussis bacterium that has been inactivated in the production process by heat or chemicals  and it is generally believed that the use of the whole cell bordetella pertussis bacterium has been a leading cause of the adverse reactions associated with the existing whole cell dtp vaccines 
these adverse reactions range from minor local reactions to more serious systemic reactions 
clinical trials have established that acellular pertussis vaccines should offer advantages over licensed whole cell pertussis vaccines with respect to improved tolerability and fewer serious adverse reactions 
the company believes that dtap vaccines are now replacing the whole cell dtp vaccines and are preferred for all doses in the immunization schedule recommended by the acip and aap 
currently  three dtap vaccines have been licensed by the fda for use in the united states 
in addition to the company  one other firm has filed for regulatory approval in the us for its dtap vaccine 
see products under development acellular pertussis vaccines dtap vaccine and competition 
dtap vaccine 
the company has developed certiva tm  an acellular pertussis vaccine in combination with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids  for use as a combined dtap vaccine in childhood immunization programs 
the company s acellular pertussis vaccine is unique and distinct from all other pertussis vaccines in that it contains only pertussis toxoid ie  pertussis toxin that has been purified and chemically inactivated by hydrogen peroxide  instead of the entire bordetella pertussis bacterium or two or more of its components 
in clinical trials  this single toxoid has been shown to induce immunity with fewer serious adverse reactions than the whole cell pertussis vaccine 
the method of manufacture for this pertussis toxoid are the subject of united states and foreign patents licensed exclusively to the company 
see business relationships 
regulatory approval to market certiva tm in the united states is pending before the fda 
in january  the company was advised by the fda that certiva tm is on track for completing the final steps for licensure 
the company has prepared and submitted additional information to the fda in furtherance of its license application 
the factors that may affect the timing for  or the ability of the company to secure  regulatory approval of certiva tm include the acceptability of the company s submissions to fda  the timeliness of the fda in completing its entire review process and the acceptability of the company s license applications in their entirety  among others 
there can be no assurances given that certiva tm will receive regulatory approval in a timely manner or at all 
see risk factors dependence upon approval and commercialization of dtap vaccines and risk factors need for regulatory approvals 
in february  a license was granted to the company s european partner  ssi  to market in sweden a european formulation of certiva tm for all recommended doses for infants and children 
the company s strategy is to file  or have filed on its behalf  regulatory applications in other selected european countries 
approvals in any of these european countries can precede and generally are not dependent upon filings with or approval by the fda 
see marketing of vaccines and business relationships 
there can be no assurance that the company s regulatory filings will be accepted or receive regulatory approval in a timely fashion or at all by the fda or any foreign regulatory authority 
see risk factors dependence upon approval and commercialization of dtap vaccine 
since  the company has been working together with the health and medical services of goteborg  sweden in a mass vaccination project in goteborg using the company s acellular pertussis vaccine to immunize  free of charge  more than  infants and children  representing more than of the eligible pediatric population in the goteborg metropolitan area 
under the vaccination project  newborn infants are receiving a european formulation of certiva tm at  and months of age  which are the recommended vaccination ages in sweden 
additionally  pre school children ages to years who have previously received their required vaccinations for diphtheria and tetanus are receiving three doses of the company s stand alone ap vaccine 
during  the company announced preliminary results from the project 
these results reveal that  within the first year following the start of the project  vaccination with these dtap and ap vaccines has dramatically reduced the incidence of pertussis infections in the goteborg area and substantially reduced the number of hospitalizations of infants due to complications from pertussis 
moreover  none of the infants and children participating in the project have experienced any serious vaccine related adverse reactions following more than  injections 
the swedish mass vaccination project  which is providing the company with additional data on the widespread use of its vaccines  is not required in order to obtain regulatory approval for certiva tm and has not been requested by any regulatory agency 
ap vaccine 
in april  the company s stand alone ap vaccine received regulatory and marketing authorization in sweden 
this approval expanded the indication in sweden for the company s ap vaccine to children previously vaccinated against diphtheria and tetanus  but who are still at risk for pertussis  and is intended to permit physicians to vaccinate older children and young adolescents against pertussis 
the company  directly or through one or more distributors  intends to seek regulatory approval for sale of the stand alone ap vaccine for use in other european countries  although there can be no assurance that any additional such approval will be granted 
the company also believes that sale of a stand alone acellular pertussis vaccine may be appropriate for adult booster immunizations 
adults are exposed to and may contract pertussis infections 
they also are considered a significant reservoir of  and source of pediatric exposure to  pertussis 
the company participated in a safety and immunogenicity clinical trial at baylor college of medicine  which was completed in  for the purpose of establishing the safety and immunogenicity of the ap vaccine as a booster in adults 
this clinical trial was sponsored by the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid of the national institutes of health  and the results of this study reveal that the company s ap vaccine is highly immunogenic in adults with no vaccine associated severe adverse reactions 
during  the vaccine and related biologics advisory committee to the fda recommended that safety and immunogenicity trials alone would be adequate to support expanded indication of ap vaccines for adolescent and adult booster doses 
the company is presently considering sponsoring such safety and immunogenicity adult clinical trials in the united states using its ap vaccine 
as part of this process  the company intends to combine the ap vaccine with an adult formulation of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids td to create a tetanus diphtheria acellular pertussis tdap vaccine for adults 
the clinical research and development for a tdap vaccine are expected to be done concurrently with  or in lieu of  the clinical development of the ap vaccine 
combination vaccines the company is developing three combination vaccines using certiva tm as an anchor 
additional vaccines would be added to certiva tm to form the combination vaccine 
the company anticipates that these combination vaccines will become generally acceptable because the acip aap recommended schedule for immunization against diphtheria  tetanus  pertussis  polio and hib are compatible 
combination vaccines have a number of benefits  including fewer injections  lower anxiety for the parents and potential reduction of the number of required visits to the physician  thereby lowering costs and facilitating compliance with recommended and mandated immunization programs 
the company s combination vaccines under development are described below 
dtap ipv vaccine 
the company believes that a single vaccination program for diphtheria  tetanus  pertussis and polio can be established by combining an enhanced  injectable ipv with certiva tm 
the company anticipates that a dtap ipv vaccine can become a generally accepted multivalent vaccine because the polio vaccination schedule is compatible with the dtap vaccination schedule  and because a polio vaccination program that includes ipv has been accepted as both safe and efficacious 
in the united states  the cdc has issued a revised recommendation related to polio vaccination 
a sequential schedule  including two doses of ipv followed by two doses of oral polio vaccination opv  is now the preferred recommendation  although a four dose opv or four dose ipv schedule is acceptable 
in september  the danish national board of health granted ssi regulatory approval to market a combined dtap ipv vaccine  which incorporates the company s acellular pertussis toxoid  for all primary and booster doses in infants and children 
this combination vaccine  which includes the company s acellular pertussis vaccine  was developed jointly by ssi and the company  and ssi holds the product rights in denmark and other scandinavian and baltic countries 
in  regulatory filings for the dtap ipv vaccine were prepared and filed in other european countries 
in addition  the company in collaboration with abbott has filed an investigational new drug application with the fda to conduct phase ii clinical trials in the united states with a dtap ipv vaccine 
there can be no assurance that the clinical trial will commence  that data from the clinical trials will support a regulatory filing or that any regulatory filings for the dtap ipv will be accepted  or receive regulatory approval in a timely fashion or at all  by other regulatory agencies

dtap hib vaccine 
the company is developing a combined single injectable dtap hib vaccine in stable liquid form for the prevention of diphtheria  tetanus  pertussis and infection caused by haemophilus influenzae type b 
preclinical test results of the company s dtap hib vaccine demonstrated high immune responses for each of the components in the combined vaccine and showed no immunologic interference among the different components of the vaccine 
the company believes that the development of a safe and immunogenic dtap hib vaccine is technologically feasible  and that a program utilizing that vaccine can become generally accepted for a number of the doses in the vaccination schedule because the vaccination schedules for diphtheria  tetanus  pertussis  and hib are compatible 
the company is presently planning clinical trials for a dtap hib vaccine in the united states

conjugate vaccines in recent decades  vaccines have been developed for certain bacterial diseases using polysaccharides long chained sugars that coat or encapsulate certain bacteria s outer membranes 
while these polysaccharide vaccines have generally proven to be safe  many of them do not elicit an adequate immune response  particularly in infants whose immature immune systems do not recognize or respond to these polysaccharides 
in an attempt to address this problem  the company is utilizing proprietary conjugate vaccine technology to link ie  conjugate polysaccharides to protein carriers  which serve to enhance the immunogenic properties of the polysaccharides by effectively carrying or showing the polysaccharide to the immune system 
the company believes that conjugate vaccines may prove as safe as and more effective than polysaccharide vaccines 
the company holds exclusive worldwide rights excluding canada for the development  production and sale of vaccines against certain bacterial infections under a license granted by the national research council of canada  a canadian federal government agency nrc  for certain conjugate vaccine technology 
united states and  in some cases  foreign patents relating to this technology have been issued and applied for 
the company also holds  either as assignee or licensee  several other patents related to the development and manufacture of conjugate vaccines 
the company is developing conjugate vaccines for the diseases discussed below and  where appropriate  intends to combine certain of its conjugate vaccines with its dtap and dtap ipv vaccines

group b streptococcal vaccine 
group b streptococcal gbs infection affects all age groups in the united states and is the most common cause of life threatening infections  including sepsis meningitis in newborns 
gbs infections in infants occur principally during the first three months after birth and can result in serious complications  including death  pneumonia or permanent brain damage from meningitis 
disease in newborns during the first week of life generally is caused by infection of the infant passing through the mother s colonized birth canal 
gbs disease is also a prominent cause of peripartum maternal infections 
since there is no vaccine for the prevention of gbs disease in adults or infants  the cdc has issued guidelines for detecting and treating gbs infections in pregnant women 
these guidelines  which have been adopted by the american academy of pediatrics and the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists  include diagnostic testing during the third trimester and  for those infected  a course of intravenous antibiotics during and after labor 
a primary target market for this vaccine will be women of child bearing age 
a principal benefit to such an immunization program is that the vaccine has the potential to generate protective antibodies for both the mother and the infant 
a vaccine against gbs infection  utilizing patented technologies that the company has licensed from the nrc  the brigham and women s hospital  and harvard university  has been tested in a phase i ii clinical trial conducted under the sponsorship of the niaid 
in that trial  the vaccine was well tolerated with minimal reactogenicity and no serious side effects in healthy  nonpregnant women subjects 
antibodies elicited by immunization with the conjugate vaccine displayed protective activity against multiple gbs serotypes in vitro and in vivo 
in addition  the clinical investigators reported that the delivery of a gbs polysaccharide conjugate vaccine through maternal immunization may be a realistic approach to the prevention of perinatal gbs infection and that antibodies transported through the placenta to the fetus may confer protective immunity even to infants born prematurely between and weeks of gestation 
trials for this gbs vaccine have been expanded  and the vaccine is currently in phase ii clinical trials 
the company is presently planning a phase iii clinical study for its vaccine in nonpregnant adolescent girls and women 
meningococcal vaccines 
meningitis is a serious infection involving the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord  which can lead to significant central nervous system damage in all age groups  although in the united states those most often stricken are children and young adults 
serogroups a  b and c of neisseria meningitidis meningococcus cause a significant number of cases of meningitidis and systemic meningococcemia 
the incidence of meningitis caused by group a  b and c meningococcus varies from country to country  with group b and c meningococcus accounting for nearly all disease in developed countries 
currently  a polysaccharide vaccine for the prevention of group a and c meningococcal infections is licensed in the united states and is predominantly used in the adult population  and in particular  is routinely administered to united states military personnel 
this vaccine has not been demonstrated to be protective in children less than two years of age 
in addition  there is currently no licensed conjugate vaccine for the prevention of group b meningococcal infection 
group b meningococcal bacteria have been responsible for most cases of meningococcal meningitis in developed countries since the late s  and in the united states account for approximately one half of the yearly cases of such meningitis the other half being attributable principally to group c meningococcal bacteria 
epidemic outbreaks occur periodically in the united states  south america and europe 
the company has developed a group b meningococcal conjugate vaccine utilizing an unique carrier protein which appears to reduce many of the previously reported problems associated with the development of an effective group b meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine 
at the end of  the company entered into agreements with pasteur merieux connaught to jointly develop this conjugate vaccine  and the two companies successfully collaborated in on preclinical primate studies for this group b meningococcal conjugate vaccine that confirmed its safety and immunogenicity 
these studies demonstrated that the conjugate vaccine made using the company s proprietary technologies elicited in vivo superior bactericidal responses to other group b meningococcal vaccines 
in addition  the company and pasteur merieux connaught together are planning to file an investigational new drug application with the fda to begin a phase i clinical trial in adults 
see business relationships pasteur merieux connaught agreements 
the company is also developing conjugate vaccines against group a and c meningococcal disease and group a c and group a b c meningococcal disease for adults and infants 
the company has completed preclinical development and testing of its group a and group a c meningococcal conjugate vaccines  as well as a phase i clinical trial of its group c meningococcal conjugate vaccine in adults 
the results from the phase i clinical trial in the united kingdom revealed that the group c meningococcal vaccine was well tolerated with minimal reactogenicity and no serious side effects 
antibodies elicited by immunization with the conjugate vaccine displayed protective activity against group c meningococcal bacterial infection by eliciting functional bactericidal antibodies 
the company is presently participating in phase ii clinical trials of the vaccine in infants and children in the united kingdom to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine  and expects to participate in a clinical study of the vaccine in uk adolescents 
the clinical development and testing of these vaccines are expected to take several years to complete 
haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine 
hib has been a frequent cause of meningitis and other serious infections in infants and children 
the acip has issued a recommendation for universal vaccination of children for protection against diseases caused by hib 
vaccination against hib consists of either a two or three dose primary regimen depending on vaccine used  with primary doses administrated at the ages of two  four and six months and a booster dose administered at between to months of age 
children infected with hib bacteria can develop meningitis  which can lead to blindness  deafness  acquired mental retardation or death 
the peak incidence of hib infection in the united states occurs in children between six and months of age 
the company has developed more than one conjugate vaccine against hib for use in infants and children and for possible use in the company s combination vaccines 
see products under development combination vaccines 
the company has completed its preclinical development of these vaccines 
three manufacturers are currently licensed by the fda to sell hib conjugate vaccines for use in all primary and booster doses 
see competition 
group a streptococcal vaccine 
group a streptococcal disease occurs in all age groups with a predominance in school age children 
group a streptococcus causes infections ranging from severe sore throat and sinus infection to pneumonia and toxic streptococcal syndrome 
sequelae of group a streptococcal infections include rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis 
currently  there is no vaccine licensed by the fda to prevent group a streptococcal infection 
the company is engaged in the research and development of a conjugate vaccine to prevent this infection 
activities on this vaccine are in the preclinical stage 
pneumococcal otitis media vaccine 
otitis media  or middle ear infection  is a common illness in the united states afflicting children under five years of age 
the majority of bacterial cases are attributable to pneumococcal organisms 
chronic otitis media can lead to hearing defects and associated learning and language disabilities 
there is no vaccine licensed by the fda that prevents otitis media caused by pneumococcal bacteria 
the company is pursuing efforts to develop a conjugate vaccine to prevent pneumococcal otitis media 
this vaccine is currently in the preclinical stage of development 
pneumococcal pneumonia vaccine 
there are in excess of serotypes of pneumococcal bacteria that cause pneumonia  a respiratory infection that affects individuals of all ages  as well as other infections 
the present pneumococcal vaccine is a multivalent polysaccharide vaccine recommended for adults  particularly elderly and other patients with a high risk of contracting pneumonia 
the company is currently in the preclinical stage of the development of a multivalent conjugate vaccine against pneumococcus 
other vaccines the company  utilizing patented and proprietary technologies  is performing research on and developing other adult and pediatric vaccines  which it selects for development based on the anticipated need for a particular product  the nature of the competition  and the ability of the company to develop the product  among other factors 
the company s research and development efforts are being conducted independently and in conjunction or in collaboration with governmental agencies and universities 
there are no assurances that any of these vaccines will enter clinical trials or successfully be developed or licensed by the fda or any other regulatory authority for commercial sale 
marketing of vaccines an objective of the company is to become a leader in the development  production and marketing of state of the art vaccines for the prevention of human infectious diseases 
in pursuing this objective  the company considers  among other things  collaborations with pharmaceutical and other vaccine manufacturers where appropriate to maximize the value of the company s products and technologies 
to maximize market penetration for its first commercial products within the least amount of time  the company currently is implementing a marketing strategy aimed at establishing marketing alliances in the united states  europe and other territories with well established local partners on a country by country basis 
thereafter  the company intends to develop  where appropriate and feasible  an internal sales force to succeed these alliances following expiration of the respective agreements 
towards this end  the company has entered into marketing alliances for certain products in the united states and selected countries within europe 
the company will continue to seek distribution  marketing  joint venture and similar arrangements with third parties in other territories and for other products where  in the judgement of the company  such arrangements would be beneficial to the successful commercialization of its products

the company and abbott will collaborate in the clinical development of the combination vaccines  and abbott will provide the company with clinical development funding 
the company will receive payments upon achievement of prescribed milestones 
the agreement provides for total payments of up to million by abbott  of which the company has received million to date 
in addition  the company will receive revenues from abbott as it purchases certiva tm and the combination vaccine products for resale to the private pediatric market 
each party is subject to prescribed diligence obligations 
the agreement will expire on the expiration of the patents covering the products to be marketed 
in addition  the agreement may be terminated by abbott in its sole discretion at any time with advance notice

other relationships 
the company holds licenses and other rights to additional technologies that the company is researching and or developing jointly with various research institutions 
in addition  the company is in various stages of discussions with third parties  including multinational pharmaceutical companies  regarding various business arrangements  including acquisitions  licensing  research and development  distribution  marketing  joint venture and other business agreements  some of which possibly may be concluded in the near term 
there are no assurances that the company will successfully negotiate and sign any such agreement or that  if executed  the financial terms of any such agreement will be significant 
competition competition in the vaccine industry is intense 
the company will face competition from many companies  including a number of large companies and specialized firms in the united states and abroad that are engaged in the development and production of vaccines  and major universities and research institutions 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources  more extensive experience in conducting clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approvals for their products  greater operating experience  larger research and development and marketing staffs  and greater production capabilities than those of the company 
the company believes that the principal competitive factors in the vaccine industry are product quality  measured by the safety and efficacy of a vaccine product  ease of administration represented by combination vaccines and vaccines that are stable in liquid form and price 
see marketing of vaccines 
the company believes that its principal competitors in the united states are wyeth lederle a subsidiary of american home products  merck co  smithkline beecham plc  and pasteur merieux connaught  most of which are active in the development of acellular pertussis  combination and conjugate vaccines for use in infants and children 
for example  over the past two years  three companies announced that they had received fda approval for their dtap vaccine for infants and children 
one of these competitors also announced that the fda licensed a vaccine that combines by reconstitution that company s hib vaccine with its dtap vaccine for administration at months of age and that it continues to seek fda approval for administration of this combination vaccine at two  four and six months of age 
in addition  several competing dtap vaccines and certain combination vaccines have been licensed for sale outside of the united states 
see risk factors competition and technological change 
patents and proprietary information the company actively pursues a strategy of seeking patent protection for valuable patentable subject matter 
the company believes that patent and trade secret protection is an important element of its business and that its success will depend in part on its ability to obtain strong patents  to maintain trade secret protection  and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
the company holds as assignee and licensee a number of patents and patent applications 
see business relationships and risk factors patent protection and proprietary information 
the company also relies upon trade secrets  know how and continuing technological advancement to develop and maintain its competitive position 
disclosure and use of the company s know how is generally controlled under agreements with the parties involved 
in addition  the company has confidentiality agreements with its employees  consultants and officers 
there can be no assurance that disclosure of the company s trade secrets will not occur  or that others will not independently develop and patent equivalent technology 
government regulation the company is currently subject to regulation by various governmental agencies and to federal and other laws 
united states and foreign regulations will be a significant factor in the production and marketing of the company s products and are currently a significant factor in its ongoing research and development activities 
in order to test  produce and market vaccines  mandatory procedures must be followed to ensure that safety  quality and efficacy standards established by the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries are satisfied 
see also risk factors changes in government purchasing policies for a description of regulatory and legislative initiatives that may affect the marketing and distribution of vaccines 
in the united states  the marketing of human vaccines is subject to fda review and approval 
the steps required before a new human vaccine can be marketed include preclinical studies  the filing of an investigational new drug application ind with the fda  clinical trials in humans to determine safety and efficacy  the filing of a product establishment license application  fda approval of the product for commercial sale  and fda approval of the production related facilities 
the results of the preclinical studies and human clinical trials are submitted to the fda in a product license application pla  approval of which must be obtained prior to commencement of commercial sales 
the fda may deny a pla if  among other reasons  clinical trial protocols are not adequate or appropriate 
the fda also may require additional testing or information to assess the safety and efficacy of a company s products if the fda does not view the pla as containing adequate evidence of the safety and efficacy of the product 
notwithstanding the submission of such data  the fda may ultimately decide that the application does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval 
even if the pla is approved  the product may be required to undergo post licensure testing and surveillance to continue to monitor its safety and effectiveness 
at this stage  product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur following initial marketing 
these regulatory standards relate to  among other things  manufacturing  testing  labelling  advertising and marketing 
the interval between the filing of an ind and the filing of a pla application can be lengthy and in some instances the data obtained from clinical trials authorized under an ind do not support the filing of a pla 
the product manufacturing and support facilities also must be licensed for the production of vaccines 
to accomplish this  an establishment license application ela must be filed with the fda 
the ela describes the facilities  equipment and personnel involved in the manufacturing process 
an establishment license is granted on the basis of inspections of the applicant s facilities in which the primary focus is on compliance with fda s current good manufacturing practices cgmp and the applicant s ability to consistently manufacture the product in the facility in accordance with the pla 
if the fda finds the inspection unsatisfactory  it may decline to approve the ela  resulting in a delay in production or distribution by the applicant 
although reviewed separately  approval of both the pla and ela must be received prior to commercial marketing of a vaccine 
the fda modernization act of  which became effective on february   is intended to reform the fda s review and approval processes by  among other things  streamlining the product licensing application processes for biologics  including vaccines 
provisions of the new law are designed to eliminate the requirement for separate elas and to simplify the approval process 
the fda is in the process of developing implementing regulations and guidelines  which is expected to take months and perhaps years to complete 
at this time the company is unable to predict the effect that this new law or its implementing regulations and guidelines may have on the fda s application or approval process for certiva tm or the company s other vaccines  or on the company s business or results of future operations 
the fda export reform and enhancement act of  which became effective on april   revised the terms and conditions under which biologics may be exported 
the legislation was designed to facilitate the export of drugs  including biologics 
the new legislation now permits  provided that certain conditions are satisfied  a company to commercially export vaccines manufactured in the united states with little or no prior fda review or approval before these vaccines are licensed by the fda for marketing in the united states 
preclinical studies are conducted in the laboratory and in animal systems to evaluate the safety  immunogenicity and potential efficacy of vaccines 
the results of these preclinical studies are submitted as part of the ind 
human clinical trials may commence if  days after receipt by the fda of the ind  the fda does not notify the ind applicant that the trials are subject to a clinical hold 
clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new vaccine to healthy volunteers or to patients  under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator 
clinical trials are conducted in accordance with certain standards under protocols that detail the objectives of the study  the parameters to be used to monitor safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated 
each protocol must be submitted to the fda as part of the ind and is subject to fda approval 
further  each clinical study must be conducted under the auspices of an independent institutional review board irb at the institution at which the study will be conducted or by a qualified centralized independent irb 
the irb must approve the study to be conducted 
in its review  the irb will consider  among other things  ethical factors  the safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution 
clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases  but the phases may overlap 
in phase i  the initial introduction of the vaccine into healthy human subjects  the vaccine is tested for safety adverse effects  optimal dosage  and its ability to induce an immune response immunogenicity 
phase ii involves studies in limited target patient populations to further evaluate immunogenicity and optimal dosage  and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks 
when a product is found to have an acceptable safety profile in phase ii evaluations  phase iii clinical trials are undertaken to evaluate clinical efficacy or some measure thereof and to further test for safety within an expanded target patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites 
clinical trials generally require several years to complete and may be very costly 
to date  the company has been successful in reducing the cost of clinical trials by obtaining third party sponsorship of the clinical trials for its first vaccine products 
the company  where appropriate  may continue to seek third party sponsorship or funding for clinical trials for its vaccine products 
there can be no assurance that such sponsorship or funding  if sought  will be obtained 
the company s activities are subject to specific government quality assurance regulations 
the fda s cgmp regulations set specific requirements for the production of biologics  including vaccines  and the failure to satisfy these regulations can result in delays in  or suspension or withdrawals of  export authorizations or us regulatory approvals 
similar requirements are also in effect in the european union and other foreign countries where the company has applied or may apply for regulatory approval for clinical studies and or marketing of its vaccines 
the company s research and operations also are subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health agency  the environmental protection agency  the department of agriculture  and the department of transportation 
the company also is subject to regulation under the toxic substances control act  the resource conservation and recovery act  and other regulatory statutes  and may in the future be subject to other federal  state  local or foreign regulations 
the company s compliance with laws that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relate to the protection of the environment does not have a material effect on the ongoing operations of the company 
the company has not made any material expenditures for environmental control facilities  nor does it anticipate any such expenditures during the current fiscal year 
raw materials laboratory supplies utilized in the company s research and development generally are available from several commercial suppliers under standard terms and conditions 
most raw materials necessary for process development  scale up and commercial manufacturing are generally available from multiple commercial suppliers 
however  certain processes require raw materials from sole sources or materials that are difficult for suppliers to produce and certify to the company s specifications 
in addition  the company may experience temporary or permanent shortages of critical raw materials necessary for continued production of its vaccines 
accordingly  given the specific nature of  and critical need for  certain raw materials  there is a risk that material shortages could delay production efforts  adversely impact production costs and yields  and even necessitate the use of substitute materials 
any of these events could have a significant adverse impact on the company s operations 
see also risk factors dependence on suppliers 
product liability the testing and marketing of vaccines entail an inherent risk of product liability attributable to unwanted and potentially serious health effects 
the extent of this risk was sufficiently great in the united states that  by the mid s  many manufacturers ceased production of pediatric vaccines because of liability exposure 
in response to these withdrawals from the vaccine market  congress enacted the ncvi act to ensure the availability of government mandated pediatric vaccines by addressing the liability of manufacturers for immunization related injuries 
among other things  the ncvi act created a trust fund  supported by an excise tax on each dose of vaccine sold  to compensate eligible injured parties 
compensation awards are statutorily established and are generally limited to actual and projected unreimbursed medical  rehabilitative and custodial expenses  lost earnings  and pain and suffering  together with reasonable attorneys fees 
injured parties are not allowed to bring a lawsuit against the manufacturer unless they have filed a claim with the program  received a final determination and rejected it in favor of litigation 
the ncvi act may not  however  protect vaccine manufacturers against liability if the conditions of the ncvi act are not satisfied  or against suits by family members of an injured party 
as the vaccines covered by the ncvi act include vaccines for the prevention of diphtheria  tetanus  pertussis  polio and hib  the company s dtap  ipv and hib vaccines have certain protection from liability claims 
while none of the company s other products are presently covered by the ncvi act  from time to time there are legislative and regulatory proposals to expand the list of vaccines covered by  and to reduce the excise taxes that fund  the program 
the company is unable to predict whether any other legislative or regulatory proposal will ultimately be enacted or the effect any of these proposals may ultimately have on the company s business or results of future operations 
the company has limited product liability insurance coverage 
it intends to seek additional insurance coverage as it commences commercialization of its vaccines  but there can be no assurance that adequate additional insurance coverage will be available at acceptable costs  if at all  or that a product liability claim would not materially adversely affect the business or financial condition of the company 
see risk factors product liability  limited insurance 
employees as of december   the company had full time employees of whom have phd degrees and two have phd degrees 
of these employees  were engaged in research  development and production activities  were engaged in administration  and were engaged in quality regulatory and related aspects of the company s operations 
the company considers its relationship with employees to be satisfactory 
risk factors in addition to the other information included herein  the following risk factors should be carefully considered 
this annual report on form k contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of and made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  which statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties that may affect the company s business and prospects 
the company s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section 
dependence upon approval and commercialization of dtap vaccine 
the company has generated only limited revenue from the sale of its acellular pertussis vaccine 
prior to commercial introduction  certiva tm and the company s combination vaccines must be approved by the fda for sales in the united states and by similar authorities for sales in other countries 
a european formulation of certiva tm and a stand alone ap vaccine have been approved for sale in sweden  and a dtap ipv vaccine has been approved for sale in denmark 
certiva tm is currently being considered for approval for sale in the united states by the fda 
there can be no assurance as to when or whether the company will receive such approval  or that any such approval will not be subject to additional testing requirements or other limitations that may affect the commercialization of the product 
the commercial introduction of certiva tm will require the company to manufacture and produce large quantities of vaccine in its manufacturing facility  which has been and continues to be modified for increased production 
the company has limited experience in manufacturing commercial quantities of its vaccines  including certiva tm  and operating its manufacturing facilities 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the production process will not fail at any point or become subject to substantial disruptions 
see risk factors manufacturing and scale up 
to successfully introduce and commercialize certiva tm  the company will be required to  among other things  participate in established purchasing programs of federal and state governments  establish an identity and reputation for the company and its products  create an awareness among pediatricians of the safety and efficacy of the vaccine  distinguish the company s product from that of its competitors  establish the company as an effective and reliable supplier of vaccines  produce sufficient quantities of vaccine and establish effective distribution channels 
the company and abbott have signed an agreement for abbott to market certiva tm and certain combination vaccines in the united states to the private physician and managed care markets upon approval by the fda  with the company marketing those products to government purchasers 
there can be no assurance that the company or abbott will successfully implement its sales and marketing strategy 
in attempting to do so  the company believes there will be intense competition from other vaccine producers 
there can be no assurance that the company will produce a commercially viable product  attain sufficient market share  distinguish its vaccine product from that of its competitors  or achieve profitability from the sale of certiva tm or any of its other vaccine products 
see risk factors competition and risk factors lack of profitability 
currently  the company s prospects for becoming profitable are substantially dependent upon the successful commercialization of certiva tm  as well as the successful development and commercialization of other vaccines under development 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully manufacture or market certiva tm or any other vaccine product at levels sufficient to generate profits 
see risk factors lack of profitability 
manufacturing and scale up 
the production of vaccines is a highly complex  biological process involving many steps  commencing from seed culture through final production 
the production process could fail at any point resulting in the failure and continued inability to meet production requirements 
the company has limited experience in manufacturing commercial quantities of its vaccine products and in operating its manufacturing facilities 
from time to time  the company experiences disruptions and production failures and there are no assurances that the steps taken by the company to address such failures will be effective or that such failures will not continue in the future or affect the company s ability to obtain regulatory approval for its products or the timing of such approval or affect the company s ability to produce vaccines 
no assurances can be given that the company will be successful in establishing and maintaining consistent manufacture and continuous commercial production of its vaccines in sufficient quantity and quality or that it will be capable of producing a competitively priced product for commercial sale 
the company s manufacturing operations for certiva tm are located principally in one facility 
any condition or event that adversely affects the operation of such facility would have a material adverse affect on the company s financial condition and future results of operations 
in addition  given its size and configuration  such facility has limited production capacity 
accordingly  there are no assurances that the company will be able to produce sufficient quantities of vaccine to meet market demand or achieve profitability 
dependence on suppliers 
while the company produces the pertussis component of certiva tm  it has purchased  and intends to continue to purchase  its requirements of the diphtheria and tetanus toxoids from ssi and enhanced ipv from ssi and another supplier 
there can be no assurance that these suppliers will be able to meet the company s requirements  that their components will be supplied on commercially reasonable terms  or that they will not experience difficulties in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals or disruptions in their production of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids or ipv 
certain of the company s production processes require raw materials from sole sources or materials that are difficult for suppliers to produce and certify to the company s specifications 
the company also may experience temporary or permanent shortages of critical raw materials necessary for continued production of its vaccines 
any shortage of these materials could delay production efforts  adversely impact production costs and yields  or necessitate the use of substitute materials  any of which could have a significant adverse impact on the company s operations 
in addition  the company has contracted with third parties for the sterile fill  labelling  and packaging of its vaccine products until the company obtains its own facilities to perform these operations 
failure of any such contractor to meet the company s requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company  may involve costly delays and significant expense  and would require additional regulatory approval as the company seeks alternative arrangements 
changes in government purchasing policies 
children in the united states receive immunizations from public providers  such as local health departments  as well as from private providers 
immunizations provided by public providers are generally paid for through federal and state government funding under public health programs 
these programs are intended to reduce barriers to immunization and to improve immunization rates by providing free vaccine to qualifying infants and children 
government purchases historically have been at prices substantially below those offered to the private sector and presently account for a substantial portion of the vaccine doses distributed in the united states 
from time to time  legislative and regulatory initiatives are proposed that  if adopted  could significantly modify government vaccine programs by  among other things  modifying or restricting the federal government s purchasing authority or substantially increasing or reducing the funding available for government vaccine purchases 
the company is unable to predict which legislative initiative  if any  will ultimately be enacted or the effect any such initiative may ultimately have on the company s business or results of future operations 
in addition  proposals for health care  insurance and tax reform may be considered in the future by federal and state governments and some of these proposals  if adopted  may limit government or third party  private reimbursement policies  or prices charged by pharmaceutical and vaccine manufacturers for their product 
no assurance of effective marketing 
the company has little experience in marketing its products 
the company is in the process of implementing its marketing and sales plans for its products  however  there can be no assurance that the company s current marketing and sales strategies or the size and make up of the company s sales and marketing organization will be sufficient for the successful commercialization of its products 
the factors affecting successful commercial launch of the company s vaccines in the united states include  among others establishing an identity and reputation for the company and its products  creating an awareness among pediatricians of the safety and efficacy of the company s vaccines  distinguishing the company s products from those of its competitors  establishing the company as an effective and reliable supplier of vaccines  establishing efficient and consistent production of sufficient quantities of vaccine  and establishing effective distribution channels 
the company has entered into supply  marketing and distribution agreements with third parties under which such parties hold exclusive rights to market certain of the company s products within their respective territories 
there can be no assurance that any of these third parties will be able to distribute and market those products successfully within its territory 
there also can be no assurance that the company will be successful in negotiating and executing marketing and or distribution agreements with any other third parties covering any products or that any other third party will be able to market the company s products successfully 
see business relationships 
uncertainties related to clinical trials 
before obtaining regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any products under development  the company must demonstrate through pre clinical studies and clinical trials that these products are safe and effective 
the results from pre clinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of results obtained in large scale clinical trials 
there can be no assurance that large scale clinical trials for any of the company s products will demonstrate safety and efficacy  be sufficient to support application for regulatory approval  or lead to marketable products 
a number of companies in the biotechnology industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials even after achieving promising results in earlier trials 
need for regulatory approvals 
the company has not commercialized any products or received product approval from the fda 
the company s vaccine products  product development activities and manufacturing facilities and processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the fda  including preclinical and clinical testing requirements  and inspection and approval processes 
approval of the company s products for commercial introduction in the united states currently requires both a license for each product and a license for each production facility 
the process of obtaining licenses can be costly and time consuming  and there can be no assurance that the licenses will be granted  or that fda review will not involve delays that would adversely affect the company s ability to market products 
there also can be no assurance that any of the products under development by the company will demonstrate the safety or efficacy profiles necessary for regulatory approval  or that the company s products under development or its production facility will receive the requisite regulatory approvals and licenses in a timely fashion or at all 
there also can be no assurance that the fda or other regulatory authorities will not require the company to conduct additional testing to assess the safety and or efficacy of the company s vaccines  including certiva tm 
even if the necessary licenses are obtained from the fda  there may be limitations imposed that affect the commercialization of the product  including limitations on product use  and the fda can withdraw approvals at any time upon compliance with appropriate regulatory procedures 
the fda can also limit or prevent the manufacture or distribution of the company s products both in the united states and abroad and can require recalls of products 
the fda regulations depend heavily on administrative and scientific interpretation and advisory committee determinations  and there can be no assurance that future interpretations by the fda or other regulatory bodies  with possible prospective and retroactive effect  will not adversely affect the company 
in addition  the fda and various state agencies inspect the company and its facilities from time to time to determine whether the company is in compliance with regulations  including manufacturing  testing  recordkeeping  quality control and labelling practices 
a determination that the company is in material violation of such regulations could have a material adverse effect on the company  including  without limitation  product recalls  suspensions or withdrawals of licenses  revocation or suspension of export authorizations  and denials of any pending applications 
patent protection and proprietary information 
the vaccine industry traditionally has placed considerable importance on obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies  products and processes 
the company believes that such protection will be an important factor in its success and may require the expenditure of substantial resources 
many companies  universities and research institutions have applied for and or obtained patents for vaccine products and technologies that may be competitive or inconsistent with those held by or licensed to the company 
no assurances can be given as to the degree and range of protection any patents will afford the company  that additional patents will be issued to the company  or as to the extent to which the company will be successful in avoiding any patents granted to others 
further  there can be no assurance that others have not or will not independently develop or otherwise properly gain access to technology or information that is substantially similar to that which is unpatented yet considered proprietary by the company 
the company also may desire or be required to obtain licenses from others in order to develop  produce and market commercially viable products effectively 
failure to obtain those licenses could have a significant adverse effect on the company s ability to commercialize its vaccine products 
there can be no assurance that such licenses will be obtainable on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  that the patents underlying such licenses will be valid and enforceable or that the proprietary nature of the unpatented technology underlying such licenses will remain proprietary 
there has been  and the company believes that there may be in the future  significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
if the company becomes involved in such litigation  it could consume substantial resources 
competition and technological change 
competition in the vaccine industry is intense 
competitors of the company both in the united states and internationally include major pharmaceutical and chemical companies  specialized biotechnology firms  universities and other research institutions 
many of these competitors are actively developing competing vaccines 
for example  during the past two years  three competitors announced that their respective dtap vaccines were approved by the fda for use in infants and children 
one of those competitors also announced that the fda licensed a vaccine that combines by reconstitution that company s hib vaccine with its dtap vaccine for administration at months of age and that it continues to seek fda approval for administration at two  four and six months of age 
in addition  several competitors dtap vaccines and certain combination vaccines have been licensed for sale outside of the united states 
many of these competitors have substantially greater resources  more extensive experience in conducting clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approvals for their products  greater operating experience  larger research and development and marketing staffs  and greater production capabilities than those of the company 
in addition  the vaccine industry is subject to significant technological change 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not succeed in designing around the company s patents  developing technologies and products that are as or more effective than any that have been or are being developed by the company  or developing technologies and products that would render the company s technology and products obsolete and noncompetitive 
product liability  limited insurance 
the testing and marketing of vaccine products entail an inherent risk of product liability 
although the company has limited product liability insurance coverage  it intends to seek additional insurance coverage as it commences commercialization of its products 
there can be no assurance that adequate additional insurance coverage will be available at acceptable cost  if at all  or that a product liability claim would not materially adversely affect the business or financial condition of the company 
to the extent the company is not covered by insurance  the company faces potential liability that could be substantial in the event of claims 
lack of profitability 
the company s accumulated deficit as of december  was approximately million  and the company presently has limited revenues 
the company expects to incur additional losses until such time as the company makes significant commercial sales of one or more of its vaccine products 
the company s ability to achieve and maintain profitability is dependent upon its ability to develop products that are effective and commercially viable  to continue to obtain regulatory approvals for production and sale of its products  and to produce and market its products successfully and in sufficient quantities 
there can be no assurance that the company will become profitable 
see risk factors dependence upon approval and commercialization of dtap vaccine 
availability of capital 
it is anticipated that the company will continue to expend significant amounts of capital to fund its operations and capital expenditures 
the company plans to finance its cash requirements through a combination of cash and cash equivalents  revenues from product sales and from license  collaboration  marketing  distribution and or development agreements  the exercise of stock options  the sale of debt and or equity securities  mortgage financing  lines of credit  and equipment leases 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to satisfy its funding requirements from any of these alternatives or that it will be effective in reducing cash requirements for operations if fda approval is not timely received 
see item selected financial data  and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
dependence on attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
the company s success in developing marketable products and achieving a competitive position will depend  in part  on its ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and no assurance can be given that the company will be able to continue to attract or retain such personnel 
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect the company 
dividends and taxation 
the company has never paid cash dividends on its common stock 
the company currently intends to retain earnings  if any  to finance the growth and development of its business and does not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
moreover  any profits earned by the us subsidiary of the company will not be distributable directly to the company s shareholders 
instead  such subsidiary must declare and pay a dividend to the company  and the company in turn must declare a dividend to its shareholders 
this will subject each dividend to a withholding tax 
see item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters  and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
impact of becoming a passive foreign investment company 
if more than a certain percentage of the company s assets or income become passive  the company will be classified for us tax purposes as a passive foreign investment company pfic  and a us taxpayer may be subject to an additional federal income tax on receiving certain dividends from the company or selling the company s common stock 
see item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters  and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
voting control by principal shareholders 
the principal shareholders of the company  biochem and dr 
phillip frost  either directly or through affiliates  are parties to a shareholders agreement requiring  among other things  that the company s common stock covered by the agreement be voted together for the election of directors 
as of february   these principal shareholders beneficially owned approximately  shares of the company s outstanding common stock  which represented approximately of the company s then outstanding common stock 
see item certain relationships and related transactions 
volatility of stock price 
the market prices for securities of many biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  including the company  have been highly volatile 
many factors have historically had  and are expected to continue to have  a significant impact on the company s business and on the market price of the company s securities including announcements by the company and others regarding the results of regulatory approval filings  clinical trials or other testing  technological innovations or new commercial products by the company or its competitors  government regulations  developments concerning proprietary rights  public concern as to safety of vaccine and pharmaceutical products  and economic or other external factors 
shares eligible for future sale 
sales of substantial amounts of the company s common stock in the public market following the exercise of options or the conversion of convertible securities could have an adverse effect on the price of the company s securities 
to the extent that either of the two principal shareholder groups determines to sell a substantial number of their shares of the company s common stock  such sales could significantly increase the volatility of the market price of the issued and outstanding securities of the company 
in addition  one of the principal shareholders holds certain registration rights concerning shares of the company s common stock that it owns

the company has modified and continues to modify its  square foot production facility to expand production capacity for certiva tm 
see item business  risk factors manufacturing and scale up 
in  the company acquired a  square foot production facility in beltsville  maryland 
the acquisition included the purchase and lease of equipment and leasehold improvements and the assumption of real estate leases underlying the facility  which are scheduled to expire in  subject to two five year extensions 
the facility is being dedicated to the production of vaccines for clinical trials and commercial sale 
the company owns a building located adjacent to its current production facility 
this building has been modified to house the service and warehouse departments that support the company s production facility 
the company is presently subleasing space for a research and development laboratory facility 
this facility  consisting of approximately  square feet  is used for research in areas such as protein chemistry  immunology  molecular biology and conjugation technology 
the company reached a preliminary understanding with a real estate investment trust to lease an approximately  square foot facility for a period of ten years  with two five year renewal options 
the initial base annual rent under the lease would be approximately  with minimum annual escalations 
at the end of the fifth year of the initial term  the company would have the right to terminate the lease for a specified fee 
in addition  the company would have an option to purchase the facility during specified periods of the lease term 
the trust would provide the company with an allowance of approximately million for tenant improvements  and would make available to the company a line of credit of up to approximately million to fund any additional improvements in excess of the tenant improvement allowance

the negotiations on these agreements are substantially completed and these agreements may be executed in the near future 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to negotiate successfully and sign the terms of a definitive lease for the facility or the line of credit  or that  if these documents are executed  the financial terms thereof would not be materially different 
if the company secures this facility  it intends to consolidate its general  administrative  research and development groups in this facility and to reduce its existing leased space for those functions

instead  for those profits to be distributed to shareholders  the subsidiary must declare a dividend to the company  and the company in turn must declare a dividend to its shareholders 
this will subject each dividend to a withholding tax 
first  the dividend from the subsidiary to the company will be subject to a withholding tax imposed by the united states on the gross amount of the dividend 
pursuant to the canada united states income tax convention the treaty  the subsequent dividend paid by the company to a shareholder resident in the united states will be subject to canadian withholding tax at the rate of on the gross amount of the dividend

the gain that is allocated to a prior year subsequent to december  in which the company was a pfic  or any subsequent year other than the year of disposition  will be taxed at the highest marginal rate for that year and such tax will be subject to an interest charge as if it had originally been due in that year 
in addition  gain realized on the disposition of the united states taxpayer s common stock that is allocated to the current year or to a prior year before the company was a pfic will be treated as ordinary income

revenue from collaborative agreements in were principally with abbott and pasteur merieux connaught 
production expenses were million in compared to million in the increase in these expenses in is due to increases in materials  labor  and facilities operating costs as the company produces its acellular pertussis vaccine for european distribution and prepares for regulatory approval of certiva tm in the united states 
the increase in labor cost is attributable primarily to an increase in the number of employees 
production costs attributable to the company s products  including certiva tm  are expensed until regulatory approval is obtained for such product 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase is attributable primarily to higher depreciation and operating costs for development work in the company s newly acquired facility  and to a lesser extent  labor and supplies as a result of an increase in the number of employees  and costs to prepare and file product license applications 
these increases were offset in part by lower clinical testing and related expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million in as compared to million in approximately million of this increase is due to the combined effect of the recognition of non cash compensation expense in the amount of approximately million  related to the extension of the term of one expiring stock option  and to a one time technology license fee payment 
the remaining increase is attributable to higher labor costs as a result of an increase in salaries and the number of employees  as well as professional service costs 
in the first quarter of  the company sold  shares of its investment in common stock of ivax corporation ivax  which generated proceeds of approximately million  and a realized gain of million

the increase in labor cost is attributable primarily to an increase in number of employees 
in addition  facility costs increased in over due to the company s placing in service its expanded production facility and its adjacent support facility 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in these expenses in is due primarily to depreciation expenses related to the acquisition of a new manufacturing facility  and to a lesser extent  an increase in clinical testing and related expenses as the number of clinical trials sponsored by the company increased and as the company expanded its clinical and regulatory affairs operations

liquidity and capital resources the company s cash requirement for operations was million in the fourth quarter of and million for the year ended december  the company s cash requirement for operations is defined as the net cash used in operating activities for the period being reported less amounts received under marketing  research and development agreements and further adjusted by the timing of proceeds from the sale of investments in affiliates 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and investment securities in an affiliate with a market value of  the investment consisted of  shares of ivax common stock 
the fair market value as of march  was approximately million 
this investment is volatile and therefore subject to significant fluctuations in value 
the company anticipates that cash requirements for operations in the first quarter of could be between approximately and million as the company produces its acellular pertussis vaccine for commercial sale in europe  produces certiva tm in anticipation of regulatory approval in the united states and other territories  produces investigational combination vaccines and conjugate vaccines  and conducts clinical trials 
quarterly cash requirements for operations beyond these periods will depend principally upon the level and efficiency of vaccine production  the timing of fda approval for certiva tm  level of sales of certiva tm in the us  level of product sales in europe as additional approvals are obtained  costs to market certiva tm following approval  the level of expenditures for the company s ongoing research and development program  and the timing of interest payments due on the convertible subordinated notes described above 
if the company does not secure fda licensure and generate commercial sales of certiva tm  the company will need to address its future cash requirements for operations 
this issue may be addressed through reductions in operating levels and through the sale of debt or equity securities  among other means as more fully described below 
there are no assurances that the company will be successful  under these circumstances  in significantly reducing operating levels or in placing debt or equity securities on favorable terms or in an amount required to meet its future cash requirements for operations 
the foregoing are forward looking statements 
there are no assurances that the company will meet the projections for cash requirements for operations  that any further regulatory approvals will be received  that the milestones under existing marketing and research and development agreements will be achieved  or that  if such milestones are obtained  they will contribute materially to the quarterly cash requirements 
failure or significant delays in receiving additional regulatory approvals and meeting milestones would have a significant adverse effect on the company s future financial position 
total capital expenditures for were million 
the company is in the planning stages of expanding its manufacturing capacity for its vaccine products for both clinical trials and for commercial sale 
total projected capital expenditures for for facilities modifications  equipment  systems and other capital additions could range between million to million  depending upon the ultimate extent of the expansions  which has not yet been determined 
the foregoing is a forward looking statement  and the amount of and timing for capital expenditures could fluctuate based upon a number of factors including  without limitation the magnitude of the changes in the facilities required to meet demand for the company s acellular pertussis products  the equipment and leasehold improvements required in order to expand the company s production capacity for investigational products  the anticipated timing for further regulatory approvals of existing products  the anticipated timing for regulatory approval of future products  and unanticipated costs to replace or repair existing equipment and systems in order to keep the manufacturing and development facilities operational or in compliance with regulatory requirements 
the capital expenditures described above are exclusive of any future real estate acquisition or build out plans 
the company continues to evaluate its need to build out  lease or acquire additional research  development  and other facilities to accommodate the company s expanding vaccine development program 
the company reached a preliminary understanding with a real estate investment trust to lease an approximately  square foot facility for a period of ten years  with two five year renewal options 
the initial base annual rent under the lease would be approximately  with minimum annual escalations 
at the end of the fifth year of the initial term  the company would have the right to terminate the lease for a specified fee 
in addition  the company would have an option to purchase the facility during specified periods of the lease term 
the trust would provide the company with an allowance of approximately million for tenant improvements  and would make available to the company a line of credit of up to approximately million to fund any additional improvements in excess of the tenant improvement allowance 
monthly payments under this line of credit would consist of interest only accruing at the simple annual rate of  and the entire unpaid principal balance would mature in september  unless extended by the company up to march the line of credit also would be secured by all leasehold improvements and related facility enhancements purchased with funds provided by the trust 
the negotiation of these agreements is substantially completed and these agreements may be executed in the near future 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to negotiate successfully and sign a definitive lease for the facility or the attendant line of credit  or that if these documents are executed  the financial terms thereof will not be materially different 
the lease payments and operating costs for this facility are included in  and not in addition to  the anticipated cash requirements for operations described above 
the company currently anticipates that capital expenditures of approximately million would be required to modify the facility to accommodate the company s operations 
additional capital expenditures for this or other facilities may vary substantially depending upon a number of factors including  among other things  the size of such facilities  the equipment and systems requirements for the facilities  location  zoning and other government restrictions and the magnitude of available financing 
as noted above  the company is obligated to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants under an equipment lease agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition of a  square foot manufacturing facility 
these financial covenants include maintaining minimum cash and investment balances  minimum tangible net worth  and compliance with prescribed financial ratios 
the company may at any time  and intends during the first or second quarter of to  eliminate these financial covenants by posting a letter of credit for a predetermined amount 
the amount of the letter of credit would be approximately million as of march  and would be secured by a cash deposit of an equal amount 
in the absence of posting this letter of credit  a breach of the financial covenants would result in the company being obligated to post such letter of credit 
cash requirements for operations and capital expenditures for are expected to be financed through a combination of cash and cash equivalents  fees and payments from existing and or new license  marketing  distribution and or development agreements  the exercise of stock options  the sale of debt and or equity securities  mortgage financing  lines of credit  and equipment leases 
the company currently has no agreements or understandings regarding any of the debt or equity financing options 
the company believes that it has adequate cash resources to meet its funding requirements although there are no assurances in this regard 
failure or significant delays in receiving additional regulatory approvals and satisfying milestones would have a significant adverse effect on the company s future operating results and future financial position 
the company believes that in such event it would reduce cash requirements for operations through significant reductions in operating levels  although there are no assurances that the company would be successful in this regard 
this paragraph contains forward looking statements and the factors affecting the ability of the company to meet its funding requirements and manage its cash resources include  among other things the timing of fda approval for certiva tm  the efficiency of the company s production operations  the sales price for products established by the company and its distributors  the magnitude and timing of product sales  the magnitude and timing of any fees and payments from license  marketing  distribution and or development agreements  the magnitude of fixed costs  and the capital expenditures required to operate and expand existing and future facilities 
outlook the company recognized an operating loss of million in based on revenues of million from product sales  million from collaborative milestone and license payments  and million under a development agreement 
the company expects to incur an operating loss of between and million in the first quarter of  which is approximately equal to the operating loss incurred in the last quarter of thereafter  the company anticipates that the quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly based upon a number of factors including  among other things the magnitude of product sales for distribution in europe  the timing of fda marketing clearance for certiva tm  the timing for the commercial introduction of certiva tm  the ability of the company and its distributors to compete against competitive products  several of which have been approved  and to effectively market and sell products in their respective territories  the sales prices established for products by the company and its distributors  the efficiency of the company s production operations  the timing of the payments under license  marketing  distribution and or development agreements with third parties  the ability of the company to manufacture and deliver products in accordance with customer orders  the timing and costs associated with clinical trials and post licensure testing of the company s products  the timing and amount of funding that may be received under any additional license  marketing  distribution and or development agreements with third parties  and the timing of and amount of proceeds from the sale of additional investment securities 
the backlog of orders believed to be firm for the company s acellular pertussis vaccine was approximately million as of december  the company does not consider orders for any of the company s products to be firm until such time as regulatory approval is obtained for each such product 
to date  the company has manufactured certiva tm in anticipation of fda approval and has expensed all related production expenses 
there are no assurances that the fda will allow or permit the company to sell all or any portion of the vaccine produced and failure to receive permission to sell a significant portion of the product could have a material adverse affect on the future results of operations of the company 
the foregoing are forward looking statements and the factors affecting its outcome are described elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  including the first paragraph hereof  and in the risk factors and other information contained in this form k and other filings with the sec  to which the reader s attention is directed 
the quarterly operating results may also be affected by the quantity of product produced for sale since the production expenses have been mainly fixed and consist primarily of costs to operate the production facilities  to scale up production and to maintain a ready work force 
to date  the company has limited experience and success in manufacturing commercial quantities of its vaccine products and in operating its manufacturing facilities 
from time to time  the company experiences disruptions and production failures and there are no assurances that the steps taken by the company to address such failures will be effective or that such failures will not continue in the future 
such disruptions or failures would have a material adverse effect on the company s future operating results and could affect the company s ability to obtain regulatory approval for its products or the timing of such approval 
no assurances can be given that the company will be successful in establishing and maintaining consistent and continuous commercial production of its vaccines in sufficient quantity and quality or that it will be capable of producing a competitively priced product for commercial sale 
the company s manufacturing operations for certiva tm are located principally in one facility 
any condition or event that adversely affects the condition or operation of such facility would have a material adverse affect on the company s financial condition and future results of operations 
in addition  given its size and configuration  such facility has limited production capacity 
accordingly  there are no assurances that the company will be able to produce sufficient quantities of vaccine to meet market demand or achieve profitability 
there are no assurances that the company will meet the operating results projected  that any further regulatory approvals will be received  that any milestones will be achieved  or if achieved  that milestone payments will contribute materially to the quarterly operating results of the company 
product sales 
the company anticipates additional revenues from product sales during to european distributors for sale and distribution in select european countries 
as of december   the company s backlog of orders believed to be firm are approximately million 
any additional product approvals in europe could lead to increased revenues from the sale of the company s acellular pertussis vaccine 
there are no assurances that further product approvals will be obtained in europe during or at all  or that once obtained the company s european distributors will launch the products in a timely manner or at all  or that if launched  that the distributors will be effective in the marketing and distributing the products 
the company does not control the marketing and distribution efforts of such distributors in their respective territories and  therefore  the company s revenues for product sales in those territories are dependent upon the timing  implementation  and effectiveness of these parties sales  marketing and distribution efforts 
additionally  although the fda export reform and enhancement act permits a company to export vaccines manufactured in the united states with little or no prior fda review and approval  the fda retains the authority and ability to delay  suspend or terminate a manufacturer s ability to commence or continue such efforts 
this authority may be exercised if the fda finds the product fails to meet prescribed standards relating to manufacturing  labeling  and promotional activities  among others 
there are no assurances that the fda will not  at any time or from time to time  seek to delay  defer or suspend the company s export activities for failure to meet any of the prescribed standards of the statute 
any such action could have a material adverse affect on the future results of operations 
as described above  during  the company and abbott signed an agreement under which abbott would market certiva tm and certain combination vaccines to private physicians and managed care markets in the united states for immunization of infants and children 
the company will market these products to government purchasers  including state governments and the cdc 
fda approval of the company s product license application for certiva tm is pending 
in january  the company was advised by the fda that certiva tm is on track for completing the final steps for licensure 
the company has prepared and submitted additional information to the fda in furtherance of its license application 
following fda approval  the company  therefore  anticipates revenues during the second or third quarter of from the sale of certiva tm in the united states to state governments and the cdc  and to abbott for resale to private physicians and the managed care market 
if the product is launched successfully in the united states by the company and abbott  revenues from operations and the prospects for profitability would increase 
the foregoing are forward looking statements  and there are no assurances that the company will achieve profitability based solely on revenues from its acellular pertussis vaccine or any future vaccines under development 
there can be no assurance that the fda s approval will be obtained or that  once obtained  product revenues will be generated in the time frame projected  or that the company and or abbott will be effective in marketing and distributing the product 
the principal factors affecting the approval of certiva tm and its timing are believed to be the adequacy of the most recent information submitted  the timeliness of the fda completing its entire review process  the sufficiency of the clinical trials design  the quality of the clinical data submitted to the fda  and the adequacy of the systems  procedures  operations and facilities relating to the product  among other things 
the factors affecting successful commercial launch of certiva tm in the united states include  among others successfully participating in established purchasing programs of federal and state governments  establishing an identity and reputation for the company and its products  creating an awareness among pediatricians of the safety and efficacy of the vaccine  distinguishing the company s product from that of its competitors  establishing the company as an effective and reliable supplier of vaccines  establishing efficient and consistent production of sufficient quantities of vaccine and establishing effective distribution channels 
the foregoing paragraphs contain only a partial description of the factors affecting the company s business prospects and risk factors affecting future operations 
reference is made to the risk factors and other information contained in this form k  as well as the company s other filings with the sec  for a more complete description of the risks and uncertainties affecting the company and its business 
marketing  research development agreements 
in december  the company signed a clinical development agreement and license agreement with pasteur merieux connaught under which the parties agreed to jointly develop its new conjugate vaccine against group b meningococcal infection for both adults and pediatric indications 
in  the company recognized revenue from pasteur merieux connaught under these agreements  and in the third quarter of  the company received a million milestone payment under this collaboration 
future fees and funding would be made upon achievement of development  clinical and regulatory milestones 
total remaining fees and payments to the company upon achievement of all clinical and regulatory milestones amount to million 
the time it may take to achieve future milestones cannot be predicted accurately  and there are no assurances that any additional milestones will be met 
in addition  pasteur merieux connaught may terminate these agreements in its sole discretion at any time 
under the marketing and distribution agreement with abbott  the company will receive clinical development payments and milestone payments upon achievement of prescribed clinical and regulatory events 
total remaining payments by abbott to the company under the agreement amount to million 
in addition  the company will receive revenues from abbott as it purchases certiva tm and the combination vaccine products for resale to the private pediatric market 
there are no assurances that the milestones will be met  that the quantities of abbott s purchases of certiva tm will be significant or as to the timing of such purchases  or that abbott will not exercise its right to terminate this arrangement at any time with advance notice 
in  the company anticipates that total receipts of license fees  clinical development funding and milestone payments under its existing marketing  research and development agreements could be approximately million 
this is a forward looking statement and the factors that affect the timing of the license fee and milestone payments are in large measure outside of the control of the company 
in  the company recognized million of revenue under marketing  research and development agreements  which includes the million received under the agreements with pasteur merieux connaught 
the revenue recognized by the company from clinical development payments received from abbott are and will be equal to the company s expenditures in the clinical development program for certiva tm and the combination vaccines up to a specified amount 
accordingly  such revenues are likely to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and would have no effect on net operating results 
the factors that affect the timing of these expenditures  and therefore  the revenues to be recognized therefrom  are subject to uncertainties related to the planning  commencement and completion of clinical trials and the regulatory approval process 
there are no assurances that the clinical development funding from abbott will be sufficient to fund all of the company s expenditures in the clinical development program for certiva tm and the combination vaccines 
the company is considering executing further distribution agreements for certain markets throughout the world
