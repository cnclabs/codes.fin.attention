overview during the fiscal year ended june   the company expanded its nursing home operations with two additional facilities  formed and began operating three healthcare joint venture companies  and initiated plans to acquire five additional nursing homes  which plans were announced in august in the previous fiscal year the company had reorganized its capital structure and completed an initial public stock offering the offering which raised net proceeds of approximately million 
in connection with the offering  the company acquired two businesses in the healthcare field  balz and prn 
the company believes that the demand for long term care and specialty medical services will increase substantially over the next decade due primarily to favorable demographic trends  advances in medical technology and emphasis on healthcare cost containment 
at the same time  government restrictions and high construction and start up costs are expected to limit the supply of long term care facilities 
in addition  the company anticipates that recent trends toward industry consolidation will continue and will provide future acquisition opportunities 
the company s operating strategy is to increase nursing home profitability levels  through aggressive marketing and by offering rehabilitation therapies and other specialized services  adhere to strict cost standards at the facility level while providing effective patient care and containing corporate overhead expenses  and become a fully integrated health network whereby the company will increase marketing of medical products and supplies  rehabilitative services  institutional pharmaceutical services and nursing services to affiliated and non affiliated nursing homes and hospitals  as well as patients at home 
by concentrating its facilities and ancillary service operations within a selected geographic region  the company s strategy is to achieve operating efficiencies through economies of scale  reduced corporate overhead  more effective management supervision and financial controls 
in addition  the company believes that geographic concentration also enhances the company s ability to establish more effective relationships with referral sources and regulatory authorities in the states where the company operates 
year disclosure the company is working to resolve the potential impact of the year on the ability of the company s computerized information systems to accurately process information that may be date sensitive 
any of the company s programs that recognize a date using as the year rather than the year could result in errors or system failures 
the company utilizes a number of computer programs across its entire operation 
the company has not completed its assessment  but currently believes that costs of addressing this issue will not have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position 
however  if the company and third parties upon which it relies are unable to address this issue in a timely manner  it could result in a material financial risk to the company 
in order to assure that this does not occur  the company plans to devote all resources required to resolve any significant year issues in a timely manner
