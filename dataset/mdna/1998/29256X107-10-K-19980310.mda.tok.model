the change in operating expenses would have been for the years to and for the years to  without these charges

the company began to incur costs to develop novastan r during the third quarter of these costs will continue during because of ongoing novastan r trials and will continue to be significant through the fda approval process and as clinical trial work for additional clinical indications is performed 
the company also began incurring clinical trial costs in for the compounds tbc and tbc in  the company expects to begin to incur costs for clinical trials related to additional compounds

there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such additional financings on acceptable terms or in time to fund any necessary or desirable expenditures 
in the event such financing is not obtained  the company s drug discovery or development programs may be delayed  scaled back or eliminated

hazardous materials and environmental matters the company s research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous and radioactive materials 
the company is subject to federal  state  and local laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of such materials and certain waste products 
management believes that the company is in compliance with such laws  regulations and standards currently in effect and that the cost of compliance with such laws  regulations  and standards will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company does not expect to incur any material capital expenditures for environmental control in the foreseeable future 
impact of inflation and changing prices the pharmaceutical research industry is labor intensive  and wages and related expenses increase in inflationary periods 
the lease of space and related building services for the houston facility contains a clause that escalates rent and related services each year based on the increase in building operating costs and the increase in the houston consumer price index  respectively 
to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on the operations of the company
