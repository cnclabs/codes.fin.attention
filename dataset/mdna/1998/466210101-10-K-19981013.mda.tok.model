gross profit  as a percent of sales  decreased to in from in the major contributors to this decrease were the effects of increased sales discounts related to increasingly competitive market conditions and unfavorable currency effects due to the strength of the us dollar 
these reductions were partially offset by lower product costs as a result of cost reductions 
gross profit  as a percent of sales  decreased to in from in the decrease was due to a shift in product mix to smaller  less profitable models  product pricing pressures  and product introduction costs 
selling  general and product development expenses decreased  in compared to an increase of million in and  as a percent of sales  were for compared to for and for  the decrease in dollars was primarily attributable to reduced personnel related costs and consulting expenses 
partially offsetting these reductions were higher product development costs in support of new and redesigned products 
the dollar increase for principally reflected higher personnel and related costs  increased expenses associated with expanding foreign operations  and increased consulting expenses 
for  miscellaneous expense was primarily comprised of currency conversion losses of  partially offset by higher investment income 
for  miscellaneous expense included  in currency conversion losses compared to  in gains for the effective income tax rates were  and for  and  respectively 
the decreases in the effective income tax rate are primarily due to tax benefits related to the increasing level of export sales and a lower state income tax expense 
financial condition the company continues to maintain a strong financial position  with the funding of capital projects and working capital needs principally out of operating cash flow and cash reserves  while remaining virtually debt free 
working capital increased by million in and million in  principally due to increased cash and higher receivable balances associated with extended payment terms dictated by competitive pressures in the marketplace and a higher percent of international sales which typically have longer payment terms 
supplementing its working capital at july   the company had unused credit lines totaling million 
the company considers these resources  coupled with cash expected to be generated by operations  adequate to meet its foreseeable funding needs for anticipated expenditures  including higher inventory levels to support shorter delivery requirements  million for additional equipment held for rental and million for other capital related projects

future results of operations  financial condition and liquidity may be affected to the extent that the company s ultimate exposure with respect to product liability varies from current estimates 
outlook this outlook section and other parts of this management s discussion and analysis and accompanying annual report contain forward looking information and involve risks and uncertainties that could significantly impact expected results 
certain important factors that  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s results of operations and that could cause such future results of operations to differ are described in cautionary statements pursuant to the securities litigation reform act which is an exhibit to this report

year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
these programs treat years as occurring between and the end of and do not self convert to reflect the upcoming change in the century 
if not corrected  computer applications could fail or create erroneous results by or at the year the company has undertaken a program to understand the nature and extent of the work required to make its systems year compliant 
this program encompasses information systems  shop floor equipment and facilities systems  the company s products and the readiness of the company s suppliers and customers 
the program includes the following phases identification and assessment  compliance plan development  remediation and testing  production implementation and contingency plan development for critical areas 
the company s objective is to become year compliant with its critical activities and systems by december   allowing substantial time for further testing  verification and conversion of less important activities and systems 
the company has determined that it has no exposure to contingencies related to the year issue for products it has sold and that its information technology systems are substantially year compliant 
testing of the information systems is scheduled to be completed prior to december  the company is also requesting assurances by no later than december  from its significant suppliers and customers that they are addressing this issue to ensure that there will be no major disruptions to the company s business 
the total cost of the year project to date has not been material 
based on its program to date  the company does not expect that future costs of modifications will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
because the company expects that its internal systems will become year compliant in a timely manner  the company believes that the most reasonably likely worst case year scenario would result from suppliers or other third parties failing to achieve year compliance 
depending upon the number of third parties  their identity and the nature of the non compliance  the year issue could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
however  the company will develop contingency plans  which should be complete in early  should any critical problems occur in any of the assessment areas noted above 
accordingly  the company does not expect year problems to result in any material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
foreign currency risk the company manufactures its products in the united states and sells these products in that market as well as international markets  principally europe and australia 
as a result of the sales of its products in foreign markets  the company s financial results are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies 
based on a sensitivity analysis performed at july   the company has estimated that a strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which the company s sales are denominated would result in a decrease in operating income of approximately million for the year ended july  the company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices 
euro conversion on january   certain countries of the european union are scheduled to establish fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and one common currency  the euro 
the euro will then trade on currency exchanges and may be used in business transactions 
beginning in january  new euro denominated currencies will be issued and the existing currencies will be withdrawn from circulation 
the company is currently evaluating the systems and business issues raised by the euro conversion 
these issues include the need to adapt computer and other business systems and equipment and the competitive impact of cross border transparency 
the company has not yet completed its estimate of the potential impact likely to be caused by the euro conversion  however  at present the company has no reason to believe the euro conversion will have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations
