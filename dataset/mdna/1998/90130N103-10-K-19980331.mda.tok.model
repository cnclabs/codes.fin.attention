the overall increase in assigned risk units was an expected response to new legislation 
homeowner and condominium 
units in force for the company s homeowner and condominium programs declined by from december  to december   of which occurred in the first quarter of this was primarily due to a requirement by the california department of insurance that the company non renew homeowner and condominium policies from july  until february  at that time  the company began offering renewal of policies for approximately  homeowner insurance customers 
these renewals were subject to an overall rate increase on april  as of december   more than  policies had been renewed which is of those eligible 
the company continues to seek approval to resume writing new homeowner policies  however  unless the company is granted such permission  the impact of this line on future underwriting results is likely to remain insignificant

for  the impact of relatively dry weather  a continued strong decline in claim frequencies and severities and the attraction and retention of a higher percentage of more profitable  preferred customers all contributed to the improvement in underwriting results 
the decrease in gross premiums written reflects the increase in insured units coupled with the effect of the premium rate reduction implemented in and the impact of rate reductions which were fully felt in gross premiums written in decreased from reflective of the reduction in insured units and  to a lesser extent  the effect of the three premium rate reductions implemented in a total reduction of 
while a growth in business generally indicates the need for an increase in incurred but not reported ibnr reserves  favorable development in older case reserves and the lower frequency and severity of new claims have resulted in the company making a smaller provision for ibnr reserves in than in and the voluntary automobile insurance business written by the company is comprised of good drivers as defined by california statute 
while the majority of this business would have been acceptable to the company before proposition  those who had no prior insurance would have been written at a higher rate level than those who had been insured prior to being written by the company 
these drivers have produced automobile underwriting losses of  in compared to  in and  in the sharp decline in losses in is reflective primarily of favorable loss trends  despite the increase in vehicles in force of over the previous year 
the combined ratio for this segment of the business was compared to in and in as part of the new rating plan that became effective october   changes were implemented that the company expects will bring the combined ratio for this class of policyholders more into line with the rest of the company s voluntary book of business 
overall automobile underwriting results are also affected by assigned risk 
underwriting losses for assigned risk business were  in  compared to  in and  in combined ratios for this business for the same periods were  and  respectively 
the decrease in underwriting losses in was reflective of an improved loss ratio despite a increase in vehicles in force since  which is believed to have been fueled by strengthened legal sanctions aimed at reducing the number of uninsured motorists in california 
the decrease in underwriting losses in was primarily due to a drop in vehicles in force since coupled with the effects of a rate increase implemented in june the future effect of the assigned risk plan on the company cannot be predicted because it depends on the ability of the state administered plan to achieve and maintain an adequate rate level 
homeowner and condominium excluding earthquake and proposition settlement underwriting results for these programs are subject to variability caused by weather related claims and by infrequent disasters 
in and  no significant losses were incurred 
since july   the company has maintained reinsurance programs to provide coverage for its remaining homeowner policies as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company had previously maintained separate catastrophe coverage on these lines which expired in june written premiums ceded in totaled million compared to million in excluding the million portfolio transfer of unearned premium liabilities under the quota share reinsurance agreement  and million in personal excess liability the personal excess liability program has remained stable over the three year period ended december   producing approximately million in gross written premiums each year 
underwriting profits can vary significantly with the number of claims which occur infrequently 
earthquake and proposition although the company did not write new or renewal earthquake premiums in through  the company assumes a small amount of earthquake premium from the california fair plan  a state administered pool of difficult to insure risks in which insurers are required to participate in proportion to their share of direct written homeowners coverage in the state 
the negative premiums earned for the earthquake and proposition in is due to million of reinsurance purchased to protect the company until the earthquake endorsements expired in july policy acquisition and general operating expenses the company s policy acquisition and general operating expense ratio continues to be among the most competitive in the industry 
the ratio of underwriting expenses excluding interest and fees to earned premiums was in  in and in the increase in the expense ratios from to is mainly due to the decline in premiums earned as well as an increase in marketing expenses 
impact of year what is commonly referred to in the financial press as the year issue has arisen because some computer programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  these systems and programs may not calculate dates beyond  which may cause errors or systems failures 
the company has begun a project to modify the applicable portions of its software so that its computer systems will properly calculate dates beyond the total year project cost is estimated to be approximately million  which will be expensed as incurred 
in  the company incurred and expensed approximately million  and substantially all of the remaining costs are expected to be incurred in this project is planned for completion in the first quarter of  which provides sufficient time to avoid any adverse impact on the company s operating systems 
investment income net pre tax investment income was  in compared to  in and  in average invested assets decreased in  compared to decreases of and in and  respectively 
the decline in invested assets resulted from the decline in net earned premiums and the sale of investments to meet the payment requirements of both developing earthquake losses and reinsurance premiums 
the average annual pre tax yield on invested assets was in  in and in realized capital gains on the sales of investments have declined over the past three years  as underwriting cashflow has increased and the need to sell investments to cover claim payments and other operating needs has decreased commensurately 
as of december   the company had a pre tax unrealized gain on fixed maturity investments of  compared to  in and  in interest rates fell in and which increased the fair value of the bond portfolio for those years 
the decrease in unrealized gains between and resulted largely from a declining bond market coupled with an overall decline in invested assets 
at december    of the company s total investments at fair value was invested in tax exempt bonds with the balance representing of the portfolio  invested in taxable securities 
liquidity and capital resources loss and loss adjustment expense payments are the most significant cash flow requirements of the company 
the company continually monitors loss payments to provide projections of future cash requirements 
additional cash requirements include servicing the bank debt and paying dividends as approved from time to time by the company s board of directors 
with the anticipated growth of its core auto business and continued settlement of remaining earthquake losses  the company expects that future cash flows from operations will continue to be sufficient to fund future expenditures 
the company has historically written its core business at an underwriting profit and thus each premium dollar generates a positive cash flow 
a significant part of the decline and subsequent increase in cash flow from operations in and  respectively  is due to the fall and rise  respectively  in the size of the net book of business during these periods 
in approximately million of the million net decrease in cash and cash equivalents was related to the portfolio transfer of unearned premiums on homeowners business 
cash flows from operations in were not sufficient to fund underwriting operations of the company due to losses from the northridge earthquake 
for  funds needed to pay these claims  as well as proposition rebates  came from normal operating cash flows  available cash on deposit  additional loan proceeds of million and preferred stock proceeds of million 
funds required by th century industries to pay dividends and meet its debt obligations are provided by the insurance subsidiaries 
information regarding the company s debt service obligation is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the ability of the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to the holding company is regulated by state law 
based on the operating results in and the favorable ratio of premiums to surplus  the company was able to resume normal dividends from the insurance subsidiaries in to service the parent s debt and dividend requirements 
based upon operating results and earned surplus as of december   the company believes it will not require regulatory approval in for any extraordinary dividends 
the company expects to have very small cash outlays for income taxes  specifically alternative minimum tax  for the next two to three years 
until the net operating losses caused by the northridge earthquake are fully utilized  the company expects that cash outlays for income taxes will be less than income tax expense recorded in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the net operating loss carryforwards will expire in the year the company in embarked on a major project to upgrade its technological infrastructure and to conform certain of its procedures to industry best practices 
although the ultimate cost of this project is not yet determinable  management believes cash flow from operations as well as expected improvements in operational efficiencies will be more than adequate to fund the project s implementation which is expected to take place over the next several years 
risk based capital the national association of insurance commissioners requires property and casualty insurance companies to calculate and report information under a risk based capital rbc formula in their annual statements 
the rbc requirements are intended to assist regulators in identifying inadequately capitalized companies 
the rbc calculation is based on the type and mix of risks inherent in the company s business and includes components for underwriting  asset  interest rate and other risks 
the company s insurance subsidiaries exceeded their rbc statutory surplus standards by a considerable margin as of december  to the extent that a subsidiary would fall below prescribed levels of surplus  it would be the parent company s intention to infuse necessary capital to support that entity
