the company s actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors including  but not limited to  those set forth under factors that may affect future results of operations 
general the company is one of the nation s largest publicly traded managed health care companies with approximately million medical members and approximately million specialty members as of december  the company offers a diversified mix of managed care products  including health maintenance organizations hmos  preferred provider organizations ppos  point of service pos plans  other hybrid plans and traditional indemnity products 
in addition  wellpoint offers managed care services for self funded employers under management services contracts  including claims processing  actuarial services  network access  medical cost management and other administrative services 
the company also offers a broad array of specialty and other products  including pharmacy  dental  utilization management  life  integrated workers compensation  preventive care  disability  behavioral health  cobra and flexible benefits account administration 
recent acquisitions and may recapitalization on march   the company completed its acquisition of certain portions of the health and related life group benefits operations the gbo of the john hancock life insurance company 
the purchase price was million  subject to adjustment upon completion of a post closing audit which is still pending 
the purchase method of accounting has been used to account for the acquisition of the gbo 
the gbo  with an associated million acquired members  targets large employers with  or more employees and a majority of the medical members it serves are in health plans that are self funded by employers 
the gbo offers indemnity and ppo plans and also provides life  dental  pharmacy  utilization management and disability coverage to a variety of employer groups 
the gbo has historically experienced a higher administrative expense ratio than the company s traditional california business due to the gbo s higher percentage of management services business 
the higher administrative expense ratio of the gbo has contributed and may continue to contribute to an increase in the company s overall administrative expense ratio in current and future periods 
the company expects to incur approximately to million of costs relating to the gbo acquisition during  a portion of which is expected to be reflected in the company s results of operations 
at the time that the gbo acquisition was consummated  the company expected that it would experience material membership attrition of up to as it integrated the gbo operations and implemented its strategy of motivating traditional indemnity insurance members to select managed care products through  among other things  product design and premium increases 
premium increases implemented in the second and third quarters of did not result in the expected membership attrition 
the company is currently unable to determine if and to what extent the company may experience additional membership attrition as it continues to integrate this acquired business 
on march   the company acquired the life and health benefits management division mmhd of massachusetts mutual life insurance company the mmhd acquisition 
the acquired mmhd operations focus on employers with to  employees and provide administrative services  ppo and indemnity insurance products 
the company has experienced membership attrition of approximately through december  on acquired membership  a portion of which is the result of recently instituted premium increases with respect to certain accounts 
the company expects that it will experience some level of further membership attrition of its acquired mmhd members as it pursues its strategy of motivating members to select managed care products 
on may   the company completed the recapitalization  including the acquisition of the commercial operations of bcc the bcc commercial operations for million in cash 
the recapitalization included the payment of a million special dividend funded by million in revolving debt and the remainder in cash see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the recapitalization 
as a result of the gbo and mmhd acquisitions  the company has significantly expanded its operations outside of california 
in order to implement the company s regional expansion strategy  the company will need to continue its development of satisfactory provider and sales networks and successfully convert these books of business to the company s existing information systems  which will require additional expenditures by the company 
prior to their acquisitions by wellpoint  each of the gbo  mmhd and the bcc commercial operations experienced a higher overall loss ratio than the company 
the inclusion of these acquisitions has contributed to an increase in the company s overall loss ratio 
in order to control the respective loss ratios and reduce the financial risk of these acquired businesses  the company has undertaken a variety of measures  including the imposition of significant premium increases and changes in product design 
the company also implemented a series of price increases for certain of its california managed care businesses in response to an increased loss ratio in the second and third quarters of the company will continue to evaluate the need for further price increases  plan design changes and other appropriate actions in the future 
there can be no assurances  however  that the company will be able to take subsequent pricing or other actions or that any actions previously taken or implemented in the future will be successful in addressing any concerns that may arise with respect to the performance of certain businesses 
legislation a variety of health care reform measures are currently pending or have been recently enacted at the federal  state and local levels 
recent federal legislation seeks  among other things  to insure the portability of health coverage and mandates minimum maternity hospital stays 
these and other proposed measures may have the effect of dramatically altering the regulation of health care and of increasing the company s loss ratio or decrease the affordability of the company s products 
in may  the texas legislature adopted senate bill no 
sb  which purports to make managed care organizations mcos  such as the company  liable for the failure by the mco  its employees or agents to exercise ordinary care when making health care treatment decisions as defined in sb 
the legislation became effective as of september  it is too early to determine what effect  if any  this legislation may have on the company 
however  to the extent that this legislation or similar legislation that may be subsequently adopted at the federal or state level effectively expands the scope of liability of mcos such as the company  it may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition

factors that may affect future results of operations certain statements contained herein  such as statements concerning potential or future loss ratios  expected membership attrition as the company continues to integrate its recently acquired operations and other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts  are forward looking statements as such term is defined in the securities exchange act of 
such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those projected 
factors that can cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and those discussed from time to time in the company s various filings with the securities and exchange commission 
see also item business factors that may affect future results of operations 
as part of the company s business strategy  the company has recently acquired substantial operations in new geographic markets 
these businesses  which include substantial indemnity based insurance operations  have experienced varying profitability or losses in recent periods 
during  the company worked extensively on the integration of these businesses  which will be continuing in  however  there can be no assurances regarding the ultimate success of the company s integration efforts or regarding the ability of the company to maintain or improve the results of operations of these businesses as the company pursues its strategy of motivating the acquired members to select managed care products 
in order to implement this strategy  the company has and will  among other things  need to continue to incur considerable expenditures for provider networks and information systems in addition to the costs associated with the integration of these acquisitions 
the integration of these complex businesses may result in  among other things  temporary increases in claims inventory or other service related issues 
the company s results of operations could be adversely affected in the event that the company experiences such problems or is otherwise unable to implement fully its expansion strategy 
the company s operations are subject to substantial regulation by federal  state and local agencies in all jurisdictions in which the company now operates 
many of these agencies have increased their scrutiny of managed health care companies in recent periods 
future regulatory actions by any such agencies may have a material adverse affect on the company s business 
the company s future results will depend in large part on accurately predicting health care costs and upon the company s ability to control future health care costs through underwriting criteria  utilization management and negotiation of favorable provider contracts 
changes in utilization rates  demographic characteristics  health care practices  provider consolidation  inflation  new technologies  clusters of high cost  the regulatory environment and numerous other factors are beyond the control of any health plan and may adversely affect the company s ability to predict and control health care costs and claims  as well as the company s financial condition or results of operations 
additionally  the company faces competitive pressure to contain premium prices 
fiscal concerns regarding the continued viability of government sponsored programs such as medicare and medicaid may cause decreasing reimbursement rates for these programs 
any limitation on the company s ability to increase or maintain its premium levels  design products  or select underwriting criteria may adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
managed care organizations  both inside and outside california  operate in a highly competitive environment that has undergone significant change in recent periods as a result of business consolidations  new strategic alliances  aggressive marketing practices by competitors and other market pressures 
additional increases in competition could adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
as a result of the company s recent acquisitions  the company now operates on a national basis and offers a spectrum of health care and specialty products through various risk sharing arrangements 
the company s health care products include a variety of managed care offerings as well as traditional fee for service coverage 
with respect to product type  fee for service products are generally less profitable than managed care products 
a critical component of the company s expansion strategy is to transition over time the traditional insurance members of the company s acquired businesses to more managed care products 
with respect to the risk sharing nature of products  managed care products that involve greater potential risk to the company generally tend to be more profitable than those managed care products where the company is able to shift risks to employer groups and management services products 
individuals and small employer groups are more likely to purchase the company s higher risk managed care products because such purchasers are generally unable or unwilling to bear greater liability for health care expenditures 
over the past few years  the company has experienced greater margin erosion in its higher risk managed care products than in its lower risk managed care and management services products
