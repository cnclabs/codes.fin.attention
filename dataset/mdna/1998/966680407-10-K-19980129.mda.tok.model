general in fiscal  and  approximately   and  respectively  of the company s continuing operations sales were directly or indirectly attributable to the united states government 
substantially all of these sales relate to the aerospace segment 
companies engaged in supplying military equipment to the united states government are subject to competition  changes in the continuing availability of congressional appropriations  changes in contract timing and scheduling  complexity of designs and the potential for obsolescence  and other changes which may result from world events 
a loss of government business  although not anticipated by the company  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
financial condition and liquidity on april   in conjunction with the purchase of xyplex  inc  the company amended and increased its bank credit facility and borrowed an additional million under such facility 
at that time the amended credit agreement consisted of an million revolving credit facility with a five year term and an million term loan repayable in quarterly installments over five years 
the cash payment to raytheon company for the purchase of xyplex  inc on april  was million 
at october   the company s debt totaled million  which consisted of million of loans under the revolving credit facility  million under the term loan  million of convertible subordinated debt  and million of other debt 
in addition  there were million of letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
since july   the company has not been in compliance with one or more of the four financial ratio covenants in its credit agreement and  at october   the company was not in compliance with any such covenants 
the company has obtained successive waivers of these defaults 
a waiver agreement dated as of july  required the company to make  in addition to previously scheduled principal payments  principal payments on the term loan by september   in an aggregate amount of not less than million and to pay a fee on november  of million 
in addition  the waiver permitted the company to retain fifty percent of the net cash proceeds from certain asset sales which previously would have been used to repay the term loan 
a waiver dated december   waived the defaults up to but not including january  under the terms of this latest waiver  the interest rate on loans outstanding under the credit agreement is equal to the agent bank s prime rate plus 
there is no assurance that in future periods  the company will be in compliance with any of the financial covenants contained in its credit agreement  or that  after expiration of the current waiver on january   additional waivers of the financial covenants will be obtained and  if obtained  that any such waivers would contain terms which would be as favorable to the company as  or would materially differ from  waivers granted in the past 
consequently  bank debt in the amount of million  which otherwise would have been classified as noncurrent  has been classified as current 
furthermore  acceleration of the debt under the credit agreement by the bank lending group upon the company s failure  after january   to comply with any of the financial ratio covenants would be an event of default under the company s million convertible subordinated note 
because of this possible cross default  the entire million principal balance of the convertible subordinated note has also been classified as current debt 
at october   the company had unused and available credit of million under its revolving credit facility 
the company believes that its existing cash and available credit under its revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet future operating cash needs through the waiver period 
thereafter  the company may need additional financing to meet its operating cash needs 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such additional financing 
debt as a percent of total capitalization stockholders equity plus debt was at october   compared with at october  the current ratio at october  was  compared with at october   while working capital was million at october   compared with million at october  excluding the debt reclassifications discussed above  the current ratio would have been and working capital would have been million at october  and at october  the current ratio and working capital would have been and million 
cash flow provided by continuing operations in was million  compared to million in the million increase from to was due primarily to significant non cash charges incurred in totalling million  greater increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in compared to totalling million and greater reductions in accounts receivable  inventories and prepaids and deferred and recoverable income taxes in compared to totalling million 
substantially offsetting these was the net loss in of million compared to net income of million in capital expenditures of continuing operations during were million  compared to million in at october   there were approximately million of approved capital expenditures outstanding for the replacement and upgrade of existing plant and equipment at the various facilities of the company s continuing operations 
funds for these and other capital expenditures are expected to be provided from operations and advances under the credit agreement 
capital expenditure amounts are a component of one of the financial ratio covenants contained in the company s credit agreement 
the company has been evaluating the most advantageous means to realize the value of its acre parcel of land  located in the city of santa clarita  california 
since  the company has undertaken the environmental remediation of this property and related cash expenditures during totalled million 
during the fourth quarter of  in connection with its strategy to reduce debt  the company decided to sell this land and thus recorded a non cash write down of million to state this asset at its estimated fair value 
financial accounting standards board statement no 
fas requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
under the standard  when an impairment write down is required  the related assets are adjusted to their estimated fair value 
for purposes of fas  fair value has been determined to be the amount a willing buyer would pay a willing seller for such assets in a current transaction that is other than a forced or liquidation sale 
the estimation process involved in determining if assets have been impaired and in determining fair value is inherently uncertain since it requires estimates of current market yields as well as future events and conditions 
in determining fair value the company considered  among other things  the range of preliminary purchase prices being discussed with potential buyers and developers as well as estimates of the total cost of environmental remediation 
on february   the company concluded the sale and leaseback of its simi valley facilities 
the net proceeds of million from the sale were used to prepay term debt under the company s credit agreement 
the lease term covers the fifteen year period ending february  and calls for rent escalations of every three years beginning with the fourth year 
on september   the company sold its defense electronics unit and the net proceeds of million from the sale were used to prepay term debt under the company s credit agreement 
as a result primarily of the activities of its discontinued operations  the company is a potentially responsible party in a number of actions filed under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of cercla

impact of year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs or products that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or send invoices  or could result in liability arising from such product failures 
based on a recent assessment  the company has determined that it will be required to modify or replace portions of its software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the company presently believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram or replace and test the software for year modifications 
the company is not able at this time to estimate the cost of the year project or its anticipated completion date and therefore is unable to determine whether or not the year issue will have a material impact on future financial results 
subsequent event on january   the company entered into a definitive agreement to sell all of the common stock of its wholly owned subsidiary  whittaker xyplex  inc  the parent company of xyplex  inc  to mrv communications  inc  for million in cash plus warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock of mrv communications  inc the sale is subject to customary closing conditions  including hart scott rodino act clearance
