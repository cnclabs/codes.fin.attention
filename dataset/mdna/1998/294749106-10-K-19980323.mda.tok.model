item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion provides information on the results of operations for the three years ended december  and the financial condition  liquidity and capital resources as of december  the financial statements and the notes thereto contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with this discussion 
the profitability of the company s operations in any particular accounting period will be directly related to the average realized prices of oil and gas sold  the volume of oil and gas produced and the results of acquisition  development and exploration activities 
the average realized prices of oil and gas will fluctuate from one period to another due to market conditions 
the aggregate amount of oil and gas produced may fluctuate based on development and exploitation of oil and gas reserves and other factors 
production rates  value based production taxes  labor and maintenance expenses are expected to be the principal influences on operating costs 
accordingly  the results of operations of the company may fluctuate from period to period 
oil and gas reserves excluding revisions to previous estimates  drilling and acquisition activities in the united states and canada added million barrels of oil equivalent to the company s proved reserve base  replacing of production 
sharply lower oil prices caused year end downward revisions in the estimates of oil reserves of  barrels 
in total  the company s proved oil and gas reserves inreased over levels 
at year end  proved reserves stood at million barrels of oil and billion cubic feet of natural gas 
using a discount rate and year end oil and gas prices and operating costs as prescribed by the securities and exchange commission  the pre tax net present value of the company s reserves at year end totaled million  compared to million at year end the principal cause of the decline in pre tax values are the lower year end prices in used to estimate oil reserves 
in the company added million barrels of oil equivalent  equal to of oil and gas production 
year end proved reserves of oil were million barrels  an increase of over year end reserves of million barrels 
natural gas proved reserves at year end were billion cubic feet  lower than at year end barrel equivalent reserves of million barrels were higher on a year to year basis 
equity loss and impairment of investment in symskaya exploration  inc 
in  symskaya plugged and abandoned the lemok well  and charged the drilling costs of the well to expense 
due to the uncertainty relating to symskaya s obtaining additional outside financing and proceeding with development of the license area  all other capitalized costs related to the company s investments in and advances to symskaya were also written off  resulting in a total charge to expense of  the company has no current plans to fund future exploratory drilling in russia 
the company s share of symskaya s net loss in was  which resulted primarily from administrative related epenses 
further discussion of this venture is found in item properties  under the caption present activity  and in footnotes and to the financial statements 
adoption of sfas no 
as discussed in note to the financial statements  the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and assets held for disposal  effective july  the adoption of this accounting standard resulted in non cash charges for the impairment of proved oil and gas properties in the amount of   after tax in non cash sfas no 
impairment charges of   after tax and   after tax were recorded during and  respectively 
sfas no 
requires successful efforts companies to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying costs of their proved oil and gas properties at a field level  rather than on a company wide level as previously allowed by the securities and exchange commission 
the sfas no 
test compares the expected undiscounted future net revenues from each producing field with the related net capitalized costs at the end of each period 
when the net capitalized costs exceed the undiscounted future net revenues  the cost of the property is written down to fair value  which is determined using discounted future net revenues from the producing field 
these are non cash financial statement events only 
there has been no decrease in the quantity or expected future net revenue from the company s reserves  nor is there any impact on the company s cash flows 
results of operations comparison of with oil and gas production and sales the company s increases in oil and gas sales are due largely to increases in natural gas production and prices 
during  the company s gas production increased  from bcf in to bcf in average prices of per mcf in were higher than the received in the increase in gas production reflects the ongoing success and rising contribution from the company s exploration and development programs in california and wyoming 
offsetting the increases in gas production and pricing  oil production was essentially flat from year to year  with  barrels produced in  compared to  barrels in while year end oil prices experienced a sharp decline from the prior year  the decline in average prices received throughout the year was somewhat milder 
average prices of per barrel were lower than the per barrel received in further details of production and pricing are found in item properties  under the caption production 
other income during the first half of  the company recorded a gain on the sale of certain oil and gas properties of approximately  the properties sold had reserves of less than  barrels of oil 
there was no corresponding event in in addition  during the third quarter of  the company sold its minority interest in an oil field technology research company 
in connection with the sale  the company recognized a gain of approximately  these two transactions combined to increase other income by over levels 
lease operating costs despite a higher number of wells on production during as compared to  lease operating costs declined on a per unit basis 
the primary factor in the decline was a reduction in value based production taxes 
as of the company s production on a barrel of oil equivalent basis comes from crude oil  the decline in average oil prices in brought about a similar decline in production taxes 
in addition  operating costs associated with natural gas properties are lower on a barrel of oil equivalent basis than for oil producing properties 
the company s ratio of gas to oil production is increasing  and as it does so  per unit costs are likely to decline 
depreciation  depletion  and amortization dd a increased dd a charges in were a direct reflection of lower year end oil prices used in calculating reserves 
generally speaking  as oil prices decline  economic oil reserves also decline 
as these reserves decline  extraction percentages increase  resulting in higher dd a charges 
impairment of proved oil and gas properties as discussed previously  included in the statement of operations for and are non cash charges for the impairment of proved oil and gas properties in the amount of  and  respectively 
equity loss and impairment of investment in symskaya exploration  inc 
as discussed above  in  symskaya plugged and abandoned the lemok well  and charged the drilling costs of the well to expense 
due to the uncertainty relating to symskaya s obtaining additional outside financing and proceeding with development of the license area  all other capitalized costs related to the company s investments in and advances to symskaya were also written off  resulting in a total charge to expense of   after tax 
the company s share of symskaya s net loss in was  which resulted primarily from administrative related epenses 
d seismic and exploration expenses during  the company incurred  in d seismic costs related to its exploration programs  compared to  in exploration expenses increased as the company drilled exploratory dry holes in  compared to dry holes in successful efforts accounting  the method used by the company  requires both d seismic costs and exploratory dry hole costs to be expensed on a current basis 
general and administrative expenses the company recorded increases in compensation expense  along with small increases in other administrative charges during interest expense during  because of its ongoing exploration project in russia  the company was required to capitalize most of its interest expense 
with activity in russia curtailed in  interest is now being charged to expense 
along with increased borrowing on the company s revolving credit facility  this caused interest expense to increase during over levels 
income tax benefit income tax expense for includes additional taxes arising from an audit of the company s canadian tax returns 
the adjustment resulted in the accrual of approximately  in additional canadian taxes related to prior years 
details concerning the components of the tax expense can be found in footnote to the financial statements 
comparison of with oil and gas production and sales the company recorded increases in oil and gas production and sales during  compared to oil production rose  from  barrels in to  barrels in gas production rose  from bcf in to bcf in the production increases were a direct result of the company s successful exploration and development drilling and acquisition programs 
increases in production were augmented by increases in both oil and gas average prices received during the year 
the company s average gas price received during was  up from received during oil prices increased from in to in the combination of increased production and increased prices resulted in an increase of in oil and gas sales for further details of production and pricing are found in item properties  under the caption production 
other income other income in included the recognition of  of lease revenue deferred in there was no similar transaction in this reduction in other income was partially offset by increased overhead fees from operated properties 
lease operating costs lease operating costs increased in over levels 
the increase was directly attributable to the increases in production discussed above  higher value based production taxes associated with increased product prices  and a greater number of wells on production 
was the first full year of operations for the wells drilled and acquired during in addition  the company added approximately wells during depreciation  depletion  and amortization dd a increased dd a charges in were a direct reflection of increased production and the addition of new wells to the company s depletion base 
as discussed above  was the first full year of operations for the wells drilled and acquired during in addition  the company added approximately wells during impairment of proved oil and gas properties as discussed previously  included in the statement of operations for and are non cash charges for the impairment of proved oil and gas properties in the amount of  and  respectively 
the charge resulted from the company s adoption of sfas no 
 effective july  equity loss and impairment of investment in symskaya exploration  inc 
as discussed above  in  symskaya plugged and abandoned the lemok well  and charged the drilling costs of the well to expense 
due to the uncertainty relating to symskaya s obtaining additional outside financing and proceeding with development of the license area  all other capitalized costs related to the company s investments in and advances to symskaya were also written off  resulting in a total charge to expense of   after tax 
d seismic and exploration expenses during  the company incurred  in d seismic costs related to its california exploration programs  compared to  in exploration expenses increased as the company drilled dry holes in  including one dry hole which cost approximately  compared to dry holes in general and administrative expenses the company recorded increases in compensation expense  along with small increases in other administrative charges during interest expense subsequent to the plugging of the lemok  the company discontinued capitalizing interest expense on the investment in symakaya exploration  inc along with increased borrowing on the company s revolving credit facility  this caused interest expense to increase during over levels 
income tax benefit the company s income tax benefit was a function of the loss in details concerning the components of the tax benefit can be found in footnote to the financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents  and temporary cash investments    working capital    cash provided by operating activities    cash used in investing activities    cash provided by financing activities    cash and working capital total cash balances dropped by from  as a result of a combination of several events discussed in the following paragraphs 
working capital decreased by 
the company s ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at december   compared to to at december  the company believes that existing cash balances  cash flow from operating activities  and the remaining borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility will provide adequate resources to meet its capital  exploration  and acquisition spending objectives in cash flow from operating activities cash flow from operating activities declined in compared to levels  primarily as a result of a reduction in accounts payable balances  which is mainly a function of timing 
higher oil and gas sales  which arose from increased oil and gas production and higher product prices  were the principal factors behind an increase in cash flow from operating activities from to cash flows from investing activities capital expenditures in were higher than the amount recorded in included in the figures were million associated with proved property acquisitions  and million associated with unproved property acquisitions 
during  the company recorded costs of million and 
million  respectively  for these property acquisitions 
subsequent to the plugging of the lemok in  the company s advances to symskaya exploration  inc decreased significantly 
during the company advanced approximately  to symskaya  compared to approximately million in the company expects that advances to symskaya in will again be minimal as the company has no current plans to fund any exploratory drilling 
the investment activity was partially funded by proceeds from the sale of properties in  and by the sale of temporary cash investments in both years 
capital expenditures increased over levels 
funds advanced to symskaya exploration increased from  in to  in  an increase of 
cash flows from financing activities in march of  the company obtained a million borrowing base credit facility the facility  with an initial commitment of million 
the company used proceeds of   and  in  and respectively  from the facility to fund capital expenditures  retire its previous outstanding note payable in the amount of  and for working capital purposes
