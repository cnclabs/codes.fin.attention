cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p the companies cinergy  a delaware corporation  is a registered holding company under the public utility holding company act of puhca 
cinergy was created in the october merger of psi resources  inc and the cincinnati gas electric company cg e 
cinergy is the parent holding company of psi energy  inc psi  cg e  cinergy investments  inc investments  and cinergy services  inc 
services 
cg e is an operating utility primarily engaged in providing electric and gas service in the southwestern portion of ohio and through its principal subsidiary  the union light  heat and power company ulh p  in adjacent areas in kentucky 
psi is an operating utility primarily engaged in providing electric service in north central  central  and southern indiana 
services provides management  financial  administrative  engineering  legal  and other services to cinergy  cg e  psi  and investments 
cinergy conducts its international and non regulated businesses through investments and its subsidiaries 
financial condition competitive pressures electric utility industry cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p introduction the electric utility industry is transitioning from a monopoly cost of service regulated environment to an industry in which companies will ultimately compete to be the customers energy provider 
this transition will continue to impact the operations  structure  and profitability of cinergy 
the effects of competition are already being felt in the wholesale power markets  where the increased numbers of power marketers and brokers are reducing the margins previously experienced 
energy companies are positioning themselves for full competition through mergers and acquisitions  strategic alliances with other energy companies and energy related businesses  and through the development of new products and services 
just as critical to cinergy will be the regulatory outcome of the deregulation process in each of its three franchise states  as well as the outcome in other states where cinergy plans to compete 
deregulation process the ferc opened up the wholesale electric markets to competition in with orders and the final rules provided for mandatory filing of open access comparability transmission tariffs  provided for functional unbundling of all services  required utilities to use the filed tariffs for their own bulk power transactions  established an electronic bulletin board for transmission availability and pricing information  and established a contract based approach to recover any potential stranded investments explained below as a result of customer choice at the wholesale level 
customer choice at the end user ie  retail level currently remains under the jurisdiction of individual states see state developments 
the deregulation process has varied greatly from state to state 
several states have enacted customer choice legislation  while many states are in the early stages of studying the issues 
during the process of developing customer choice legislation  utilities have been required to consider issues such as the recovery of any stranded investment  ability to compete for incumbent customers  and the potential forced divestiture of generating assets 
cinergy continues to be an advocate of competition in the electric utility industry and continues to pursue customer choice legislation at both the state and federal levels 
as the deregulation process has progressed  it has become clear that both scale and diversity of business are critical factors for success 
scale is critical for several reasons 
a critical mass of customers allows the development of new products and back office capabilities in a cost effective manner 
a larger balance sheet scale and diversity of commodities ie  gas and electric allow the trading business to market risk intermediation products without taking excessive financial risks and to recover back office costs in a low margin business 
merger and acquisition activity in the energy industry appears to be accelerating as companies attempt to create the desired scale 
recent developments stranded investments due to excess capacity in the industry and the declining cost of new technology  electricity prices in a competitive market may not fully cover the costs of past commitments made by utilities while under a cost of service regulated environment 
fixed costs which cannot be recovered through electricity sales at market prices are referred to as stranded investments 
while the recovery of prudent past investments and commitments has been supported by ferc in order and at least partially in the states in which competition related legislation has been passed  there is no guarantee that cinergy or any other utility will receive full recovery of potential stranded investments 
in addition  in those states which have legislated open competition  many have required the divestiture of generating assets in order to qualify and obtain recovery of stranded investments 
midwest iso during  cinergy collaborated with other midwestern utility companies on a plan to join the transmission systems of the participating companies into a single regional system 
the plan was filed with the ferc early in for approval 
if approved  the new system would be managed independently by an independent system operator iso 
the formation of a midwest iso  as it has become known  would ensure non discriminatory open transmission access and system reliability  as well as the development of a regional transmission tariff  which would help eliminate the pancaking of transmission rates in a region 
currently  there are eight utilities participating in the filing along with cinergy 
the proposed iso consists of  miles of transmission lines and covers portions of eight midwestern states  forming one of the largest isos in the country 
ferc s approval of the plan is anticipated to come within a year 
repeal of the puhca currently  puhca creates a number of restrictions that make preparing for deregulation more difficult 
puhca restricts the amount which can be invested outside the regulated utility  including foreign investments and investments in power plants 
it also restricts potential merger partners to those that meet certain integration requirements 
in  the sec endorsed recommendations for reform of puhca 
the recommendations called for repeal and  pending repeal  significant administrative reform of the year old statute 
since the release of the sec s report  numerous bills have been introduced in both houses of the united states us congress providing for the repeal or significant amendment of puhca 
during  a bill repealing puhca was introduced in the us senate but was never brought to a vote 
legislation repealing puhca is anticipated to be reintroduced in the us congress in cinergy supports the repeal of this act either as part of comprehensive reform of the electric industry or as separate legislation 
franchise rights during  several states enacted transition plans that included a variety of measures designed to create a level playing field for new competitors 
in some cases  there has been a mandatory divestiture of existing customers 
in others  the plans provide incentives which may encourage customers to switch suppliers by providing above market credits to those who switch from the incumbent utility 
also  some states have put varying restrictions on the incumbent utility s ability to compete for these customers 
cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p state developments as previously mentioned  certain states have enacted legislation which will lead to complete retail competition within the next several years 
these states generally have required up front rate reductions and the opportunity for all customer classes to choose an electricity provider 
a few states have phased in customer choice  but still provided for immediate rate reductions 
all states passing legislation have included some mechanism for recovery of stranded investment 
however  states have varied on the methodology to be applied in determining the level of stranded investment  and divestiture of generation assets has been required in a few states 
as discussed below  the three states in which cinergy operates public utility companies have all had legislation introduced which would provide for full retail customer choice 
none of these states has yet passed legislation  but policymakers and stakeholders continue to work to resolve issues with an eye toward passage 
cinergy and psi indiana a customer choice bill sb was introduced during the indiana legislative session  with support from a coalition made up of cinergy  the indiana manufacturers association  the indiana industrial energy consumers  inc  and one other indiana investor owned electric utility 
after amendments were made  essentially stripping the bill of most of its provisions and turning it into a bill calling for the study of deregulation by a legislative committee known as the regulatory flexibility committee study committee  sb passed the legislature and was signed by the governor 
the indiana utility regulatory commission iurc issued a report titled energy report public policy considerations report to the study committee in november the scope and purpose of the report was to provide information to the study committee which would enable them to answer the question of whether retail customer choice was in the best interest of indiana 
public policy issues listed by the report for the study committee to consider were jurisdiction over retail transmission  recovery of stranded investments  estimation methodology of any stranded investments allowed to be recovered  method for recovery of stranded investments  low income and environmental programs  and impact of deregulation on state and local taxes 
the report s conclusion was in the long run  competition in the electricity market could be in the best interest of indiana 
experience in other states has shown that the best outcomes and smoothest process to bring about customer choice in the electric industry have resulted from a cooperative effort led by the governor  the legislature and the state commission working together with all stakeholders 
indiana should be prepared to respond to competition created by other states  especially those surrounding indiana  and to any federal legislation that requires nationwide competition in the electricity market 
as a result of the iurc report and other testimony to the study committee  the study committee recommended that they continue to study changes in the electric industry 
another customer choice bill sb  sponsored by  among others  those who supported the customer choice bill during  was introduced in the indiana senate in january in the house of representatives  house bill hb was introduced 
this bill calls for a study by the iurc of the effects deregulation would have on indiana 
although the legislature is much more knowledgeable on the customer choice issues as a result of the study committee s report and debating the customer choice bill  neither sb or hb was passed during the legislative session 
cinergy and cg e ohio although the ohio legislature did not pass customer choice legislation during  it did create the joint select committee on electric industry deregulation committee to examine competition and restructuring issues 
the committee heard testimony from a variety of stakeholders on various customer choice issues throughout the spring of in december  the committee s chairpersons unveiled the outline of a plan designed to bring competition into ohio s retail electric industry in the year the chairpersons plan is based on five basic policies all customers  including residential  can participate from the outset  the cost of electricity will decrease from the outset and continue to decrease at an accelerating rate for all customers during the transition period  current low income assistance programs will be continued  current reliability and quality of service will be maintained  and open free markets will be established with lower prices driven by competition 
the plan would provide for competition among utilities to begin january   with a five year transition period 
furthermore  the plan addresses the tax consequences of a deregulated environment through the creation of a revenue neutral system 
the current tax structure of ohio subjects ohio electric utility companies to certain state taxes which would not be paid by out of state competitors selling power in ohio retail markets 
the new system attempts to remedy this disadvantage while not diminishing the amount of tax revenues currently being collected by state and local governments 
the chairpersons were not able to get their plan adopted by the full committee 
some of the primary concerns that have been expressed are that the plan does not adequately address utilities stranded investment concerns  and that the proposal to create retail marketing areas  or buying pools  throughout the state during the transition period would be unduly disruptive in that customers who did not affirmatively elect to remain with their incumbent utility would be assigned to the buying pool under a public utility commission of ohio puco designed and administered bidding process 
the chairpersons have announced intentions to introduce a bill in also in ohio  a bill was introduced in november hb authorizing the issuance of electric utility rate reduction bonds that would permit utilities to securitize certain assets 
the bill itself does not provide for retail competition but  rather  specifies financing issues a utility may engage in to prepare for competition 
it is uncertain whether this bill or any bill providing for retail competition will be passed in ohio in cinergy  cg e and ulh p kentucky in january  the house chairman of the tourism  development and energy committee introduced a customer choice bill hb 
the bill would allow persons and businesses in participating service areas to choose their supplier of electricity beginning january  it would also ensure a rate cap to prevent any increase in generation energy prices for six years  with certain exceptions 
because of its low electric rates  kentucky has not to date been moving aggressively toward retail customer choice 
it is uncertain whether hb will be passed in kentucky in cinergy united kingdom transition to full competition in the united kingdom s uk electric utility industry began with the industry s privatization in when the industry was privatized  the generation  transmission  and regional distribution businesses were  in effect  unbundled into separate companies 
the regional distribution companies  including midlands electricity plc midlands cinergy  through a joint venture owns a interest in midlands  see note e of the notes to financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data  own no transmission facilities and are limited as to the amount of generation they may own 
third party access to the transmission and local distribution systems was also put in place  enabling licensed suppliers to use these networks 
as a result of the transition plan  larger users of electricity have been free to choose their supplier since or earlier 
full competition for all customers was scheduled to be phased in beginning in april however  due to delays with the design and testing of information systems  the phase in to full competition has been delayed to september midlands service territory is now scheduled to begin open competition in october to date  new entrants to the industry have been limited to independent power producers  who compete with the formerly state run generators by using new  efficient technology 
there have been no major new entrants into the supply business from outside the industry 
however  new entrants are expected to emerge as full competition opens 
a substantial portion of midlands operating profit is related to the distribution business  which will remain a regulated monopoly 
midlands intends to market both gas and electric service in the supply business  as all customers gain the ability to choose suppliers 
cinergy  cg e  and ulh p gas utility industry customer choice the puco approved cg e s gas customer choice program during the plan  which made customer choice available to all residential and small commercial customers  went into effect in november as of january   approximately  customers have opted to participate in this program 
large industrial  commercial  and educational institution customers already had the ability to select their own gas supplier 
in  the puco approved two other gas customer choice programs in the state 
cinergy resources  inc cri  cinergy s gas retail marketing subsidiary  is one of many entities competing for customer gas supply business in these programs 
cg e continues to provide the gas transportation service for all customers on its system without regard to the supplier of the gas commodity 
cg e receives a transportation charge from customers which is based on its current regulated rates 
cinergy and cg e loss of transportation customer late in  ak steel  cinergy s largest natural gas transportation customer  informed cg e that it plans to build its own pipeline to connect directly to an interstate natural gas pipeline 
the interruptible contract with cg e  which represents approximately million of annual revenues  will expire at the end of under that contract  ak steel purchases gas directly from other suppliers but uses cg e s pipelines to deliver the gas 
ak steel is able to pursue this alternative because of its close proximity to an existing interstate pipeline 
with few customers being similarly situated  cinergy and cg e do not currently anticipate others proceeding in a similar manner 
cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p cinergy s response to the changing competitive environment cinergy believes competition will benefit electric customers individually and the economy as a whole 
cinergy has taken steps to prepare not only for the changing environment  but to assure fairness and consistency in the setting of rules and regulations in the various markets in which cinergy competes 
cinergy s basic approach to the deregulation environment is to have set a goal to be a top five utility in five measures of scale and productivity within five years 
examples of steps taken to achieve this goal include the following cinergy reorganized its operations into four strategic business units 
this functional unbundling separated cinergy s business into energy services  energy delivery  energy commodities  and international business units 
each business unit is responsible for business expansion in its own markets 
cinergy enhanced its international presence in by acquiring its interest in midlands  an electricity distribution company located in the uk 
in  cinergy furthered its international development plans by acquiring the development team and all rights to future projects of midlands power international  a power development subsidiary of midlands 
cinergy formed a joint venture with trigen energy corporation trigen to develop and operate cogeneration and trigeneration facilities throughout the us and canada which enables cinergy to compete for customers outside its own franchise territory prior to and following the arrival of retail competition 
cinergy has partnered with two other energy companies to form cadence network llc which will provide a variety of innovative products and services to multi site national accounts customers 
these services include consolidated billing  bill auditing  and rate and usage analysis 
cinergy has become a major participant in the marketing of power  resulting in megawatt mw sales volume increases of and in and  respectively 
in  cinergy acquired greenwich energy partners greenwich 
greenwich is a small proprietary trader of energy commodities 
through its acquisition of greenwich  cinergy became the first utility company to hold a seat on the new york mercantile exchange nymex 
the nymex is the world s largest physical commodity futures exchange and preeminent trading forum for energy and precious metals 
in  the nymex began trading electricity futures and options contracts with contract delivery points in the western us 
during the first half of  the nymex will begin trading contracts with delivery points located in the midwest  mid atlantic  and southern regions of the country 
cinergy s transmission system was selected as the delivery point for the midwest region 
cinergy s acquisition of the nymex seat and its selection as a delivery point for electricity futures trading demonstrates cinergy s participation as a leader in the evolving power markets 
cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p substantial accounting implications historically  regulated utilities have applied the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation statement 
the accounting afforded regulated utilities in statement is based on the fundamental premise that rates authorized by regulators allow recovery of a utility s costs in its generation  transmission  and distribution operations 
these principles have allowed the deferral of costs ie  regulatory assets based on assurances of a regulator as to the future recoverability of the costs in rates charged to customers 
certain criteria must be met for the continued application of the provisions of statement  including regulated rates designed to recover the specific utility s costs 
failure to satisfy the criteria in statement would eliminate the basis for recognition of regulatory assets 
based on cinergy s current regulatory orders and the regulatory environment in which it currently operates  the recognition of its regulatory assets as of december   is fully supported 
however  in light of recent trends in customer choice legislation  the potential for future losses resulting from discontinuance of statement does exist 
such potential losses  if any  cannot be determined until such time as a legislated plan has been approved by each state in which cinergy operates a franchise territory 
cinergy intends to continue its pursuit of competitive strategies which mitigate the potential impact of these issues on the financial condition of the company

regulatory matters cinergy and psi indiana iurc orders psi s retail rate proceeding and demand side management dsm proceeding in september  the iurc issued an order september order approving an overall average retail rate increase for psi of million annually 
among other things  the iurc authorized the inclusion in rates of the costs of a mw clean coal power generating facility located at wabash river generating station clean coal project and the costs of a scrubber at gibson generating station 
the order also reflects a return on common equity of  before the basis points additional common equity return allowed as a merger savings sharing mechanism in the iurc s february order february order discussed further herein  with an overall rate of return on net original cost rate base 
in october  the office of the utility consumer counselor ucc and the citizens action coalition of indiana  inc cac filed a joint petition for reconsideration and rehearing of the september order with the iurc 
a settlement agreement with the ucc and cac was approved in its entirety by the iurc in august this settlement agreement reduced the original rate increase by million 
major provisions of the settlement agreement include a a million increase in the annual amortization of certain regulatory assets  b a retail rate reduction of million annually  c a 
million reduction in retail rates to reflect an august   cut off date for costs to achieve merger savings instead of an october   cut off date  and d authorization to defer for subsequent recovery costs to achieve merger savings incurred between september   and october  a settlement agreement between psi and certain intervenors  in a proceeding established to review psi s current and proposed dsm programs  was approved by the iurc in december december dsm order 
beginning january   and continuing through december   the settlement agreement allows psi to recover million per year through a non bypassable charge in psi s retail rates 
the million is designed to recover all previously incurred  but as yet unrecovered  dsm costs and all costs related to satisfying remaining commitments associated with a previous dsm settlement agreement 
the million also includes recovery of carrying costs 
further  the agreement authorizes psi to spend up to million annually on ongoing dsm programs through the year and to collect such amounts currently in retail rates 
february order retail rate proceeding and merger savings allocation plan the iurc s february order approved a settlement among psi and certain intervenors authorizing psi to increase retail rates million before credits to base rates of million in and an additional million and million in and  respectively  to reflect the sharing with customers of non fuel operation and maintenance expense merger savings non fuel merger savings 
additionally  the february order provided psi an opportunity to earn up to an additional basis points above the common equity return authorized in the september order until december  to be eligible for such additional earnings  psi had to meet certain performance related standards 
psi met those standards  which were measured in conjunction with quarterly fuel adjustment clause filings 
beginning january   the basis point increment to the authorized common equity return will be phased out over a twelve month period 
effective with this order  psi began recovering carrying costs on certain environmental related projects under construction 
this recovery continues until the date of an approved rate order reflecting such projects in rates 
through this mechanism  revenues were increased by million  million  and million on an annual basis in february  march  and january  respectively 
coal contract buyout costs in august  psi entered into a coal supply agreement with eagle coal company eagle for the supply of approximately three million tons of coal per year 
the agreement  which terminates december   provides for a buyout fee of million including interest to be included in the price of coal to psi over the term of the contract 
this fee represents the costs to eagle of the buyout of the coal supply agreement between psi and exxon coal and minerals company 
the retail jurisdictional portion of the buyout charge  excluding the portion applicable to joint owners  is being recovered through the quarterly fuel adjustment clause  with carrying costs on unrecovered amounts  through december psi has also filed a petition at the ferc for recovery of the wholesale jurisdictional portion of the buyout costs through the wholesale fuel adjustment clause 
generally  the ferc will allow recovery if the utility can demonstrate there will be net benefits to customers during the buyout cost recovery period 
the ferc is expected to issue an order on psi s petition early in see note i of the notes to financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data 
cinergy and cg e ohio puco order cg e s gas rate proceeding in december  the puco issued an order december order approving an overall average increase in gas revenues for cg e of million annually 
the puco established an overall rate of return of  including a return on common equity of 
in developing this return on common equity  the puco considered  among other things  cg e s efforts to reduce costs and increase operating efficiency and its proposals to allow residential customers to choose their natural gas supplier 
the puco disallowed certain of cg e s requests  including the requested working capital allowance  recovery of certain capitalized information systems development costs  and certain merger related costs 
these disallowances resulted in a pretax charge to earnings during the fourth quarter of of million million net of taxes or 
per share basic  
per share diluted 
cg e s request for a rehearing on the disallowed information systems costs and other aspects of the order was denied 
in april  cg e filed a notice of appeal with the supreme court of ohio challenging the disallowance of information systems costs and the imputation of certain revenues 
cinergy and cg e cannot predict what action the supreme court of ohio may take with respect to this appeal 
other in april  the puco issued an order approving a settlement agreement among cg e and certain intervenors which  among other things  resolved outstanding issues related to the merger 
as part of this settlement  cg e agreed to a moratorium on increases in base electric rates until january  except under certain circumstances 
in return  cg e is allowed to retain all puco electric jurisdictional non fuel merger savings until consistent with the provisions of the settlement agreement and the december order  cg e expensed merger transaction costs and costs to achieve merger savings merger costs applicable to its puco jurisdiction of million and million including million as a result of the december order in and  respectively 
cg e and its utility subsidiaries have deferred a portion of the merger costs incurred through december   for future recovery in customer rates 
additionally  in december  the puco issued an order applicable to cg e s dsm programs 
the order requires cg e to spend up to one half of the annual million currently included in retail rates on puco sanctioned low income residential programs 
the remaining portion of the million is to be applied to the recovery of dsm cost deferrals 
cg e s participation in the low income programs will be a factor considered by the puco in setting future rates of return and approving competitive transition plans 
cinergy  cg e  and ulh p kentucky in exchange for the kentucky public service commission s kpsc support of the merger  in may  ulh p accepted the kpsc s request for an electric rate moratorium commencing after ulh p s next retail rate case which has not yet been filed and extending to january  in addition  the kpsc has authorized concurrent recovery of costs related to various dsm programs of ulh p 
ulh p has deferred its portion of merger costs incurred through december   for future recovery in customer rates 
kpsc order in july  the kpsc issued an order authorizing a decrease in ulh p s electric rates of approximately million annually to reflect a reduction in the cost of electricity purchased from cg e 
cinergy  cg e  and ulh p potential divestiture of gas operations under the puhca  the divestiture of cg e s gas operations may be required 
the key question under the relevant puhca standards is the amount of increased operating costs  if any  that would result from the gas operations being divested and operated on a stand alone basis 
in its order approving the merger  the sec reserved judgment over cinergy s ownership of cg e s gas operations for three years  at the end of which period cinergy would be required to address the matter 
in february  cinergy made a filing with the sec setting forth its rationale for retention of the gas operations 
the filing includes  among other things  a study showing that  if divested and operated on a stand alone basis  the gas operations would bear significant increased operating costs  greater than those cited by the sec in two cases permitting electric registered holding companies to acquire and retain gas properties 
for these and other reasons stated in cinergy s filing  cinergy believes its retention of cg e s gas properties meets all relevant standards under the puhca 
environmental issues cinergy  cg e  and psi clean air act amendments of caaa the revisions to the clean air act require reductions in both sulfur dioxide so and nitrogen oxide nox emissions from utility sources 
reductions of these emissions are to be accomplished in two phases 
compliance under phase i was required by january   and phase ii compliance is required by january  to achieve the so reduction objectives of the caaa  emission allowances have been allocated by the us environmental protection agency epa to affected sources eg  cinergy s electric generating units 
each allowance permits one ton of so emissions 
the caaa allows compliance to be achieved on a national level  which provides companies the option to achieve this compliance by reducing emissions and or purchasing emission allowances 
cinergy s operating strategy for phase i was based upon the compliance plans developed by psi and cg e and approved by the iurc and the puco  respectively 
all required modifications to cinergy s generating units to implement the compliance plans were completed prior to january  to comply with phase ii so emission requirements  cinergy s current strategy includes a combination of switching to lower sulfur coal blends and utilizing an emission allowance banking strategy 
this cost effective strategy will allow cinergy to meet phase ii so reduction requirements while maintaining optimal flexibility to meet changes in output due to increased customer choice  as well as potentially significant future environmental requirements 
cinergy intends to utilize an emission allowance banking strategy to the extent a viable emission allowance market exists 
however  the availability and economic value of emission allowances over the long term is still uncertain 
in the event the market price for emission allowances or lower sulfur coal increases substantially from the current forecast  cinergy could be forced to consider high capital cost options 
to meet nox reductions required by phase ii  cinergy may install additional low nox burners on certain affected units in addition to the use of a system wide nox emission averaging strategy 
cinergy is forecasting caaa compliance capital expenditures of million during the through period 
of these forecasted expenditures  million relates to cg e and million relates to psi 
these expenditures are included in the amounts provided in the capital requirements section herein 
in addition  operating costs may increase due to higher fuel costs eg  higher quality  lower sulfur coal  increased use of natural gas and maintenance expenses 
ambient air standards the epa recently revised the national ambient air quality standards for ozone and fine particulate matter 
these new rules increase the pressure for additional emissions reductions 
on september   cinergy announced a proposal to reduce its nox emissions rate by two thirds to pounds of nox per one million british thermal units mmbtu 
at that time  cinergy s preliminary cost estimate for the two thirds reduction was between million and million stated in dollars 
subsequent to cinergy s announcement  the epa announced on october   its proposed call for revisions to state implementation plans sips for statewide reductions in nox emissions  proposing utility nox emissions at a rate of pounds per mmbtu 
the epa s schedule calls for all reductions to be in place as early as these initiatives will force significant reductions in nox emissions from many sources 
the epa has stated that electric utility generating facilities specifically are targeted 
the final total level of nox reductions will depend upon the outcome of the sip revision process 
cinergy estimates that the capital costs for additional nox controls at its facilities at the pounds of nox per mmbtu rate proposed by the epa could exceed million stated in dollars over the next five years depending upon the final level of reductions  details of a nox trading program  and the time frame for implementation 
in february  cinergy joined with various utilities  labor groups  and other organizations from several midwest  great lakes  mid atlantic  and southeast states in forming the alliance for constructive air policy acap 
this coalition is committed to working with policymakers to find cost effective  equitable approaches for reducing ozone pollution in key regions of the country 
the acap is developing an alternative to the epa s proposed call for sips revisions to reduce nox emissions see discussion above 
the acap s proposal is a two step process to achieve reductions in nox emissions 
the first step involves nox emission reductions of percent from levels  or a reduction in the nox emission rate to pounds of nox per mmbtu  whichever is less stringent  by the second step involves the development of enhanced subregional air quality modeling that would be used to determine if any additional reductions are necessary to reach local attainment 
these additional reductions  if needed  would be implemented by the acap is also promoting the establishment of a subregional trading market for nox emissions 
this system would allow for a market based approach to limiting emissions and would produce cost savings and incentives for the development of new technologies to improve air quality 
capital costs required for cinergy to be in compliance under the acap s proposals would be significantly less than those under the current epa proposal 
but as stated above  final costs of compliance depend on the final level of reductions required  details of a nox trading program  and the time frame for implementation and compliance 
the impact of the particulate standards cannot be determined at this time 
the epa estimates it will take up to five years to collect sufficient ambient air monitoring data 
the states will then determine the sources of these particulates and determine a reduction strategy 
the ultimate effect of the new standard could be requirements for newer and cleaner technologies and additional controls on conventional particulates and or reductions in so and nox emissions from utility sources 
since these studies and determinations have not been made  cinergy cannot predict the outcome or effect of the new particulate standards 
global climate change on december   delegates to the united nations climate summit in japan adopted a landmark environmental treaty kyoto protocol to deal with global warming 
the kyoto protocol establishes legally binding greenhouse gas emission targets for developed nations 
the kyoto protocol framework lacks details related to definitions  implementation  and enforcement plans 
for the kyoto protocol to enter into force within the us it will have to be ratified by a two thirds vote of the us senate 
in july  the us senate passed a resolution advising the clinton administration that they would not favorably consider a protocol which did not include commitments for all nations of the world  or that would cause harm to the us economy 
the kyoto protocol  in its present form  is unlikely to be ratified by the us senate since it does not meet the requirements of this resolution 
significant uncertainty exists concerning the science of climate change  and the clinton administration s environmental and energy policies and how it intends to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
cinergy s plan for managing the potential risk and uncertainty of climate change includes implementing cost effective greenhouse gas emission reduction and offsetting activities  encouraging the use of alternative fuels for transportation vehicles a major source of greenhouse gases  funding research of more efficient and alternative electric generating technologies  funding research to better understand the causes and consequences of climate change  and encouraging a global discussion of the issues and how best to manage them 
cinergy believes that voluntary programs  such as the us department of energy climate challenge program  which cinergy joined in  are the most cost effective means to limit greenhouse gas emissions 
air toxics the air toxics provisions of the caaa exempted fossil fueled steam utility plants from mandatory reduction of air toxics until the epa completed a study 
the final report issued in february  confirmed utility air toxic emissions pose little risk to public health 
it stated mercury is the pollutant with the greatest potential threat  while others require further study 
a mercury study report issued in december  stated that mercury is not a risk to the average american and expressed uncertainty whether reductions in current domestic sources would reduce human mercury exposure 
us utilities are a large domestic source  but they are negligible compared to global mercury emissions 
the epa was unable to show a feasible mercury control technology for coal fired utilities 
the epa must determine the need for regulation by april  if more air toxics regulations are issued  the compliance cost could be significant 
cinergy cannot predict the outcome or effects of the epa s determination 
cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p other as more fully discussed in note b ii of the notes to financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data  psi has received claims from indiana gas company  inc igc and northern indiana public service company nipsco that psi is a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act with respect to certain manufactured gas plant mgp sites  and therefore responsible for the costs of investigating and remediating these sites 
in august  nipsco filed suit against psi seeking recovery from psi of nipsco s past and future costs of investigating and remediating mgp related contamination at the goshen  indiana  mgp site 
nipsco alleged that it has already incurred about  in response costs at the site and that remediation of the site will cost about million 
psi denied liability in its answer to the complaint 
the parties are currently engaged in the discovery process and the case has not yet been scheduled for trial 
also  in august  psi reached an agreement with igc settling igc s claims that psi should contribute to igc s response costs related to of the mgp sites conveyed by psi to igc in this agreement requires psi and igc to share past and future response costs equally at the sites 
further  the parties must jointly approve future management of the sites and the decision to spend additional funds 
the settlement does not address five sites psi acquired from nipsco and subsequently sold to igc 
it is premature  at this time  to predict the nature  extent  and ultimate costs of  or psi s responsibility for  environmental investigations and remediations at mgp sites owned or previously owned by psi or its predecessors 
psi continues to gather information pertaining to each of these mgp sites  including the sites which are the subject of the agreement with igc and the goshen site which is the subject of nipsco s complaint 
reserves recorded  based on information currently available  are not material to cinergy s financial condition or results of operations 
however  as further investigation and remediation activities are undertaken at these sites  the potential liability for mgp sites could be material to cinergy s financial condition or results of operations

capital requirements construction and other investing activities cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p construction expenditures for the cinergy system are forecasted to be approximately million for  and over the next five years  are forecasted to aggregate approximately billion 
of these projected expenditures  approximately million and million relate to cg e including million and million for ulh p and million and million relate to psi  for  and over the next five years  respectively 
substantially all of these expenditures are for capital improvements to and expansion of cinergy s operating facilities 
cinergy is forecasting no investments in new generating facilities under the belief that excess supply in the market will continue in the near term 
if deregulation of the generation component of the electric utility industry does not occur in the manner or in the time frame anticipated  and depending on capacity constraints  franchise demand requirements  and the regulatory requirements dictated for integrated resource planning  cinergy could be forced to make capital investments in new generating facilities in lieu of relying upon the existing market for its energy needs 
all forecasted amounts are in nominal dollars  exclude capital costs for additional nox controls at cinergy s facilities see ambient air standards in the environmental issues section herein  and reflect assumptions as to the economy  capital markets  construction programs  legislative and regulatory actions  frequency and timing of rate increases  and other related factors  all or any of which may change significantly

cinergy windfall profits tax during the third quarter of  a windfall profits tax was levied against midlands 
cinergy s share of the tax to be paid by midlands in two equal installments  due december   and  is approximately million pounds sterling million or 
per share  basic and diluted 
midlands borrowed the funds to finance the first installment 
cinergy expects midlands will borrow funds as necessary to pay the final installment 
as cinergy s management believes this charge to be unusual in nature  and does not expect such a charge to recur  the tax was recorded as an extraordinary item in cinergy s consolidated statement of income during the third quarter of no related tax benefit was recorded for the charge as the windfall profits tax is not deductible for corporate income tax purposes in the uk  and cinergy expects that benefits  if any  derived for us federal income taxes will not be significant 
cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p year costs cinergy  like most owners of information systems  will be required to modify significant portions of its systems to accommodate requirements brought about by the turn of the century 
during  cinergy incurred costs of approximately million to modify existing computer systems and applications

maintenance or modification costs will be expensed as incurred  while the costs of new software will be capitalized and amortized over the software s useful life 
capital resources cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p cinergy  cg e and its subsidiaries including ulh p  and psi forecast that their need for external funds during the through period will primarily be for the refinancing of existing securities 
this forecast reflects nominal dollars and assumptions as to the economy  capital markets  construction programs  legislative and regulatory actions  frequency and timing of rate increases  and other related factors  all or any of which may change significantly 
internal funds cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p general currently  the majority of cinergy s revenues and corresponding cash flows are derived from cost of service regulated operations 
cinergy believes it is likely that the generation component of the electric utility industry will ultimately be deregulated 
however  the timing and nature of the deregulation and restructuring of the industry is uncertain 
in the interim  revenues provided by cost of service regulated operations are anticipated to continue as the primary source of funds for cinergy 
as a result of its low cost position and market strategy  over the long term  cinergy believes it will be successful in a more competitive environment 
however  as the industry becomes more competitive  future cash flows from cinergy s operations could be subject to a higher degree of volatility than under the present regulatory structure 
cinergy for the year ended december   cinergy s cash provided from operating activities was million compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in was primarily due to cg e s and ulh p s sales of accounts receivable during the decrease was offset  in part  by psi s payment in of million in accordance with a settlement agreement between psi and wabash valley power association  inc wvpa

the forward looking information and statements presented are only estimates of what may occur in the future  assuming certain adverse market conditions  due to their dependence on model characteristics and assumptions 
as a result  actual future results may differ materially from those presented 
these disclosures are not precise indicators of expected future losses  rather they merely present indications of reasonably possible losses 
energy commodities sensitivity cinergy  cg e  and psi during cinergy functionally reorganized its operations into four strategic business units  including an energy commodities business unit 
the energy commodities business unit includes cinergy s power marketing and trading function  which was formally established in and was the natural successor of cg e s and psi s existing bulk power operations 
at present  the competitive electric power market is dominated by a small number of large participants primarily utilities and a few power marketers  trading liquidity is limited  and pricing is not transparent 
however  similar to the development of natural gas markets  the market for trading electricity is expected to develop rapidly and cinergy plans to be a major participant 
the transactions associated with cinergy s power marketing and trading function give rise to various risks  including market risk 
market risk represents the potential risk of loss from changes in the market value of a particular commitment arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
cinergy s power marketing and trading operations are actively conducted in all regions of the us 
these operations subject cinergy to the risks and volatilities associated with the energy commodities eg  primarily electricity which it markets and trades 
the wholesale power marketing and trading business continues to be very competitive and  as a result  margins have declined throughout the year 
as cinergy continues to develop and expand its power marketing and trading business and due to its substantial investment in generating assets  its exposure to movements in the price of electricity and other energy commodities will become greater 
as a result  cinergy may be subject to increased earnings volatility 
cinergy s power marketing and trading activities principally consist of marketing and trading over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity 
the majority of these contracts commit cinergy to purchase or sell electricity at fixed prices in the future ie  fixed price forward purchase and sales contracts 
cinergy also markets and trades over the counter option contracts 
the majority of these forward and option contracts require settlement by physical delivery of electricity or are netted out in accordance with industry trading standards 
the use of these types of physical commodity instruments is designed to allow cinergy to manage and hedge its contractual commitments  reduce its exposure relative to the volatility of cash market prices  and take advantage of selected arbitrage opportunities 
the use of derivative commodity instruments intended to be settled in cash was not significant during cinergy values its portfolio of over the counter forward and option contracts using the aggregate lower of cost or market method 
to the extent there are estimated net aggregate losses in the portfolio  cinergy reserves for such losses 
as these contracts are settled  actual gains and losses may differ from the estimated gains and losses utilized in calculating the aggregate lower of cost or market reserve due to changing market conditions 
cinergy structures and modifies its net position to capture expected changes in future demand  seasonal market pricing characteristics  overall market sentiment  and price relationships between different time periods and trading regions 
therefore  at times  cinergy creates a net open position or allows a net open position to continue when it believes future changes in prices and market conditions will make the positions profitable 
position imbalances may also occur because of the basic lack of liquidity in the wholesale power market itself 
to the extent net open positions exist  cinergy is exposed to the risk that fluctuating market prices of electric power may potentially impact its financial condition or results of operations adversely if prices do not move in the manner or direction expected 
cinergy measures the risk inherent in its portfolio utilizing value at risk analysis and other methodologies  which simulate forward price curves in electric power markets to quantify estimates of the magnitude and probability of potential future losses related to open contract positions 
cinergy s value at risk expresses the potential loss in fair value of its forward contract and option position over a particular period of time  with a specified likelihood of occurrence  due to an adverse market movement 
cinergy reports value at risk as a percentage of its earnings  based on a confidence interval  utilizing one day holding periods 
on a one day basis as of december   cinergy s value at risk for its power marketing and trading activities was less than of cinergy s income before interest and other charges 
the value at risk model uses the variance covariance statistical modeling technique and historical volatilities and correlations over the past day period 
the estimated market prices used to value these transactions for value at risk purposes reflect the use of established pricing models and various factors including quotations from exchanges and over the counter markets  price volatility factors  the time value of money  and location differentials 
cinergy cinergy capital trading  inc cc t  a subsidiary of investments  specializing in energy risk management  marketing  and proprietary arbitrage trading  actively trades derivative commodity instruments  customarily settled in cash  including futures  forwards  swaps  and options 
cri also utilizes derivative commodity instruments  customarily settled in cash  to hedge purchases and sales of natural gas 
the trading and hedging activities of cc t and the hedging activities of cri were not significant to cinergy s financial condition or results of operations 
cinergy  cg e  psi  and ulh p credit risk represents the risk of loss which would occur as a result of nonperformance by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations with the company 
concentrations of credit risk relate to significant customers or counterparties  or groups of customers or counterparties  possessing similar economic or industry characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions 
concentration of credit risk with respect to cinergy s trade accounts receivable from electric and gas retail customers is limited due to cinergy s large number of customers and diversified customer base of residential  commercial  and industrial customers 
sales for resale customers on cinergy s electric system include traditional electric cooperatives and municipalities with which cg e and psi have long standing relationships 
contracts for sales of electricity for resale outside of cinergy s system are principally with power marketers  other investor owned utilities  electric cooperatives  and municipalities 
as of december   approximately of cinergy s power marketing and trading activity represents commitments with counterparties 
the majority of these contracts are for terms of one year or less 
as the competitive electric power market expands  counterparties will increasingly include new market entrants  such as other power marketers  brokers  and commodities traders 
this increased level of new market entrants  as well as competitive pressures on the utility market participants  could increase cinergy s exposure to credit risk 
as of december   cinergy s management believes nonperformance of contractual obligations by any one counterparty of cinergy s power marketing and trading function would not result in losses which are significant to the financial condition or results of operations of cinergy 
cinergy  cg e  and psi cinergy s energy commodities business unit has established a risk management function and has implemented active risk management policies and procedures to manage and minimize its exposure to price risks and associated volatilities  other market risks  and credit risk 
cinergy maintains credit policies with regard to its counterparties in order to manage and minimize its exposure to credit risk 
these policies include requiring parent company guaranties and various forms of collateral under certain circumstances and the use of mutual netting closeout agreements 
cinergy manages  on a portfolio basis  the market risks inherent in its power marketing and trading transactions subject to parameters established by cinergy s risk policy committee 
market risks are monitored by the risk management group of cinergy s energy commodities business unit  which operates separately from the units which originate or actively manage the market risk exposures  to ensure compliance with cinergy s stated risk management policies and procedures 
these policies and procedures are reviewed and monitored on a continuous basis to ensure their responsiveness to changing market and business conditions

exchange rate sensitivity cinergy cinergy has exposure to fluctuations in the us dollar uk pound sterling exchange rate through its investment in midlands 
cinergy used dollar denominated variable interest rate debt to fund this investment  and has hedged the exchange rate exposure related to this transaction through a currency swap executed in february under the swap  cinergy exchanged million for million pounds sterling 
when the swap terminates in the year  these amounts will be re exchanged  that is  cinergy will be repaid million and will be obligated to repay to the counterparty million pounds sterling 
to fund this repayment  cinergy could buy million pounds sterling in the foreign exchange market at the prevailing spot rate or enter into a new currency swap 
the purpose of this swap is to hedge the value of cinergy s investment in midlands against changes in the dollar sterling exchange rate 
when the pound sterling weakens relative to the dollar  the dollar value of cinergy s investment in midlands as shown on its books declines  however  the value of the swap increases  offsetting the decline in the investment 
the reverse is true when the pound sterling appreciates relative to the dollar 
the translation gains and losses related to the principal exchange on the swap and on cinergy s original investment in midlands are recorded in the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment which is reported as a separate component of common stock equity in the consolidated financial statements 
in connection with this swap  cinergy must pay semi annual interest on its pound sterling obligation and will receive interest on the dollar notional amount 
at december   the fair value of this swap  reflecting the semi annual interest obligations through february  and the final principal exchange  was million 
this was largely offset by a million currency translation gain to date on cinergy s investment in midlands

cinergy  cg e  and psi to manage cinergy s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and to lower funding costs  cinergy constantly evaluates the use of  and has entered into  several interest rate swaps 
under these swaps  cinergy or its subsidiaries agree with counterparties to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated on an agreed notional amount 
this interest differential paid or received is recognized in the consolidated statements of income as a component of interest expense 
through two interest rate swap agreements  cinergy has effectively fixed the interest rate on the pound sterling denominated obligation created by the currency swap discussed above 
each contract requires cinergy to pay semi annually a fixed rate and receive a floating rate through february the combined notional amount of both swaps is million pounds sterling 
translation gains and losses related to cinergy s interest obligation  which is payable in pounds sterling  are recognized as a component of interest expense in the consolidated statements of income 
at december   psi had two interest rate swap agreements outstanding with notional amounts of oo million each 
one contract  with three years remaining of a four year term  requires psi to pay a floating rate and receive a fixed rate 
the second contract  with a six month term  requires psi to pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate 
in both cases  the floating rate is based on applicable libor
