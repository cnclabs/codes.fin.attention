these larger opportunities require longer sales development time than do technical assistance  and the transition to this mode of sales required a significant amount of time and attention from the company s management and key personnel 
the company derives a substantial amount of its revenues from a small number of clients 
accordingly  the timing and amount of integration services performed for these clients has caused the company s service revenues to fluctuate

interest income interest income was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decreases are primarily the result of a decrease in investments  which were used to fund operating activities during liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had no significant capital spending or purchase commitments and had cash and investments totaling  and working capital of  for the years ended december   and the company used   and  respectively of cash for operating activities 
the amount of cash used in operating activities during and decreased as a result of cost reduction efforts 
these cost reductions will reduce the amount of cash that the company anticipates will be required to fund operating activities in the cash provided from investing activities in  and was primarily from investments that matured in those years 
no significant financing activities occurred in  or with the implementation of the cost reduction measures during and  the company believes its existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements into new accounting standards in october  the aicpa s accounting standards executive committee issued statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  which must be adopted by the company effective january  management does not anticipate that the adoption of this sop will have a significant impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
effective at year end  the company will adopt statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information  which requires disclosure of segment data in a manner consistent with that used by an enterprise for internal management reporting and decision making

factors that may affect future results there can be no assurance that the company s business will grow as anticipated or that the company will achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
the company derives a substantial part of its revenues from a small number of clients whom  after evaluating the company s capabilities  decide whether to engage the company to create business case evaluations  consult on change management practices and  in some cases  to design  implement and deploy their mobile computing systems 
a decision by any one of these clients to delay a mobile computing project may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company has decided to focus its efforts in the near term on selling its system integration services to clients in a small number of vertical markets  such as field service 
although the company believes that such specialization will increase its effectiveness  it also means that the company s failure in any one of these areas will have a significant adverse impact on overall company performance 
in order for the company s revenues from consulting and integration services to grow  the company must continue to add more clients and larger projects to plan  design and implement mobile computing systems 
the company s inability to obtain clients for large scale consulting and integration services or the company s inability to leverage its consulting and integration services to obtain additional revenues from its software licenses and network support services could materially and adversely affect the growth of its business 
competition in the mobile computing industry is intense
