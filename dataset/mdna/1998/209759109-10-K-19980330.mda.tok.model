the operating results of the acquired companies subsequent to the acquisition dates are included in the consolidated statements of income 
details of the acquisitions are included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
sales and cost of sales 
net sales increased to a record billion in  compared with net sales of billion and net sales of billion 
record shipments of  tons were an increase of over the previous record year of  which was a increase over gross margin as a percent of sales was  compared with in and in the lower margin was due primarily to reduced selling prices and less than optimal product mix 
margins were lower than in due to lower selling prices  coupled with less than full running conditions only partially offset by lower pulp costs and better productivity 
plant operations 
groundwood free coated shipments primarily wisconsin rapids and converting divisions increased in due to near capacity operations and continued productivity improvements on all paper machines  compared with a decrease in due to less than capacity operations mostly offset by productivity improvements 
during  the wisconsin rapids division operated at of available capacity  compared with in and in the industry average capacity utilization was for groundwood free grades in  in and in on average  selling prices decreased in  following a decrease of in and a increase in the converting division  which converts heavier weight groundwood free coated rolls into sheets  operated at of available capacity  compared with in and in groundwood coated shipments biron  wisconsin river and niagara divisions increased in  following a decline in the divisions operated at of available capacity  compared with in and almost in the us industry average utilization was for groundwood grades in  in and in during  selling prices declined  following a decline of in and an increase of in lake superior paper industries supercalendered groundwood paper operated at of available capacity in  compared with in and in shipments in increased  compared to a increase in year was a full year of operations  compared with a half year in continued weak markets resulted in selling prices declining in  compared with a decline of in and an increase of in the stevens point division s coated specialty paper shipments increased in  compared with declines of in and in the mill s newest paper machine  no 
 which increased the division s annual capacity from  tons to  tons  began operations during the first quarter of and exceeded our expectations for quality and productivity 
due to the added capacity and weakened markets  the division operated at of available capacity for  compared with in and in selling prices decreased in  following a decrease of in and an increase of in superior recycled fiber industries operated at of available capacity in  compared with in and in reduced demand for recycled pulps resulted in continued selling price reductions of in paperboard products shipments decreased  and corrugated products shipments increased in the paperboard products and corrugated products businesses both operated in highly competitive markets and continued their marketing emphasis on producing high value added specialty products 
inter lake papers  inc formerly repap  usa  inc 
which produces a combination of groundwood free and groundwood coated papers  operated at of available capacity during the fourth quarter of this facility was acquired in october selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in to million  compared with increases of million in and million in the increase resulted from general inflation increases and the fold in of the inter lake papers selling  general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter 
the large increase in reflects a full year s costs for the july acquisition 
other income and income taxes 
other income expense was million in  million in and million in included in the interest expense and interest income for is million and million  respectively  which represents a full year s results of the sale and leaseback of two paper machines 
interest expense in increased million  primarily due to the higher debt associated with the october acquisition 
details are included in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
effective tax rates were  and in  and  respectively 
the lower rates in and are due to lower state taxes and some resolution of long standing tax audits 
liquidity and capital resources 
current account changes 
the october and july acquisitions were accounted for as purchases  and the assets and liabilities  which have been stated at their fair value  affect the comparison to prior periods 
accounts receivable in increased by million  of which million represents inter lake papers  inc  compared with a decrease of million in and an increase of million in  principally due to the acquisition 
the increase exclusive of the acquisition was principally due to greater sales volume 
the days sales outstanding has not materially changed  and the company believes its collection period is well within the industry s standards 
inventories increased million compared with  of which million was due to inter lake papers  inc finished goods increased million  of which million was due to inter lake papers and the rest was mainly due to the company maintaining higher inventory levels to be more responsive to customer needs 
raw materials increased million  and stores supplies increased million  with inter lake papers contributing million and million  respectively 
prepaid expenses decreased million  primarily due to the lake superior paper industries lease buy out  which resulted in the reclassification of a million prepaid lease expense to plant and equipment 
accounts payable increased million  of which million was due to inter lake papers and the difference was due to timings of payments 
payroll and employee benefits increased million  of which million was due to inter lake papers and the rest was primarily due to full operations in  compared with less than full operations at the end of the year end ratio of current assets to current liabilities was in  compared with in and in most of the increase resulted from no current maturities of long term debt at the end of capital commitments and spending 
at the end of  authorized but uncompleted capital projects totaled million 
a capital approval budget of million is in place 
this million  plus the million carry over from  less anticipated carry over of million at the end of  will result in planned capital spending of million in  compared with expenditures of million in  million in and million in the major expenditures included million for a lease buy out of a paper machine at lake superior paper industries  million for completion of a paper machine addition at the stevens point division  million for a paper machine rebuild project at lake superior papers  million for a new supercalender at the niagara division  and million for a finished goods warehouse expansion at the converting division 
the capital approval budget for million consists of million for necessary replacement and quality projects  million for high return projects  nearly million for a paper machine rebuild at the biron division to be completed in and million for environmental control projects 
included in the approval budget is million for new projects for the inter lake papers operation 
long term debt 
the company s borrowings as of year end were million  an increase of million  following increases of million in and million in the increase primarily resulted from the inter lake papers acquisition for million in cash and the assumption of million of debt  of which million of the face value was refinanced in december the financing for the acquisition including the december refinancing was provided from proceeds of a private placement of million of senior notes and proceeds under a new million revolving credit facility 
in december  the company completed the sale and leaseback of its new no 
paper machine at the stevens point division 
the proceeds for the sale of million were used to pay down debt of the revolving credit facility 
the lease will be classified as an operating lease  and the term of the lease is expected to be approximately years 
as of december  the company has million available for further use under its million revolving credit facility 
the company also has unused lines of credit of approximately million 
such amounts  together with cash flow from future operations  are expected to be more than sufficient to fund projected capital commitments 
interest increased  excluding interest related to the sale and leaseback of two paper machines  totaling almost million in  with million charged against income and million capitalized as a part of the cost of related capital projects 
substantially all of the machinery and equipment at lake superior paper industries was under operating leases 
the company had options under these leases to purchase the interests of the owner participants at set prices at various times during the leases and again at the conclusion of the leases for the then fair market value of the equipment 
according to the terms of the leases  in december  the company commenced the conversion of the operating leases by buying out one of five owner participants 
completed in january  the lease was converted to a balance sheet asset and will be reported as conventional debt 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company entered into sale and leaseback transactions for two paper machines during these leases are capital in nature  resulting in lease obligations of million at december  because deposits of million at december   are believed to be adequate for future lease payments  the company will not need to generate or borrow significant additional funds to make the required lease payments 
environmental matters 
the paper industry is subject to extensive environmental regulations  many of which require significant capital and operational expenditures 
in  the company completed a multiphase chlorine reduction program involving equipment and process changes at the kraft division  which manufactures chemical pulp 
this program was designed to ensure compliance with dioxin wastewater permit limitations and with wisconsin regulations requiring best available chloroform emission control technology 
mechanical pulp manufactured by the company for use at its groundwood mills is bleached using a totally chlorine free process 
the clean air act amendments of and the clean water act effluent guidelines limitations are expected to have a significant financial impact on the paper industry 
the us environmental protection agency epa recently adopted rules to reduce the industry s discharge of air and water pollutants  and has proposed additional rules to further reduce industry emissions of hazardous air pollutants 
the additional proposed regulations addressing air pollutants are subject to further change prior to final promulgation  now expected in february  these final and proposed regulations are commonly referred to as the cluster rules 
the company s review of the cluster rules indicates that additional capital expenditures of approximately million for process and equipment changes will likely be required three years after the cluster rules are final 
additional annual operating costs of approximately million also may be required 
other statutory and regulatory environmental initiatives now under consideration could have a material impact on the pulp and paper industry 
these initiatives include mandated reductions in greenhouse gases by energy intensive industries and efforts to further reduce access to fiber sources 
the company is a potentially responsible party with respect to several hazardous waste sites under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla 
while cercla provides for joint and several liability  remediation costs are generally allocated among waste generators and others involved with the site 
the company has established accruals for its share of estimated cleanup costs at these sites 
these accruals are reviewed periodically and adjusted when appropriate 
accruals as of december were less than million in the aggregate 
the company continues to follow closely sediment remediation activities under way on various watershed systems  including the fox river and wisconsin river 
on the fox river  state and federal agencies have focused on study and remediation of sediments containing polychlorinated biphenols pcbs  which are believed to have been discharged by companies which manufactured or recycled carbonless papers in the s and early s 
neither the company s former appleton division  closed in l  nor the inter lake papers facility  acquired in  was involved in carbonless paper manufacture or recycling 
however  it is possible that the scope of fox river remediation efforts will expand  and remediation activities may impact operations at inter lake papers 
on the wisconsin river  the wisconsin department of natural resources has prepared a comprehensive management plan cmp addressing a variety of environmental issues relating to the petenwell and castle rock flowages  including sediment contamination and water quality 
these flowages are artificial impoundments created by dams downstream of the company s operations 
the cmp calls for further environmental studies of the flowages  but contains no mandatory timetables or overall funding mechanism for any remedial actions which ultimately may be required 
the company is engaged in groundwater studies at its niagara facility 
lagoon closure activities at this facility were completed in management believes that the resolution of existing environmental matters will not have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
year compliance 
the company is assessing the impact of the year on its operations  including business information systems  manufacturing systems and infrastructure systems 
although final plans and costs estimates are not yet determinable  the company expects to complete its assessment in and does not expect the modification expenses to have a material impact on the company s ongoing results of operations 
forward looking statements 
certain statements in management s discussion and analysis and elsewhere in the company s annual report to shareholders may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of because these forward looking statements include risks and uncertainties  actual future results may differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the statements 
factors that could cause actual results to differ include  among other things increased competition from either domestic or foreign paper producers  including increases in competitive capacity through construction of new mills or conversion of older facilities to produce competitive products  variations in demand for the company s products  changes in the cost or availability of the raw materials used by the company  particularly market pulp and wood  costs of compliance with new environmental laws and regulations  decisions by the company to make a significant acquisition or a significant increase in production capacity  and unanticipated costs or problems associated with year compliance
