average occupancy rates increased slightly from in to in the transactions that had the greatest influence on the company s reported results in were i the acquisition of an industrial research and development property in april the tanon buildings  ii the acquisition of acre parcel of undeveloped land in june prospect park  and iii the acquisition of an industrial research and development property in november the hathaway business park 
the company financed the acquisitions of the research and development properties with a combination of permanent financing and draws under its line of credit 
the acquisition of the undeveloped parcel of land was financed by a draw on the line of credit 
results of operations comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  total revenue increased in over the increase was attributable to a increase in rental revenue offset by a decrease in interest income 
rental revenues increased over the prior year as a result of the lam research buildings acquisition that took place in the last quarter of as well as the acquisition of the tanon building and hathaway business park that took place in occupancy rates and rental revenues remained stable on the existing properties occupied throughout both periods 
the decline in interest income was due to the sale of securities used to finance the purchase of dissenting shareholders stock in total expenses rose million in primarily due to the acquisition of property by the company 
the addition of the lam buildings in october and the acquisitions in has led to an increase in interest expense  depreciation and operational costs 
interest expense increased   net of amounts capitalized  over the prior period as a result of the additional borrowings used to finance the purchase of the three new properties in and on borrowings used to finance the lam research building acquired in october  an additional  of debt was added in net of repayments 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings decreased from in to in property operating expenses increased in as compared to the prior period 
this was consistent with the increase in property owned by the company 
property taxes and utility expenses formed the bulk of the increased costs experienced in there was no change in the agreements between the company and related parties during the year 
the  increase in related party expense was primarily due to the increase in the total gross book value of real estate owned by the company  which caused the advisory fees to increase by  over the prior year 
general and administrative expenses remained at levels  despite the company s expansion 
lower director s and officer s insurance expense  stock exchange fees and general expenses in reflect the economies of scale achieved by the merger of the reits in these benefits were offset by legal fees totaling approximately  which were incurred in defending the company against two shareholder lawsuits see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the minority interest in fsrt lp net income increased  in as compared to the prior year as the partnership was set up in october and therefore reflects a full year of activity 
consolidated net income increased to  in as a result of the increased revenue from properties acquired in the period that was in excess of the additional costs incurred 
in addition  net income increased with the absence of merger related expenses and a realization of some of the economies of scale associated with the completion of the merger 
these benefits were partially offset by reduced interest income related to the sale of securities in  and to increased legal expenses 
net income per share increased by a greater amount   due to the reduced number of shares of common stock outstanding during comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  total revenue increased approximately compared to primarily due to rental revenue provided by the lam research buildings which were acquired on october  rental revenue for the seven properties that the company owned for the entire year improved in  reflecting stable rental rates and occupancy rates for both periods 
interest income declined  compared to due to the sale of mortgage backed securities in october total expenses increased approximately  or  compared to primarily due to an increase in expenses related to the merger  and due to interest expense  depreciation expense and minority interest expense related to the lam research buildings which were acquired in during  the company incurred non recurring expenses related to the merger  totaling approximately  compared to  in the expenses were comprised of i consolidation expense of  and  respectively  ii general and administrative expenses of  and  respectively  and iii a loss on the sale of mortgage backed securities of  in  which was recorded when the company sold securities to provide cash for the repurchase of shares dissenting from the merger 
property operating expenses  which generally include maintenance and repairs  property taxes  utilities  and on site administrative expense  declined slightly compared to due to non recurring expenses recorded in related to discontinuing operations of a self service car wash at the mira loma center 
excluding those expenses  operating expenses increased approximately compared to in  minor increases in several expense categories were offset by a decline in electricity expense caused by milder summertime temperatures in southern california 
the acquisition of the lam research buildings did not cause property operating expenses to increase in since the tenant pays the expenses directly 
related party expense increased  or in reflecting an increase in advisory fees of  and an increase in property management fees of  which were partially offset by a decline of  in reimbursements to the advisor for accounting and data processing costs 
the increase in advisory fees was caused by the acquisition of the lam research buildings  and the adoption of the company s advisory agreement by the two reits that merged with the company in may prior to the merger  the reits operated under advisory agreements containing different methods of compensation to the advisor 
general and administrative expense increased approximately  in primarily due to legal and consulting fees related to locating potential property acquisitions  expenses of transferring ownership of the data general building to fsrt  and a temporary increase in stock exchange fees that was attributable to the merger 
partly offsetting these increases were declines in the cost of directors and officers insurance coverage and transfer agent expense  reflecting economies of scale after the merger 
net income declined approximately  or in largely due to an increase in merger related expenses  an increase in advisory fees subsequent to the merger  and a decline in interest income caused by the sale of mortgage backed securities 
net income per share also declined  but by a lesser percentage  due to a decline in the number of shares outstanding after the company purchased the dissenting shares 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company s cash and cash equivalents aggregated  which the company believes is adequate to meet its short term operating cash requirements 
the company also has access to a revolving line of credit in the amount of million which had an outstanding balance of million at year end 
the company also holds  of mortgage backed securities 
during  the company s cash and cash equivalents increased to  compared to  at december  the increase in cash was generated from operating cash flows and from borrowings offset by amounts paid to acquire property 
operations generated  an increase of  over the previous year as a result of the property acquisitions in late and during and due to the absence of merger related expenses 
the acquisition of property and other investing activities used  in  compared to an inflow of cash in of  the inflow of cash in the previous year was primarily the result of the sale of securities to fund the repurchase of common stock 
the company borrowed  in to fund property acquisitions and refinance loans during the year  but this cash inflow was offset by loan repayments and by distribution payments  so that total cash generated from financing activities was  for at december  the company believes its cash and cash equivalents are adequate to meet its short term operating cash requirements 
the company s investment in mortgage backed securities at december   is represented by a fnma adjustable rate pass through certificate with a market value of approximately  although payments of principal and interest are guaranteed by fnma  changes in market interest rates may cause the security s market value to fluctuate  which could result in a gain or loss if the security is sold before maturity 
in  the company entered into an agreement with the bank of america for a million secured revolving line of credit to provide funding for future acquisitions and general business purposes 
borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at the london interbank offered rate libor plus  or at the bank s reference rate at the company s option 
the credit facility is secured by mortgages on three of the company s properties which collectively accounted for of the company s rental revenue  together with the rental proceeds from such properties 
at december   these properties comprised approximately of the company s net real estate assets 
the credit agreement contains customary representations  restrictive covenants  and events of default  including a covenant limiting quarterly distributions to of funds from operations 
the company does not anticipate that this covenant will adversely affect the ability of the company to declare distributions to shareholders under the company s current distribution policy 
at december   the unused balance available under the line of credit was million the company s mortgage indebtedness has the following balloon payments million  million  million  and million 
in addition  the company s million credit facility  which had an outstanding balance of million at december   matures in december of the credit facility agreement provides the company with one option to extend the maturity date of the credit facility for a period of one year 
the company expects to exercise that option during the company does not anticipate that its cash flow from operations will be sufficient to make all of the balloon payments of principal when due under its mortgage indebtedness and its credit facility 
the company intends to make such payments by refinancing or extending the indebtedness or by raising funds through the sale of equity securities or properties 
if the company is unable to extend  refinance  or payoff its indebtedness when due  the mortgaged properties could be become the property of the mortgagee with a subsequent loss of income and asset value to the company 
as of december   the company had approximately million of variable rate mortgage indebtedness outstanding which bears interest at a floating rate tied to the union bank reference rate 
in addition  the outstanding balance under the company s revolving line of credit bears interest at a floating rate tied to the london interbank offered rates libor 
the company intends to use the remaining portion of the line of credit to provide short term financing for future acquisitions 
an increase in interest rates may have an adverse effect on the company s net income and funds from operations 
in  the company intends to remedy defects discovered in the window system at fairway center for a cost of approximately million 
the company expects to receive  in partial settlement of a claim in respect of the defects and will also pursue other third parties to further offset the costs 
in connection with any lease renewal or new leasing  the company will incur costs for tenant improvements and leasing commissions which it intends to fund first from operating cash flow and then  if necessary  from cash on hand or the line of credit 
at december   the company held two properties for sale prospect park  an undeveloped parcel of land that was sold in january for million and carmel mountain  a retail center in san diego that the company intends to sell in approximately million of the proceeds from the sale of prospect park were used to reduce borrowings under the line of credit 
net proceeds from the sale of carmel mountain after the payoff of debt secured on the property will also be used to reduce borrowings under the line of credit 
impact of inflation the company s policy of negotiating leases which incorporate operating expense pass through provisions is intended to protect the company against increased operating costs resulting from inflation 
inflation  however  could increase the company s borrowing costs 
potential factors affecting future operating results decline in interest income  loss on sale of mortgage backed securities in years prior to  net income was positively affected by interest income that the company earned from its investments in mortgage backed securities 
in addition  the company periodically sustained losses upon the sale of certain of these securities 
late in  the company liquidated a substantial portion of its mortgage backed securities in order to provide funds to repurchase a portion of its outstanding common stock 
therefore  the company does not anticipate generating significant amounts of interest income  gains or losses from these securities  in future years 
the repurchase of the company s common stock in has had a positive effect on net income per share  due to the related decline in the number of shares outstanding 
year the company is in the process of assessing the impact of year issues on its computer systems and applications 
at this time  management believes that the costs associated with resolving these issues will not have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
leasing turnover in connection with any lease renewal or new lease  the company typically incurs costs for tenant improvements and leasing commissions which will be funded first from operating cash flow and  if necessary  from cash reserves or the line of credit 
in addition  while the company has historically been successful in renewing and re leasing space  the company will be subject to the risk that leases expiring in the future may be renewed or re leased at terms that are less favorable than current lease terms 
leasing turnover data general building the data general building is located in an area of los angeles county that has historically been dominated by aerospace and defense related companies 
because many of the defense programs that these companies are engaged in have been curtailed  their office space requirements were substantially reduced  causing greater vacancies and lower market rental rates 
during  however  market conditions significantly improved 
based on the most recently available reports from cb commercial real estate group  at october   the manhattan beach el segundo sub market  had a total vacancy factor of  compared to at october  over the next two years  the company s leasing exposure at the data general building consists of one lease covering  square feet  which expires in january the lease carries a triple net rental rate that is equivalent to approximately per square foot on a full service basis 
compared to the annual effective rental rate of the most recently executed lease at the property per square foot the expiring lease provides overmarket rent of approximately  annually  or of the company s total revenue in while it is impossible to predict the market rental rate in  the company expects that when this lease expires  the rental income related to this space will be less than per square foot regardless of whether the lease is renewed or new leases are signed 
the company will also incur costs for tenant improvements and leasing commissions upon the renewal or re leasing of the space  however  the amounts are unknown at this time 
management believes that the company s sources of capital as described under liquidity and capital resources are adequate to meet its liquidity needs in the foreseeable future 
funds from operations the company considers funds from operations to be a useful measure of the operating performance of an equity reit because  together with net income and cash flows  funds from operations provides investors with an additional basis to evaluate the ability of a reit to support general operating expense and interest expense before the impact of certain activities  such as gains and losses from property sales and changes in the accounts receivable and accounts payable 
however  it does not measure whether income is sufficient to fund all of the company s cash needs including principal amortization  capital improvements and distributions to stockholders 
funds from operations should not be considered an alternative to net income or any other gaap measurement of performance  as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  funds from operations is net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustment for unconsolidated joint ventures 
the company reports funds from operations in accordance with the revised nareit definition 
the change in the nareit definition in had no material effect on the amounts reported by the company as funds from operations in prior periods 
the measure of funds from operations as reported by the company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies that follow different definitions 
funds from operations dollars in thousands year ended december  net income    add depreciation and    amortization funds from operations    the primary difference between the periods reflects the changes in merger related expenses and losses on the sale of mortgage backed securities as discussed under results of operations 
funds from operations in also benefited from the company s property acquisitions in and
