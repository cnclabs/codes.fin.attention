on february   the company sold all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of its wholly owned subsidiaries  american international petroleum corporation of colombia aipcc and pan american international petroleum corporation paipc the purchased shares in an arms length transaction the mip transaction to mercantile international petroleum inc mip 
the assets of aipcc and paipc consisted of oil and gas properties and equipment in south america with an aggregate net book value of approximately million 
the total aggregate purchase price payable by mip for the purchased shares was valued  giving account to the contingent portion thereof  which was not recorded by the company pursuant to gaap  at up to approximately million  determined as follows a cash payments of approximately million  of which approximately million was paid simultaneously with the closing to retire the company s secured debentures due december   which were secured by the company s shares of aipcc

since the mip transaction  the company has sold approximately million mip shares for total net proceeds of approximately million 
these proceeds were used primarily for working capital needs and payment of debt 
in january  the company exercised its right  pursuant to the exchangeable debenture  to demand payment from mip on february  of million of the principal balance thereof  which payment  along with accrued interest  was paid to the company by mip in february since the closing of the mip transaction and the termination of its lease agreement with gold line in the first quarter of  the company has had no revenues from operations  until late in the first quarter of when it implemented product sales at the refinery 
although it has utilized some of the proceeds from the mip transaction to fund the refinery expansion and start up processes  its activities in kazakstan and other operations  such proceeds were inadequate to satisfy all of the company s debt obligations and capital requirements 
therefore  during  the company issued various promissory notes and convertible debentures in exchange for an aggregate of approximately million through certain private placement and agreements  most of which were issued in reliance upon the safe harbor provided by regulation s as promulgated under the act 
in addition  the company received approximately million and  from the exercise of company s warrants during  and during the first quarter of  respectively 
the company utilized most of the cash proceeds from these transactions to fund its operations and activities at the refinery and in kazakstan  for payment of debt  and for general corporate purposes 
the company s recent agreement with the irs see item legal proceedings calls for the company to pay  in excise taxes  plus interest occurred for the applicable periods 
the company has submitted a proposal to the irs which would enable the company to pay the tax and interest due over a period of approximately one year  the tax would be paid in four equal quarterly installments and the interest would be paid in a lump sum at the end of the annual payment period 
should the company utilize the entire proposed pay off period to pay the tax and interest  the total amount paid would be approximately million 
during the next twelve months  excluding its pending acquisitions in florida and russia  discussed above  the company expects to expend up to million  of which approximately million is expected to be spent on costs associated with its kazakstan project  million for debt payment and other corporate uses  and the remainder for its refinery activities 
however  if the company obtains a joint venture partner in kazakstan  its capital expenditure requirements there would be significantly less than million during the next twelve months 
in february  the construction necessary to expand and enhance the refinery was essentially completed and the company began the processing of crude oils to produce asphalt and other products 
the company was very successful with its january and february bids in texas and louisiana in recent lettings for asphalt 
in essentially one month it secured several million dollars worth of orders for polymerized and conventional asphalt products 
beginning in the second quarter of  it plans to process an average of approximately  barrels of crude oil feedstock per day 
the company has warrants outstanding which  if exercised  would provide it with approximately million to fund its capital and other commitments 
however  there can be no assurance that a sufficient number of warrants will be exercised to provide the company with all of the capital it requires 
in addition  the company is having discussions with various companies who have expressed an interest in participating with the company in its endeavors in kazakstan and in louisiana 
in april  the company reached an agreement with certain institutional investors which will provide it with up to million in private debt and equity financing the debt and equity financing to be used by the company on an as needed basis over a two year period 
initial funding could start as early as april   pending the execution of definitive documents scheduled for april  depending on its needs  the company could use a portion or all of the facility 
the closing of the debt and equity financing will ensure that the company has the capital necessary to fund its obligations and operations  at least through the year ended december  the company plans to utilize its existing working capital and proceeds from the exercise of warrants until the cash flows anticipated from its asphalt operations in are sufficient in nature to satisfy its needs 
in the event the debt and equity financing is not consummated  or a sufficient number of warrants are not exercised  or if the company is unable to obtain sufficient alternative financing  or if its asphalt operations are less successful than anticipated  certain projects may be delayed or canceled 
impact of changing prices the company s revenues  its ability to repay indebtedness and the carrying value of its oil and gas properties owned are affected from time to time by changes in oil and gas prices 
oil and natural gas prices are subject to substantial seasonal  political and other fluctuations that are beyond the ability of the company to control 
since crude oil prices are an important determining factor in the carrying value of oil and gas assets  significant reductions in the price of crude oil could require non cash write downs of the carrying value of those assets

due to these circumstances no refinery lease fee revenues were recorded for for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  refinery lease fee revenue increased by approximately in to  compared to  in the increase was due to the increase in the throughput processing fee from to per barrel processed and in the increase in its throughput barrels by during  primarily due to gold line having its feedstock financing in place throughout compared to being shutdown for the first quarter of due to a lack of financing

approximately of the decrease was attributed to the lack of any production from the peru properties during average oil prices  net of transportation  increased  however  by or per barrel to in  as compared to in due to renegotiated oil sales contracts and higher oil prices in the increase in oil prices during more than offset the decline in oil production for period  resulting in a increase in oil revenues in compared to production costs had a net increase of  or in compared to transportation costs of  accounted for of the increase in during  an increase in g a overhead allocation of  to production costs accounted for of the increase 
this increase in overhead allocation is directly related to a corresponding decrease in total g a expenses 
other income for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  other income increased during to approximately  from  in  due primarily to a  increase in interest income in to  compared to  in this improvement is attributable to an increase in funds on deposit during compared to and to an accretion of interest on notes receivable of  during an additional increase of approximately  was attributable to a non cash income item as a result of a negotiated reduction in certain accounts payable 
these increases were partially offset by decreases of approximately  in foreign exchange rate gains and other income in colombia and peru in compared to for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  other income decreased by approximately  during to  compared to  in this was due primarily to a decrease in interest income of to  compared to  in  related to a decrease in funds on deposit during  and to the company not recognizing  of interest income during  related to notes due from gold line 
general and administrative for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  total general and administrative expenses g a increased during by approximately  or compared to  primarily due to non cash charges of  from the extension of expiration dates on certain outstanding employee stock options and  for stock options issued for investor relations costs

management believes that the related amount of interest recorded by the company is not necessarily the true cost to the company of the instruments it issued and that it may be reasonable to conclude that the fair value of the common stock into which these securities may be converted was less than such stock s quoted market price at the date the convertible securities were issued considering factors such as the period for which sale of the stock is restricted  which in certain cases was as long as six months  large block factors  lack of a sufficiently active market into which the stock can be quickly sold  time value  etc however  generally accepted accounting principles require that an intrinsic value of the conversion feature at the date of issuance should be accounted for and that such incremental yield should be measured based on the stock s quoted market price at the date of issuance  regardless if such yield is assured 
the company expenses and also capitalizes certain other costs associated with the offering and sale of debentures 
capitalized costs are amortized as interest expense over the life of the related debt instrument

debenture costs incurred and amortized in increased by  to  as compared to these costs were related to debentures outstanding at december  realized and unrealized loss on marketable securities as partial proceeds from the mip transaction  the company received approximately million shares of mip common stock valued at per share 
however  since the closing  the market value of mip s shares have declined to per share at december  the company sold and disposed of approximately  shares of the mip shares during for proceeds of approximately  the company has recorded an aggregate net realized and unrealized loss of  as of december  loss on sale of assets the company recorded an aggregate  loss on the sale of two of its wholly owned subsidiaries which includes the current discount to fair value of the million exchangeable debenture and the million performance earn out  both received in the mip transaction
