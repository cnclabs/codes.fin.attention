item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year ended may  fiscal year compared to year ended may  fiscal year the company s revenue increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year as a result of higher sales volume and higher sales prices at the company s forgings and castings divisions 
these revenue increases during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year are reflected by market as follows a million increase in aerospace  a million increase in energy and a million decrease in other 
the reasons for the strength in the aerospace market were higher airplane and engine build rates and higher demands for spares by aerospace engine prime contractors 
although there were higher shipments to aerospace customers during fiscal year  the shipments to aerospace customers were impacted by the company s  ton press being out of service for repairs for six months 
the increase in energy revenue was a result of higher shipments of land based gas turbine products in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the cause of the decrease in other markets is primarily due to the decline in the titanium golf club head business as the company exited this business 
revenues in fiscal year were limited by raw material shortages and production delays caused by capacity constraints of the company s suppliers 
revenues in fiscal year were limited due to lower than anticipated productivity of recent equipment and personnel additions  unanticipated repairs of equipment and inconsistencies in raw material deliveries corresponding to customer requirements  as noted above 
the company s backlog increased to  million at may  from million at may  this increase resulted from the following factors higher build rates of the company s engine and airframe customers  higher prices for the company s aerospace products  and an increase in overdue orders to customer delivery dates as a result of shipping delays at the company due to equipment repairs and raw material unavailability 
the company does not expect that this rate of increase in backlog will continue since it expects that customer orders will not increase at the same rates as in the recent past  and that capacity enhancements  refurbishments and additions installed by the company will enable the company to meet its customer demands in a more timely fashion 
of the company s total current backlog  million is shippable in the next twelve months 
because of the additional production capacity  generated from equipment enhancements  refurbishments and additions  the company believes that it will be able to fulfill those twelve month requirements 
the company s gross margins were in fiscal year as compared to in fiscal year gross margin in fiscal year was negatively affected by the impact of the company s  ton press being taken out of service for repairs for six months

the company expects that the addition of these presses and recent repair and enhancement of the company s  ton press in houston will improve the company s ability to meet its customer requirements 
gross margin in fiscal year was negatively affected by higher raw material costs which could not be passed on to customers as a result of the then existing long term agreements with customers and by price and demand declines within the titanium golf club head business

however  in the future  the company may make additional capital contributions to the australian joint venture to satisfy its cash or other requirements and may be required to recognize its share of any additional losses or may write off such additional capital contributions 
there were no contributions made to the joint venture in fiscal year interest expense increased million to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the increase results primarily from an issuance of million of senior notes offset by repayment of million of senior notes

the decrease resulted from the items described above 
year ended may  fiscal year compared to year ended may  fiscal year the company s revenue increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year as a result of higher sales volume at the company s forgings and castings divisions 
these sales volume increases during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year are reflected by market as follows a million increase in aerospace  a million increase in energy and a million decrease in other 
the reasons for the strength in the aerospace market were higher airplane and engine build rates and higher demands for spares by aerospace engine prime contractors 
although there were higher extruded pipe shipments to energy customers for fiscal  the shipments to energy customers were impacted by the week shutdown of the  ton vertical extrusion press in houston due to the industrial accident at the houston  texas  facility of wyman gordon forgings  inc the cause of the decrease in other markets is primarily due to the decline in the titanium head golf club business because of oversupply  cost disadvantages and decreased demand 
revenues in fiscal year and  to a lesser extent  in fiscal year were limited by raw material shortages and production delays caused by capacity constraints of the company s suppliers 
the company believes that the increase in order activity reflects a continued increase in spares demand and new business resulting from increasing production rates on commercial aircraft by commercial airframe primes 
the company s backlog increased to million at may  from million at may  this increase resulted from the following factors higher build rates of the company s engine and airframe customers  higher prices for the company s aerospace products  particularly as reflected in the new long term agreements ltas which went into effect on january   and an increase in overdue orders to customer delivery dates as a result of shipping delays at the company due to capacity constraints and raw material unavailability

because of the additional production capacity that the company and its suppliers are installing  the company believes that it will be able to fulfill those twelve month requirements 
the company s gross margins were in fiscal year as compared to in fiscal year the improvement in gross margins resulted from higher production volumes  continued emphasis on cost reductions  productivity gains resulting from the company s continuing efforts toward focusing forging production of rotating parts for jet engines in its houston  texas  facility and forging production of airframe structures and large turbine parts in its grafton  massachusetts  facility and continuing realization of cost reductions from synergies associated with the integration of cameron in fiscal year and fiscal year the company believes that the improvements in gross margin would have been greater except that the company incurred higher raw material costs which could not be passed on to customers as a result of the then existing ltas with its customers 
beginning in the second half of fiscal year  higher demand required the company to purchase certain raw materials under terms not covered by ltas with its vendors 
the current rebound in demand for many of these raw materials  especially nickel and titanium  resulted in significant market price increases which negatively affected the company s gross margins 
the company began to see pricing relief for its products in early calendar  when certain ltas that the company negotiated with its customers went into effect  allowing the company to pass some raw material price increases on to its customers 
gross margins in fiscal year were also negatively impacted by price and demand declines within the titanium golf club head business because of oversupply  cost disadvantages and decreased demand 
gross margin was negatively impacted by a lifo charge of million in fiscal year as compared to a favorable impact by a lifo credit of million in fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million during fiscal year from million during fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues improved to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the improvement as a percent of revenues is the result of higher revenues

all earnings per share amounts for all periods have been presented and  where necessary  restated to conform to the sfas requirements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 reporting comprehensive income sfas 
the implementation of sfas will require that the components of comprehensive income be reported in the financial statements

 employers disclosures about pensions and other post retirement benefits sfas 
sfas standardizes disclosure requirements of statement nos 
 employers accounting for pensions  and  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
implementation of this standard is required for the year ending may  year the year computer issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the computer programs in the company s computer systems and plant equipment systems that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculation causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company s overall year project approach and status is as follows stage of estimated timetable description of approach completion for completion computer systems assess systems for possible year impact completed modify or replace non compliant systems may  test systems with system clocks set at current date may  test systems off line with system clocks set at various year related critical dates may  plant equipment computer dependent plant equipment assessment and compliance procedures performed may  the company has completed a comprehensive inventory of substantially all computer systems and programs 
all hardware required for stand alone testing of systems has been installed in order to perform off line testing for year program compliance 
the company has identified all software supplied by outside vendors that are not year compliant 
with respect to approximately such non compliant software the company has acquired the most recent release and is currently testing such versions for year compliance 
all software developed in house has been reviewed and necessary modifications have been completed and are in the final stages of testing 
in addition to assessing the company s year readiness  the company has contacted and sent questionnaires regarding year readiness to most of its suppliers 
over have responded thus far 
of this amount  the majority of the company s top suppliers have responded and believe they will be year compliant prior to december  on site audits of our key suppliers are currently being coordinated in order to assess their year system readiness 
the company is using both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  and test software for year modifications 
the year project is complete and the company anticipates completing the project by mid maintenance or modification costs will be expensed as incurred  while the costs of new information technology will be capitalized and amortized in accordance with company policy 
the company is uncertain of the cost of making its computer dependent plant equipment year compliant due to the early stages of this part of the year computer project 
the estimated cost of the year computer project  including software modifications  consultants  replacement costs for non compliant systems and internal personnel costs  based on presently available information  is not material to the financial operations of the company and is estimated at approximately million 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed in time  the year computer issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company is currently making year contingency plans 
the company has multiple business systems at different locations 
in case of the failure of a system at one location  the company s contingency plan is to evaluate the use of an alternate compliant business system at another location 
the company will continue to assess possible contingency plan solutions 
the forecast costs and the date on which the company believes it will complete its year computer modifications are based on its best estimates  which  in turn  were based on numerous assumptions of future events  including third party modification plans  continued availability of resources and other factors 
the company cannot be sure that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated
