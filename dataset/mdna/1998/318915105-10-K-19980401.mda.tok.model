item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview total assets increased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  this increase is primarily attributable to management s decision to begin a leverage program in april using low cost federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings of million to fund the purchase of higher yielding mortgage backed securities and investment securities 
loans receivable net increased million to million at december   from million at the end of these increases were offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million to million at december   from million at december  in addition to the million of fhlb advances used in the leverage program  total liabilities increased also as a result of total deposits increasing million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million at the end of stockholders equity decreased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  this decrease was primarily due to an increase in treasury stock of million to million at december   from million for the same period last year

total interest income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase was due to an increase in the average balance of earning assets of million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  interest income on loans increased  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the average balance of the loan portfolio increased million  or  to million at december   from million for the year ended december  this was offset by a decrease in the average yield of the loan portfolio to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  interest income on mortgage backed securities held to maturity increased  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this was due to an increase in the average yield to from for the year ended december  this increase was offset by a decrease in the average balance of mortgage backed securities held to maturity of  or  to million from million for the year ended december  interest income on mortgage backed securities available for sale increased  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the preceding year 
this was due to increases in both the average balance and the average yield 
the average balance increased million  or  to million for from million for the year ended december  this was coupled with an increase in the average yield to  for the year ending december  from for the year ended december  interest income on investments held to maturity increased  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period last year

interest income on investments available for sale increased  or  to million from  for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to an increase in the average balance of million  or  to million for the year ended december from million for the year ended in addition  the average yield increased basis points to from for the year ended december  interest expense 
interest expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to the cost associated with the borrowed funds used by the bank in its leverage program 
for the year ended december   the bank s average cost of funds on deposits and borrowings increased to from for the period ended december  the average balance of certificate accounts increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   while the average balance of core deposits increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the average balance of borrowed funds for the year ended december   was million with an average cost of 
the company anticipates increasing its borrowings in future periods to fund increases in its asset base through the purchase of investments and mortgage backed securities 
interest expense may increase in future periods due to such borrowings 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses for the year ended december   decreased  or  to  from  for the year ended december  the decrease provision reflects a continued decline in the amount of newly classified loans and the continuing resolution of existing non performing assets 
non performing loans  defined as non accrual loans and accruing loans delinquent days or more  increased  or  to million at december   from million at december  at december   and december   the allowance for loan losses was million 
future provisions for loan losses will continue to be based on management s assessment of the loan portfolio and its underlying collateral  trends in non performing loans  current economic conditions and other factors which warrant recognition in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels sufficient to provide for estimated future losses 
although management uses the best information available  adjustments may be necessary due to economic  operating  regulatory and other conditions that may be beyond the bank s control 
non interest income 
non interest income increased  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the prior year 
the increase was due to several factors including increases in the safe deposit box rental fees  service charges on now accounts and late charges on mortgage loans 
non interest expense 
non interest expense increased  or to million for the year ended december   from million for the prior year  exclusive of the one time fdic special assessment 
this increase was due primarily to an increase in compensation and benefit expense of  the increase in compensation and employee benefit expense is due to the addition of staff at the company s two new retail offices in passaic and morris counties  new jersey  and the amortization of stock based benefit plans beginning in the addition of the two new retail offices also resulted in small increases in occupancy  equipment and advertising costs 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in fdic insurance expense 
income tax expense 
income tax expense increased  or  to million for the year ended december   from  for the prior year 
the increase was due to the company s increased income before taxes for the year ended december   compared to the same period in comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and general 
net income for the year ended december   was  compared with  for the same period in this increase reflects an increase in net interest income offset by the one time saif assessment of million 
net interest income 
for the year ended december   net interest income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the prior period 
the company s net interest rate spread decreased slightly by basis points to from for the year ended december  this was offset by an increase in interest earning assets of million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  interest income 
total interest income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the prior year 
this increase resulted primarily from increases in interest income on mortgage backed securities and investment securities offset by decrease in interest income on mortgage loans 
the average balance of the loan portfolio decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for this was coupled with a decrease in the average yield on loans from for the period ending december   to for the year ended the decrease in the loan portfolio reflected payments exceeding originations and new loan purchases as the bank continued to experience weak loan demand in its primary market area 
the decrease in yield reflected the repayment of higher yielding loans in the bank s portfolio and reinvestment of such proceeds in lower yielding new loans  both through originations and purchases 
interest income on mortgage backed securities held to maturity increased  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the prior year 
the increase in income was due partly from an increase in the average balance of mortgage backed securities held to maturity of million  or  to million from million for the prior year 
this was coupled with an increase in the average yield to from reflecting current market rates of interest 
interest income on investments held to maturity increased  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the average balance increased million  or  to million for from million for the year ended december  this was coupled with an increase in the average yield from to 
interest expense 
interest expense increased by  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to increased rates paid by the bank on its deposit accounts 
for the year ended december   the bank s average cost of funds on deposits and borrowings increased to for the period ending december   from for  reflecting current market rates of interest the bank did not have any fhlbny borrowings during the year ended december  for the year ended december   the bank had fhlbny borrowings with an average cost of and average balance of million 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses decreased  or  to  for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decreased provision reflects a decline in the amount of newly classified loans  the continuing resolution of existing non performing assets and a decrease in the bank s overall loan portfolio 
non performing loans  defined as non accrual loans and accruing loans delinquent days or more  decreased by million  or to at december   from million at december  this represented a ratio of non performing loans to total assets of and at december and  respectively 
future provisions for loan losses will continue to be based on management s assessment of the loan portfolio and its underlying collateral  trends in non performing loans  current economic conditions and other factors which warrant recognition in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels sufficient to provide for estimated future losses 
although management uses the best information available  adjustments may be necessary due to economic  operating  regulatory and other conditions that may be beyond the bank s control the company s ratio of non performing assets to total assets was at december   compared to at december  the allowance for loan losses was million and million at december and  respectively 
non interest income 
non interest income increased  or  to  for the year ended december   from a loss of  for the prior period 
the increase is primarily attributable to a  loss on the sale of securities held for sale in the bank sold million of securities available for sale with below market rates of interest and reinvested the proceeds in higher yielding securities held to maturity 
non interest expense 
non interest expense increased  or  to million exclusive of the one time saif assessment of million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to an increase in net loss from real estate owned of  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for real estate owned expense increased primarily due to costs incurred by the bank to protect the priority of its liens on collateral and the costs associated with maintaining and managing properties 
compensation and employee benefit expense increased  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for income tax expense 
income tax expense increased  or  to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the prior year 
the increase was due to the company s increased income before taxes for the year ended december   compared to the same period in market risk and interest rate sensitivity analysis market risk is the potential loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending  investment and deposit taking activities 
the company s profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
a sudden and substantial increase in interest rates may adversely impact the company s earnings to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent or on the same basis 
to that end  management activity monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure 
the principal objective of the company s asset and liability management function is to evaluate the interest rate risk included in certain balance sheet accounts  determine the level of risk appropriate given the company s business focus  operating environment  capital  and liquidity requirements  establish prudent asset concentration guidelines  and manage the risk consistent with board approved guidelines 
the company seeks to reduce the vulnerability of its operations to changes in interest rates and to manage the ratio of interest rate sensitive assets to interest rate sensitive liabilities within specified maturities or repricing dates 
the company s actions in this regard are taken under the guidance of the asset liability committee alco of management with oversight provided by the board of directors 
the alco generally reviews the company s liquidity  cash flow needs  maturities of investments  deposits and borrowings and current market conditions and interest rates 
the company utilizes the following strategies to manage its interest rate risk emphasizing the origination and retention of fixed rate mortgage loans having terms to maturity of not more than ten years  purchasing fixed rate mortgage backed securities with fixed maturities of no more than years  the origination and purchase of mortgage loans with maturity dates to years providing the mortgage loan is market qualified 
reducing long term fixed rate mortgage backed securities through principal repayments and prepayments  and purchasing short term and adjustable rate investment securities  including us treasury and agency securities with maturities no greater than years 
one of the monitoring tools used by the alco is an analysis of the extent to which assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and measures the company s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets 
accordingly  during a period of rising rates  a negative gap may result in the yield on the institution s assets increasing at a slower rate than the increase in its cost of interest bearing liabilities 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  an institution with a negative gap would experience a repricing of its assets at a slower rate than its interest bearing liabilities which  consequently  may result in its net interest income growing 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which are anticipated by the company  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods presented 
except as noted  the amount of assets and liabilities which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of the term to repricing or the contractual terms of the asset or liability 
the company s loan prepayment assumptions are based upon actual historic prepayment rates and market prepayment speeds  which are per annum for loans  and a range of to per annum based upon the underlying interest rate for all mortgage backed securities 
management believes these assumptions are reasonable 
liability balances are spread upon the fdic proposed distribution rules  effective march based upon these assumptions  net interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year of december   exceeded net interest earning assets maturing or repricing within the same time period by million  representing a negative cumulative one year interest rate sensitivity gap of of total assets 
accordingly  an increase in market interest rates would be expected to have an adverse impact on net interest income

the change in npv measures an institution s vulnerability to changes in interest rates by estimating the change in the market value of an institution s assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts in response to an instantaneous change in the general level of interest rates 
the npv is defined as the current market value of assets  minus the current market value of liabilities  plus or minus the current value of off balance sheet items 
the market values are estimated through two cash flow based valuation methodologies and an option based valuation model static discounted cash flow analysis  an option based pricing analysis modified discounted cash flow analysis to value embedded options  and the black scholes model to value off balance sheet items 
the ots uses  as a critical point  a change of plus or minus basis points in order to set its normal institutional results and peer comparisons 
the greater the change  positive or negative  in npv  the more interest rate risk is assumed to exist within the institution 
a change in npv of more than of the estimated market value of an institution s assets will require the institution to deduct from its regulatory capital of that excess change 
the following table lists the bank s percentage change in npv assuming an immediate change of plus or minus up to basis points from the level of interest rates at december  net portfolio value change in interest rates in basis points amount change change rate shock dollars in thousands bp   bp   bp   bp   bp  bp   bp   bp   bp   as the table shows  increases in interest rates would result in decreases in the bank s npv  while decreases in interest rates will result in increases in the bank s npv 
at december   if the bank were subject to these specific ots regulations  the bank would not be required to deduct any amount from total capital for purposes of calculating the bank s risk based capital requirement 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methods of analysis presented in the foregoing tables 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage arm loans  have features which limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the loan 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of borrowers to service their arm loans may decrease in the event of an interest rate increases 
year a great deal of information has been disseminated about the global year many computer programs that can only distinguish the final two digits of the year entered a common programming practice in earlier years are expected to read entries for the year as the year and compute payment  interest or delinquency 
rapid and accurate data processing is essential to the operation of the company 
data processing is also essential to most other financial institutions and many other companies 
the company contracts with a service bureau to provide the majority of its data processing and is dependent upon purchased application software 
in house applications are limited to word processing and spreadsheet functions 
the company is in the process of ensuring that external vendors and the servicer are adequately addressing the system and software issues related to the year by obtaining written system certifications that the systems are fully year compliant or that the service bureau has a plan to become fully compliant in the very near future 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  the company will coordinate with the primary servicer end to end tests which allow the company to simulate daily processing on sensitive century dates 
in the evaluation  the company will ensure that critical operations will continue if the servicer or vendors are unable to achieve the year requirements 
upon the completion of the system inventory and vendor verification  the company will identify critical applications and develop detailed plans for hardware system upgrades and system replacements where necessary 
any delays  mistakes or failures could have a significant adverse impact on the financial condition and results of operation of the company 
analysis of net interest income net interest income represents the difference between income on interest earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income depends upon the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them 
the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company s statements of financial condition and the statements of income for the years ended december   and and reflects the average yield on assets and average costs that are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the periods shown 
average balances are derived from month end balances

the company s principal sources of funds are deposits  scheduled amortization and prepayments of loan principal and mortgage backed securities  maturities of investment securities and funds provided by operations 
liquidity is also available through borrowings from the federal home loan bank of new york 
while loan repayments and maturing investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds  deposit flows  prepayments and calls of investment securities and prepayment of mortgage backed securities are influenced by interest rates  general economic conditions and competition in the marketplace 
at december   total liquid assets  consisting of cash  interest bearing deposits in other banks  investment securities and mortgage backed securities  all with final maturities of five years or less  were million  or  of total assets 
this amount includes million scheduled to mature within one year  which represented of total assets and of total deposits at december  at december   the bank had commitments to originate loans totalling million  commitments to purchase loans of million and outstanding unused lines of credit of million 
the company is committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position and anticipates that it will have sufficient funds to meet its current funding commitments 
the bank does not have any balloon or other payments due on any long term obligations or any off balance sheet items other than the loan commitments and unused lines of credit noted above 
the ots requires that the bank meet minimum tangible  core and risk based capital requirements

the company is considered well capitalized as of december  recent accounting pronouncements see footnote of consolidated financial statements on page f lending portfolio general 
the primary source of income to the company is interest from lending activities and mortgage backed and other investment securities 
the principal lending activity of the company is originating first mortgage real estate loans to enable borrowers to purchase or refinance one to two family residential properties and  to a lesser extent  originating home equity and other consumer loans 
management considers its purchase of loans and mortgage backed securities to be part of its lending activities and an alternative to originating loans 
loan portfolio composition 
at december   the company had total loans of million  of which million  or  were one to four family first mortgage loans 
the loan portfolio increased by million over the balance of million at december  the increase was primarily attributable to the origination and purchase of new loans as the company began a more aggressive marketing program in conjunction with its planned franchise expansion 
of the one to four family first mortgage loans outstanding at december   were arm loans and were fixed rate loans 
non residential real estate and multi family mortgage loans outstanding at december   totalled million  or of total loans  and million  or of total loans  respectively 
the remainder of the bank s loans at december   consisted of consumer loans of million  or of total loans  primarily home equity and deposit account loans 
at december   of the gross loan portfolio had adjustable rates 
the types of loans that the company may originate are subject to federal and state law and regulations 
interest rates charged by the bank on loans are affected principally by the demand for such loans and the supply of money available for lending purposes and the rates offered by its competitors 
these factors are  in turn  affected by general and economic conditions  monetary policies of the federal government  including the federal reserve board  legislative tax policies and governmental budgetary matters

delinquent loans and foreclosed assets maintenance of asset quality is one of management s most important tasks 
management reviews delinquent loans on a continuous basis and the board of directors reviews delinquent loans monthly 
the company retains counsel experienced in real estate law and foreclosure procedures 
the level of non performing assets was million at december   as compared to million at december  at december   the company held one parcel of reo with a value of  a decrease of  or  from  at december  the decrease reflects management s continued efforts to resolve the company s non performing assets 
federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets such as debt and equity securities considered by the ots to be of lesser quality as substandard  doubtful  or loss assets 
an asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the savings institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard  with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions  and values  highly questionable and improbable 
assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted 
assets that do not expose the savings institution to risk sufficient to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories  but which possess some weaknesses  are required to be designated special mention by management 
loans designated as special mention are generally loans that have experienced past delinquencies or have exhibited some potential weaknesses that  if not corrected  could increase the level of risk in the future 
at december   the company had special mention loans of  these loans consist of loans with an average balance of  at december   the company had loans days or more past due of million  or of total loans
