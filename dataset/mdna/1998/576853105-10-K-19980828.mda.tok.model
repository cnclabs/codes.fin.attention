item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company was organized in october to become a holding company for matrix and petrotank 
the discussion and analysis presented below is of the consolidated financial statements of these companies and the company s other subsidiaries since the date of acquisition  including i tank supply  inc  ii after june   san luis  iii after december   colt  iv after june   heath  v after april   brown  and vi after june   gsc 
the company recognizes revenues from fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion accounting method which measures progress on an uncompleted contract based on the amount of costs incurred for such project compared with the total amount of costs expected to be incurred through the completion of the project 
revenues from cost plus fee contracts are recognized on the basis of costs incurred plus the estimated fee earned 
the company has experienced an increase in revenues during the last three fiscal years 
for fiscal  gsc was included for eleven and one half months 
all acquired companies  except gsc  were included for the full year for fiscal and amounts reported in this section have been adjusted to reflect the exclusion of operations of midwest which was discontinued in fiscal year revenue and net loss for midwest were  respectively and million for fiscal  and million for fiscal and and million for fiscal incremental revenues  gross profit and selling  general and administrative expenses attributable to the results of operations of gsc  which were not included in the prior years  are as follows in millions year ended may  revenues gross profit selling  general administrative expenses during the third quarter  the company adopted a plan to restructure its operations 
the company recorded a charge of million in connection with the restructuring see note to consolidated financial statements 
the company expects a continued demand for its services in the foreseeable future 
management believes that the percentage growth of its revenues for fiscal will be stronger than fiscal year the limitation to growth for the last three fiscal years was due to decreased demand for the company s services 
limitations on growth capacity also reflect the seasonal nature of the company s refinery turnaround activities  which creates pressure to expand the supervisory staff during the turnaround seasons 
the company continues to recruit  hire and train additional project engineers and project managers  and the company s ability to continue to grow will depend  in part  on its ability to continue this process  and a stronger demand for the company s services 
the company has expanded its construction services into general industrial projects in an effort to decrease the seasonal effects of refinery related project 
the company s quarterly results may tend to fluctuate from period to period  due primarily to the timing of turnarounds performed by the company 
generally  the company performs a substantial percentage of its turnaround projects in two periods february through may and september through november 
historically  these are the time periods when most refiners temporarily shutdown certain operating units for maintenance  repair or modification prior to changing their product mix in anticipation of a seasonal shift in product demand 
consequently  the company s second quarter ending november and its fourth quarter ending may typically include greater revenues from turnarounds than its first quarter or its third quarter 
results of operations the following table presents  for the periods indicated  the percentage relationship which certain items in the company s statement of operations bear to revenues  and the percentage increase or decrease in the dollar amount of such items 
the following data should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the company and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this form k

 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the statement changes the way public companies report segment information in annual financial statements and also requires companies to report selected segment information in interim financial reports to shareholders 
as the company operates in one industry segment  this statement will not change the company s financial reporting or disclosures

year impact the year issue creates a significant problem with business automation for businesses  government agencies  and all computer users 
a significant number of applications in use today use two digit years and can fail between now and january  state of readiness 
the company is sensitive to the growing concern associated with the inception of the new millennium and its impact on the business marketplace 
in an effort to retain its ability to provide on going quality products and services to its customers  the company is actively pursuing year compliance for all of its computer systems 
assessment 
the company is in the process of finalizing its inventory and assessment efforts  which includes comprehensive review of its business systems 
the company anticipates completion of this task no later than september  the assessment focuses on the identification of automated business areas and electronic processes 
based on assessment results  the company has determined that it will be required to modify  upgrade or replace only a limited number of its systems so that its business areas will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the company estimates the impact of year issues on non it systems to be less than and will have no material impact on the operations of the business 
non it systems include systems with embedded technology containing programmed instructions running via processor chips 
project timetable 
the company believes that with the planned modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operation problems for its computer systems 
the company has minimal third party interface systems  however  communications have been initiated with significant suppliers and large customers to determine the extent to which the company s systems are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
the company estimates that it has completed approximately of the inventory and assessment activities 
of the systems identified  have been remediated  and solutions implemented into the production environment 
the company expects that the remaining systems will be upgraded  tested and implemented by the second quarter of  which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
anticipated cost 
the anticipated costs of the year project has been estimated at thousand  of which approximately will be capitalized 
the remaining will be expensed as incurred and is not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations 
any non compliant hardware is dated and would ordinarily be scheduled for replacement 
contingency plans 
despite the best planning and execution efforts  the company is working from the premise that some issues will not be uncovered  and that some issues that are uncovered will not be successfully resolved 
in an effort to manage and mitigate this risk exposure  the company is developing a risk management and contingency plan for its critical operations 
the company anticipates completion of this task no later than november  in addition to the upgrade strategy  the company has recently completed a requirements study for the selection and implementation of a new enterprise wide management information system 
the scope of this project has been maintained separately and independent of the year efforts 
the project is designed to be a full replacement for the financial and operational systems  and is scheduled for implementation in mid if the existing upgrade strategy fails  this project could be escalated to mitigate any material business disruptions 
while the company believes its efforts are adequate to address its year issues  there can be no guarantee that all year issues will be anticipated and corrected and that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems and operations rely will be converted on a timely basis  failure of all significant year issues to be corrected could have a material adverse effect on the company 
certain factors influencing results and accuracy of forward looking statements this annual report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of discussions containing such forward looking statements may be found in the material set forth under business and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as within the annual report generally 
in addition  when used in this annual report  the words believes  anticipates  expects and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
in the normal course of its business  the company  in an effort to help keep it shareholders and the public informed about the company s operations  may from time to time issue certain statements  either in writing or orally  that contain or may contain forward looking information 
generally  these statements relate to business plans or strategies  projected or anticipated benefits or other consequences of such plans or strategies  or projections involving anticipated revenues  earnings or other aspects of operating results 
such forward looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
as noted elsewhere in this annual report  all phases of the company s operations are subject to a number of uncertainties  risks and other influences  many of which are beyond the control of the company  and any one of which  or a combination of which  could materially affect the results of the company s operations and whether forward looking statements made by the company ultimately prove to be accurate 
the following discussion outlines certain factors that in the future could affect the company s consolidated results and cause them to differ materially from those that may be set forth in any forward looking statement made by or on behalf of the company 
the company cautions the reader  however  that this list of risk factors may not be exhaustive 
competition 
the company competes with numerous large and small companies  some of which have greater financial and other resources than the company 
competition within both the aboveground storage tank and hydrocarbon process services business is intense and is based on quality of service  price  safety considerations and availability of personnel 
see business other business matters competition 
market factors 
the company is dependent on the petroleum storage operations of the petroleum industry  and a downturn in that industry could negatively affect its operations 
the company s hydrocarbon processing operations focus primarily on the refining industry 
the refining industry has undergone significant changes in the past decade with respect to product composition  costs of petroleum products  and refinery capacity and utilization 
although the company believes that these changes in the industry have positively affected its business  changes could occur that decrease the industry s dependence on the type of services the company provides 
see business aboveground storage tank operations hydrocarbon process services 
availability of supervisory personnel 
the company employs in its operations project supervisors with substantial experience and training 
the growth of the business will depend on  and may be restricted by  its ability to retain these personnel and to recruit and train additional supervisory employees 
the competition to recruit qualified supervisor staff is intense 
labor markets 
the operations of the company are labor intensive 
the company has employed up to workers for a single project  and some of the workers employed by the company are represented by labor unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements 
although the company has to date been able to employ sufficient labor to complete its projects  changes in labor market conditions could restrict the availability of workers or increase the cost of such labor  either of which could adversely affect the company 
in addition  the operations of the company could be adversely affected by a strike or work stoppage 
see business other business matters employees 
fluctuations in quarterly results 
the operating results of hydrocarbon process services may be subject to significant quarterly fluctuations  affected primarily by the timing of planned maintenance projects at customers facilities 
generally  the company s turnaround projects are undertaken in two primary periods february through may and september through november when refineries typically shut down certain operating units to make changes to adjust to seasonal shifts in product demand 
as a result  the company s quarterly operating results can fluctuate materially 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the company 
environmental regulation 
the operations of the company have been affected positively by the promulgation of more stringent environmental laws and more stringent enforcement of existing laws 
although the company s future business success is not dependent on increased environmental regulation  decreased regulation and enforcement could adversely affect the demand for the services provided by the company 
see business ast market and regulatory background other business matters 
potential liability and insurance 
the operations of the company involve the use of heavy equipment and exposure to construction hazards  with attendant significant risks of liability for personal injury and property damage 
while the company believes that it operates safely and prudently  there can be no assurance that accidents will not occur or that the company will not incur substantial liability in connection with the operation of its business 
in addition  recent accidents within the refining and petrochemical industries may result in additional regulation of independent contractors serving those industries 
see business other business matters regulation 
the company maintains workers compensation insurance  general liability insurance and auto liability insurance  but such insurance is subject to coverage limits of million per accident or occurrence 
the company also maintains an umbrella policy with coverage limits of million in the aggregate 
such insurance includes coverage for losses or liabilities relating to environmental damage or pollution 
although the company believes that it conducts its operations prudently and that it minimizes its exposure to such risks  the company could be materially adversely affected by a claim that was not covered or only partially covered by insurance
