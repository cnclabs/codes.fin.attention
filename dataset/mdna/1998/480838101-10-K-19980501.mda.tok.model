realization of the future tax benefits of the nols is dependent on the company s ability to generate taxable income within the carryforward period

the average minimum taxable income that the company would need to generate prior to the expiration of the nols would be less than the average taxable income that the company earned during fiscal years and  as adjusted for unusual charges

the company will continue to evaluate the likelihood of future profit and the necessity of future adjustments to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
no assurance can be given that sufficient taxable income will be generated for full utilization of the nols
