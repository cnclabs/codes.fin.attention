overview the shoe manufacturing and importing operations of the company were permanently discontinued in the first quarter of  and the operations of the company following the merger  which was consummated on november   consist solely of the fragrance operations of ffi  which was the accounting acquiror in the merger 
therefore  the following discussion and analysis relates to the results of operation of ffi until the merger and the financial condition and results of operation of the company following the merger 
the company s business is the manufacturing  distribution and marketing of prestige fragrances and related cosmetic products 
the company distributes and markets on an exclusive basis in the united states to both department stores and mass market retailers the controlled brands  including  the geoffrey beene brands of grey flannel  eau de grey flannel and bowling green  the halston brands of halston  catalyst  z and  and several other brands including colors of benetton  hot and cold  tribu  ombre rose  ombre d or  faconnable  salvador dali  salvador  laguna  dalissime  dalimix  cafe  taxi  watt  balenciaga  rumba  lapidus  creation  fantasme and chevignon  as well as the galenic elancyl skin care products 
in the case of the halston and geoffrey beene fragrance brands  the company also controls the manufacturing and exclusive worldwide distribution of such brands 
in addition to the controlled brand operations  the company also distributes  primarily to mass market retailers  distributed brands it obtains from manufacturers and other sources 
the controlled brand operations have somewhat different financial characteristics than the distributed brand operations 
as a percentage of net sales  the controlled brand operations tend to have higher gross margins  as well as higher marketing and selling  general and administrative expenses  than the distributed brand operations 
the higher gross margins have been greater than the higher marketing and selling  general and administrative expenses associated with the controlled brand operations 
the acquisition of the licenses and trademarks associated with the controlled brand operations also increases amortization expense 
overall  brand contribution margin operating income after amortization of acquisition costs and amortization of exclusive brand licenses  as a percentage of net sales of controlled brands is greater than that of distributed brands 
the jpf acquisition  which closed on march   is anticipated to increase the proportion of the company s business in distributed brands

the following discussion of the company s and ffi s prior to the merger results of operations is presented for the fiscal years ended january   and results of operations general the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain information relating to the company s and ffi prior to the merger operations expressed as percentages of net sales for the period percentages may not add due to rounding years ended january  income statement data net sales cost of sales gross profit warehouse and shipping expenses selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization operating income interest expense  net of interest and other income income before equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate and income taxes equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income other data ebitda ebitda is defined as operating income  plus depreciation and amortization 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to operating income loss or net income loss as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as a measure of the company s operating performance or to net cash provided by operating  investing and financing activities as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as a measure of its ability to meet cash needs 
the company believes that ebitda is a measure commonly reported and widely used by investors and other interested parties in the fragrance industry as a measure of a fragrance company s operating performance and debt servicing ability because it assists in comparing performance on a consistent basis without regard to depreciation and amortization  which can vary significantly depending upon accounting methods particularly when acquisitions are involved or nonoperating factors such as historical cost 
accordingly  this information has been disclosed herein to permit a more complete comparative analysis of the company s operating performance relative to other companies in the fragrance industry and of the company s debt servicing ability 
however  ebitda may not be comparable in all instances to other similar types of measures used in the fragrance industry

seasonality the fragrance operations of the company have historically been seasonal  with higher sales generally occurring in the second half of the fiscal year as a result of increased demand by retailers in anticipation of and during the holiday season 
for example  in fiscal  of the company s net sales were made during the second half of the fiscal year 
due to the size and timing of certain orders from its customers  sales and results of operations can vary significantly between quarters of the same and different years 
as a result  the company expects to experience variability in net sales and net income on a quarterly basis 
the company s working capital borrowings are also seasonal  and are normally highest in the months of september and october 
during the fourth fiscal quarter ending january  significant cash is normally generated as customer payments on holiday orders are received 
liquidity and capital resources the company used approximately million of net cash in operations during the fiscal year ended january   compared to million of net cash used in operations during the fiscal year ended january   primarily as a result of a significant decrease in accounts payable partially offset by a decrease in the level of inventory purchases 
the company utilized a portion of the proceeds from the note offering to significantly reduce its accounts payable 
the company used net cash in investing activities of approximately million during the fiscal year ended january   compared to approximately million during the fiscal year ended january   primarily as a result of the cash used for purchases of brand licenses and trademarks for the halston acquisition and the fmg acquisition during fiscal  partially offset by significant additions to property and equipment for the miami lakes facility  including for a new racking system  a computerized pick sortation system and computer software and equipment associated with a new management information system 
during the fiscal year ended january   the company received approximately million of net cash from financing activities  which related to the proceeds from the may note offering and the uses of a portion of such proceeds to pay off the outstanding balances under the company s credit facility and certain subordinated debentures and for working capital purposes 
during the fiscal year ended january   the company received approximately million of net cash from financing activities  primarily to fund the halston acquisition  the fmg acquisition and for working capital purposes 
the company financed these activities through the public offering of common stock in july  the issuance of subordinated debentures  the mortgage on the miami lakes facility and the revolving portion of its credit facility 
see notes  and to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company and ffi prior to the merger has historically financed  and expects to continue to finance  its internal growth and acquisitions primarily through its credit facility  external financing and internally generated funds 
the company s principal future uses of funds are for working capital requirements  debt service and additional brand acquisitions or product distribution arrangements 
as a result of several acquisitions during the past three years  including the geoffrey beene acquisition  the halston acquisition and the fmg acquisition  the growth in direct distribution relationships for additional fragrance brands and certain favorable product buying opportunities  the company s working capital needs have increased significantly and are expected to continue to increase  especially following the closing of the jpf acquisition 
the company financed approximately million of the purchase price not including the accounts payable assumed for the jpf acquisition with available cash from operations  the company s revolving credit facility with fleet the credit facility and the million debenture 
the debenture is non interest bearing  with the principal amount being payable in three equal annual installments if certain conditions relating to the jpf business are achieved by the company  including achieving certain gross profit thresholds from the jpf business 
see item business recent developments 
since a significant portion of the purchase price for the jpf acquisition was paid from the credit facility  management of the company is evaluating alternatives for additional external financing of million  which may be debt or equity financing  to pay down the amounts borrowed under the credit facility 
management of the company believes that such financing or other financing such as an increase in the size of the credit facility is  and will be  available 
subject to receipt of financing to pay down and thereby create availability under the credit facility  management of the company believes that internally generated funds and available financing under the credit facility will be sufficient to cover the company s working capital and debt service requirements other than any additional working capital requirements which may result from further expansion  through acquisitions of brands or new product distribution arrangements  of the company s operations for at least the next months 
the company s future liquidity will continue to be dependent upon its relative amounts of current assets principally cash  accounts receivable and inventories and current liabilities principally short term debt  accrued expenses and accounts payable 
additional inventory requirements and accounts receivable can have a significant impact on the company s liquidity  particularly during expansion 
to date  the company generally has not experienced any material adverse problems with the collection of accounts receivable relating to its fragrance operations 
there can be no assurance that refusals to pay or delays in payment would not have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity  results of operations and general financial condition in the future 
the company establishes reserves and provides allowances for returns at the time of sale  but there can be no assurance that such reserves and allowances will be adequate 
further expansion of the company s operations  including through additional brand acquisitions or the acquisition of exclusive distribution rights to additional fragrance brands  will require increased investment in accounts receivable and inventories  which may negatively impact the company s cash flow from operations 
the company has discussions from time to time with manufacturers of prestige fragrance brands and with distributors that hold exclusive distribution rights regarding possible acquisitions by the company of additional exclusive manufacturing and or distribution rights 
the company currently has no agreements or commitments with respect to any such acquisition  although it periodically executes routine agreements to maintain the confidentiality of information obtained during the course of discussions with manufacturers and distributors 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to negotiate successfully for any such future acquisitions or that it will be able to obtain acquisition financing or additional working capital financing on satisfactory terms for further expansion of its operations

there is no assurance that any such sale or lease will be consummated 
impact of inflation and foreign exchange fluctuations the company believes that although inflation has not had a material impact on its results of operations  inflation would likely increase the interest rates that the company pays on its floating rate indebtedness 
although large fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could have a material effect on the prices the company pays for certain products it purchases from outside of the united states  the prices obtainable for sales denominated in foreign currencies and wholesale sales to foreign customers  such fluctuations have not been material to the company s results of operations to date
