item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional risks associated with the company having a significant portion of total revenues derived internationally 
cadence is required to have united states department of commerce export licenses for shipment of its products outside the united states to certain countries and certain end users 
although to date  cadence has not encountered any material difficulty in obtaining these licenses  any difficulty in obtaining necessary export licenses in the future could have an adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
research and development for the years   and  respectively  cadence s investment in research and development was million  million  and million prior to capitalizing million  million  and million of software development costs 
see notes to consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of cadence s capitalization of certain software development costs 
cadence is currently developing technology that it will introduce to the eda market in and beyond 
among the primary areas that cadence is addressing are soc design  the design of silicon devices in the deep sub micron range  high speed board design  architectural level design  high performance logic verification technology  and hardware software co design 
the industry in which the company competes is subject to rapid technological developments  evolving industry standards  changes in customer requirements  and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
as a result  the company s success  in part  depends upon its ability  on a cost effective and timely basis  to continue to enhance its existing solutions and to develop and introduce new solutions that improve performance  and reduce total cost of ownership 
in order to achieve these objectives  the company s management and engineering personnel work closely with customers  to identify and respond to customer needs  as well as with other innovators of design products  including universities  laboratories  and corporations 
the company will also continue to make strategic acquisitions and equity investments where appropriate 
still  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully develop new products to address new customer requirements and technological changes  or that such products will achieve market acceptance 
cadence s advanced research and development group  cadence laboratories  is committed to new technological development 
this group is chartered with identifying and developing prototype technologies in emerging design areas which will offer substantially improved alternatives to current eda solutions 
competition the company operates in the highly competitive eda industry and in the emerging commercial electronic design and consulting markets 
the eda industry continues to be characterized by falling prices  rapid technological change  and new market entrants 
the company s success is dependent upon its ability to develop innovative  cost competitive eda software products and bring them to market in a timely manner 
the company competes with a number of companies including avant corporation  mentor graphics corp  synopsys  inc  and zuken redac 
the company also experiences competition from manufacturers of electronic devices that have the capability to develop their own eda software 
some of these companies may have substantially greater financial  marketing  and technological resources than the company 
the eda industry has relatively low barriers to entry and  therefore  the number of the company s actual and potential competitors is significant 
a potential competitor who possesses the necessary knowledge of electronic circuit and systems design  production  and operations could develop competitive eda tools using a moderately priced computer workstation and bring such tools to market quickly 
there can be no assurance that development of competitive products will not result in a shift of customer preferences away from the company s products  resulting in a significant decrease in the sales of the company s comparable products 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will successfully identify new product opportunities  develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner  and achieve market acceptance of its products 
in the electronic design and consulting markets  the company competes with numerous consulting companies 
this emerging market represents the outsourcing of an activity by electronic manufacturers that has traditionally been performed in house  and is thus subject to the customers make versus buy decisions 
therefore  the company s ability to obtain such business is dependent upon its ability to offer better strategic concepts and technical solutions  lower prices  a quicker response  or a combination of these factors 
there can be no assurance the company will be able to effectively compete in this area and any failure to compete in this area may have a material adverse effect on cadence s business  operating results  and financial condition 
the electronic design and consulting service businesses have relatively low barriers to entry and  therefore  eda and other electronics companies and management consulting firms have entered and may continue to enter into this market 
the pricing model for services is susceptible to labor supply and demand as well as the company s continuing ability to provide competitive time to market benefits to its customers 
some of the company s current and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial  marketing  and technological resources than the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully 
proprietary technology cadence s success is dependent  in part  upon its proprietary technology 
the company generally relies upon patents  copyrights  trademarks  and trade secret laws to establish and maintain its proprietary rights in its technology and products 
cadence has a program to file applications for and obtain patents in the united states and in selected foreign countries where a potential market for cadence s products exists 
cadence has been issued a number of patents  other patent applications are currently pending 
there can be no assurance that any of these patents will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that any rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to cadence 
in addition  there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications  or that claims allowed on any future patents will be sufficiently broad to protect cadence s technology 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries may not permit the protection of cadence s proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
although cadence believes the protection afforded by its patents  patent applications  copyrights  and trademarks has value  the rapidly changing technology in the eda industry makes cadence s future success dependent primarily on the innovative skills  technological expertise  and management abilities of its employees rather than on patent  copyright  and trademark protection 
many of cadence s products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties 
while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products  cadence believes that based upon past experience and standard industry practice  such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms 
because of the existence of a large number of patents in the eda industry and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents  it is not economically practical to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringe patent rights of others 
from time to time  cadence receives notices from or is sued by third parties regarding patent claims 
if infringement is alleged  cadence believes that  based upon industry practice  any necessary license or rights under such patents may be obtained on terms that would not have a material adverse effect on cadence s business  operating results  and financial condition 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms  if at all  or that cadence would prevail in any such challenge 
the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms  or the need to engage in litigation could have a material adverse effect on cadence s business  operating results  and financial condition 
manufacturing cadence s software production operations consist of configuring the proper version of a product  outsourcing the recording of the product on magnetic tape or cd rom  and producing customer unique access keys which allow customers to use licensed products 
user manuals and other documentation are generally available on cd rom  but are occasionally supplied in hard copy format 
shipments are generally made within two weeks of receiving an order 
the company has generally been able to obtain adequate manufacturing supplies in a timely manner from existing sources  or where necessary  from alternative sources of supply 
a reduction or interruption in supply or a significant increase in the price of one or more components would adversely affect the company s business  operating results  and financial condition and could damage customer relationships 
employees as of february   cadence employed  persons including  in sales  marketing  support  and manufacturing activities   in product development  and in management  administration  and finance 
none of cadence s employees is represented by labor unions  and cadence has experienced no work stoppages 
cadence believes that its employee relations are good 
competition in recruiting of personnel in the software industry is intense 
cadence believes that its future success will depend in part on its continued ability to recruit  assimilate  and retain highly skilled management  marketing  and technical personnel 
to date  the company believes that it has been successful in recruiting qualified employees  but there is no assurance that it will continue to be successful in the future

cadence also leases approximately  square feet of facilities in chelmsford  massachusetts and approximately  square feet in sunnyvale  california 
in  the company anticipates leasing a new design factory in rancho bernardo  california  with an estimated square footage of approximately  square feet 
cadence believes that these facilities and the undeveloped land adjacent to its current headquarters are adequate for its current needs and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate expansion of the company s operations 
item legal proceedings from time to time the company is involved in various disputes and litigation matters which arise in the ordinary course of business 
these include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property  licensing  contract law  distribution arrangements  and employee relations matters 
the company filed a complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of california on december  against avant corporation avant and certain of its employees for misappropriation of trade secrets  copyright infringement  conspiracy  and other illegalities 
on january   avant filed various counterclaims against the company and the company s former president and chief executive officer  and with leave of the court  on january  filed a second amended counterclaim 
the second amended counterclaim alleges  inter alia  that the company and its former president and chief executive officer had cooperated with the santa clara county district attorney and initiated and pursued its complaint against avant for anticompetitive reasons  engaged in wrongful activity in an attempt to manipulate avant s stock price  and utilized certain pricing policies and other acts to unfairly compete against avant in the marketplace 
the second amended counterclaim also alleges that certain company insiders engaged in illegal insider trading with respect to avant s stock 
the company and its former president and chief executive officer believe that each has meritorious defenses to avant s claims  and each intends to defend such action vigorously 
by an order dated july   the court bifurcated avant s counterclaim from the company s complaint 
the second amended counterclaim remains severed from the company s complaint and stayed pending resolution of the company s complaint 
on april   the company filed a motion seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent further use of cadence copyrighted code and trade secrets by avant 
on march   the district court issued an order in which it granted in part and denied in part that motion 
on september   the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed the district court s decision and directed the district court a to issue an order enjoining the sale of avant s arccell products and b to determine whether avant s aquarius software infringes cadence s code and  if so  to enter an order enjoining the sale of that software 
on february   avant filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the united states supreme court  requesting a review of the ninth circuit court s decision 
in an order issued on december   as modified on january   the district court entered an injunction barring any further infringement of cadence s copyrights in design framework ii software  or selling  licensing or copying such product derived from design framework ii  including but not limited to  avant s arccell products 
the company s motion for an injunction covering avant s aquarius product line remains pending before the district court 
by an order dated july   the district court stayed most activity in the case pending in that court and ordered avant to post a million bond  in light of criminal proceedings pending against avant and several of its executives 
the district court has not yet set a trial date for the civil proceedings 
the company intends to pursue its claim vigorously

if ims s costs had been excluded from the costs incurred in  and cct s costs  prior to the acquisition date  had been included in and early  cost of product would have increased million or from to the increase was primarily driven by additional costs incurred for the company s new european manufacturing facility  increases in software amortization  and royalty expenses 
on the same basis  cost of revenue as a percent of product sales would have been in the decreases in cost of product as a percentage of product revenue in  as compared to  and in  as compared to  were primarily due to revenues growing at a faster rate than costs 
the increase in cost of product in absolute dollars in  as compared to  was primarily due to increased purchased software amortization and the write off of million of capitalized software development costs related to products at the end of their life cycle 
cost of services revenue includes personnel and related costs associated with providing services to customers and the infrastructure to manage a services organization  as well as costs to recruit  develop  and retain services professionals

other income and expense other income expense for   and is as follows in millions interest income gain on sale of ims stock equity earnings in ims minority interest expense gain loss on foreign exchange interest expense other expense  net total other income expense interest income increased in  as compared to  by million  primarily due to higher average cash and investment balances throughout the decrease in  as compared to  was primarily attributable to prevailing interest rates being lower in  as compared to in  an million gain was recorded on the sale of approximately of the stock of ims  then a previously wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
in  the company sold additional shares of ims for a million gain  thereby reducing its ownership to approximately 
as a result  the company began reporting its share of ims earnings using the equity method of accounting  which generated million in equity income in  and reduced minority interest expense by million in  as compared to the increase in minority interest expense in  as compared to  was due to higher minority interest expense associated with ims and a japanese subsidiary 
the loss on foreign exchange increased in  as compared to  due to unfavorable volatile asian currencies  primarily the japanese yen and korean won

the valuation allowance provision for income taxes decreased by million due to the realization of net operating losses and tax credits generated in prior years 
although realization is not assured  management believes that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized 
the amount of the net deferred tax assets  however  could be reduced or increased in the near term if actual facts  including the estimate of future taxable income  differ from those estimated 
the effective tax rate of for was lower than the effective tax rate in due primarily to foreign earnings  which were taxed at lower rates 
the effective tax rate of excluded the write off of million for in process research and development costs associated with the hlds acquisition  which was not deductible for tax purposes 
the increase in the effective tax rate  as compared to the effective tax rate  was primarily due to an increase in state income taxes and a smaller reduction in the valuation allowance 
disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio 
the company places its investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer

under this program  increases or decreases in the company s foreign currency transactions are partially offset by gains and losses on the forward contracts  so as to mitigate the possibility of short term earnings volatility 
the company does not use forward contracts for trading purposes 
all outstanding forward contracts at the end of a period are marked to market with unrealized gains and losses included in other income expense  and thus are recognized in income in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows 
as these forward contracts mature  the realized gains and losses are recorded and are included in net income as a component of other income expense
