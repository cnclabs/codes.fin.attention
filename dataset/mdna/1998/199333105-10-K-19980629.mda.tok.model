inflation and other market conditions the company s costs are affected by inflation in the us economy  and to a lesser extent  in foreign economies including those of europe  canada  mexico  and the pacific rim 
the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on results of operations over the periods presented because of low inflation levels over the periods and because the company has generally been able to pass on rising costs through price increases 
however  in the future there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation or that it will be able to pass on cost increases 
seasonality and quarterly results lower than average orders and shipments during the december holiday period have a slight effect on the company 
in addition  quarterly results may be materially affected by the timing of large customer orders  by periods of high vacation concentrations  and by acquisitions and the magnitude of acquisition costs 
therefore  the operating results for any particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for the full fiscal year
