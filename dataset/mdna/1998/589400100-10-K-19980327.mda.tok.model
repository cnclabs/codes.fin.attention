item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the operating results of property and casualty insurance companies are subject to significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter and from year to year due to the effect of competition on pricing  the frequency and severity of losses  including the effect of natural disasters on losses  general economic conditions  the general regulatory environment in those states in which an insurer operates  state regulation of premium rates and other factors such as changes in tax laws 
the property and casualty industry has been highly cyclical  with periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity followed by periods of severe price competition and excess capacity 
the company did business only in the state of california until  when it began operations in georgia and illinois 
in december  the american fidelity insurance group afi  now american mercury insurance group ami  was acquired for cash 
the results of operations of ami for the month of december only are included in the company s consolidated statement of income 
the full year results of ami for are included in the company s consolidated statement of income 
ami writes automobile approximately of ami s direct premiums and other casualty lines of insurance principally in oklahoma  texas and kansas  and is headquartered in oklahoma city  oklahoma 
total direct premiums written by ami in were million 
total direct premiums written by ami in were million  of that amount million of premiums were written in december and included in the results of operations of the company in ami is licensed in states 
in early  the company also commenced operations in florida 
during  approximately of the company s direct premiums written  including ami  were derived from california 
in california  as in various other states  all property and casualty rates must be approved by the insurance commissioner before they can be used 
in february  the california insurance commissioner approved new rates which were designed to improve the company s competitive position for new insureds 
these rate changes  which became effective on may   provided for decreases in premium rates for new insureds 
further rate modifications were approved and made effective on october   april  and october  the rate changes made over the last several years have been substantially revenue neutral overall  with physical damage rates being increased and bodily injury liability rates decreased 
the rate changes have resulted in a substantial increase in new business being submitted to the company 
since march   private passenger automobile ppa policies in force in california have increased by approximately  to  at december   an annual rate of increase of over 
in september  the california insurance commissioner issued new permanent rating factor regulations designed to implement the requirements that automobile insurance rates be determined by driving safety record  years of driving experience  miles driven per year and whatever optional factors are determined by the insurance commissioner to have a substantial relationship to the risk of loss and adopted by regulation 
the law further requires that each of the four factors be applied in decreasing order of importance 
the new permanent regulations replaced emergency regulations which had been in use since their issuance in the new regulations required all automobile insurers in california to submit new rating plans complying with the regulations in early the company submitted its new proposed rating plan on march  the company s plan  and the new plans of most other california automobile insurers  were approved by the california doi in october the company s plan became effective november  although the rate changes produced some minor dislocations  implementation of the new plan has not thus far had a material effect on the company s overall competitive position or its profitability 
in february  the company filed new reduced rates with the california doi 
the overall rate reduction of approximately will become effective on april  results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  premiums earned in of  million including million contributed by ami increased  primarily reflecting unit growth 
average premium per policy for the year declined slightly 
net premiums written in of  million including million contributed by ami increased over a year earlier  continuing a growth trend which began in the second quarter of growth in written premiums in california of for all of was aided by a new california law that became effective january  which requires proof of insurance for the registration new or renewal of a motor vehicle 
the greater part of the new business generated by the new law occurred in the first half of  and provided for only the minimum liability coverage required by law 
the average premium on this business was substantially less than that produced by full coverage policies  which constitute a majority of the company s total premium volume 
the loss ratio in loss and loss adjustment expenses related to premiums earned was  compared with in the improvement in loss experience in is in large part related to the effectiveness of proposition  an initiative passed by a large majority of california voters in november which prohibits recovery of non economic losses by uninsured motorists or drunk drivers injured in automobile accidents 
the loss ratio reflects deficiencies from unfavorable development on allocated loss adjustment expenses from prior periods 
the initial estimates were based principally on the company s actual experience and did not fully reflect the increases in the legal expenses of defending the company s insureds arising from the company s policy of aggressively defending  including litigating  exaggerated bodily injury claims arising from minimal impact automobile accidents 
the expense ratio policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses related to premiums earned was in and the increase in the expense ratio in reflects increased provisions for profit related bonuses to both agents and employees and the inclusion of the operating results of ami for a full year 
total losses and expenses in  excluding interest expense of million  were million  resulting in an underwriting gain for the period of million  compared with an underwriting gain of million in investment income in  including a contribution from ami of million  was million  compared with million in the after tax yield on average investments of  million  including ami  fixed maturities at cost  equities at market was  compared with on average investments of million in the effective tax rate on investment income was in  compared with in the effective tax rate was increased  and the effective after tax yield was reduced slightly  by the inclusion of ami for the full year the slightly higher tax rate on investment income in reflects an increase in the proportion of investment income derived from taxable bonds held by ami and dividends on equities  principally perpetual preferred stocks 
the redemption of bonds acquired during higher interest periods has been a negative influence on realized yields in each of the last several years and will continue in bonds matured and called in totaled million  compared with million in approximately million of bonds are expected to mature or be called in average yields being obtained during the first quarter of on new investments are to basis points lower than the average yield realized in realized investment gains in were million  compared with realized losses of million in the gains and losses in both years reflect principally income enhancing swaps of both fixed maturities and equity securities  including perpetual preferred stocks 
the losses realized in were designed to utilize expiring capital gains tax benefits 
the income tax provision of million in represented an effective tax rate of  compared with an effective rate of in the increase in the rate is attributable to the increased proportion of realized gains and the increase in underwriting gains  both of which are taxed at the full corporate rate of  in contrast to investment income which consists primarily of tax exempt interest and tax sheltered dividend income 
net income in was million  or per share  basic  compared with million  or per share  basic  in basic share results are based on million average shares in and million average shares in  adjusted for a two for one stock split effective september  diluted per share results  calculated in accordance with new accounting standards  were in and in year ended december  compared to year ended december  premiums earned in of million including million contributed by ami in december increased over premiums earned in  primarily reflecting unit growth 
average premium per policy for the year was substantially unchanged 
net premiums written in of million including million contributed by ami increased over a year earlier  continuing a growth trend which began in the second quarter of the loss ratio in was  compared with in the and loss ratios reflect small contributions from favorable loss reserve development from prior periods 
the expense ratio was in and the consolidation of one month of operating results of ami in had no material effect on either the loss or expense ratios 
total losses and expenses in  excluding interest expense of million  were million  resulting in an underwriting gain for the period of million  compared with an underwriting gain of million in investment income in  including a contribution from ami of  for the final month of the year  was million  compared with million in the after tax yield on average investments of million  including ami  was  compared with on average investments of million in the effective tax rate on investment income was in  compared with in the effective tax rate was increased and the effective after tax yield was reduced slightly by the inclusion of ami for the month of december the effective tax rate on investment income in  excluding ami  was  and the after tax yield was 
the slightly higher tax rate on investment income in reflects an increase in the proportion of investment income derived from dividends on equities  principally perpetual preferred stocks 
bonds matured and called in totaled million  compared with million in average yields obtained during on new investments were approximately some basis points lower than the average yield realized in realized investment losses in were million  compared with realized gains of million in the losses reflect principally yield enhancing swaps of both fixed maturities and equity securities  including perpetual preferred stocks  designed to utilize expiring capital gains tax benefits 
the gains arose in part from the early redemption of fixed maturity investments 
the income tax provision of million in represented an effective tax rate of  compared with an effective rate of  in the increase in the rate is attributable principally to the greater contribution from underwriting gains  which are fully taxable and increased by million during  whereas the predominantly tax free investment income increased million 
net income in was million  or per share basic  compared with million  or per share basic  in basic per share results are based on million average shares in and million average shares in adjusted for a two for one stock split effective september  diluted per share results  calculated in accordance with new accounting standards  were in and in liquidity and capital resources net cash provided from operating activities in  was million  while funds derived from the sale  redemption or maturity of investments was million  of which approximately was represented by the sale of equity securities 
the amortized cost of fixed maturity investments increased by million during the year 
equity investments  including perpetual preferred stocks  increased by million at cost  while short term cash investments decreased by million 
the amortized cost of fixed maturities available for sale that were sold  called or matured during the year was million 
the market value of all investments held at market as available for sale exceeded the amortized cost of  million at december  by million 
that unrealized gain  reflected in shareholders equity net of applicable tax effects  was million at december  compared with an unrealized gain of million at december  the increase in market values since december  reflects principally the substantial decline in intermediate and long term interest rates during the company s cash and short term investments totaled million at december  together with funds generated internally  such liquid assets are more than adequate to pay claims without the sale of long term investments 
traditionally  it has been the company s policy not to invest in high yield or junk bonds 
in  the company adopted a policy to place a small proportion of its investments in the taxable sector in bonds rated lower than investment grade  but not lower than ba by moody s or bb by standard poor s 
at december  bond holdings rated below investment grade totaled million at market cost million  or of total investments 
the average rating of the  million bond portfolio at amortized cost was aa  while the average effective maturity  giving effect to anticipated early call  approximates years 
the modified duration of the bond portfolio at year end was years  reflecting the heavy weighting of high coupon issues  including housing issues subject to sinking funds  and other issues which are pre refunded or are expected to be called prior to their maturity 
duration measures the length of time it takes to receive all the cash flows produced by a bond  including reinvestment of interest 
because it measures four factors maturity  coupon rate  yield and call terms which determine sensitivity to changes in interest rates  modified duration is a much better indicator of price volatility than simple maturity alone 
bond holdings are broadly diversified geographically  and  within the tax exempt sector  consist largely of high coupon revenue issues  many of which have been pre refunded and escrowed with us treasuries 
general obligation bonds of the large eastern cities have generally been avoided 
holdings in the taxable sector consist largely of senior public utility issues 
fixed maturity investments of  million amortized cost  include million amortized cost of sinking fund preferreds  principally utility issues 
the market value of all fixed maturities exceeded cost by million at december  the only securities held which may be considered derivatives are a small amount of adjustable rate preferred stocks 
except for company occupied buildings  the company has no direct investments in real estate and no holdings of mortgages secured by commercial real estate 
equity holdings of million at market cost million  including perpetual preferred issues  are largely confined to the public utility and banking sectors and represent about of total shareholders equity 
the only significant debt of the company at december  was a three year   revolving credit bank loan 
the loan agreement requires the company to meet numerous affirmative and negative covenants 
the proceeds of the loan were used to repay a prior loan and to acquire ami  with the balance contributed to the company s new insurance subsidiaries 
the loan agreement may be extended annually for additional periods of one year each to maintain the three year maturity date 
the interest rate is variable and is optionally related to the federal funds rate  bank of new york rate prime rate or the eurodollar london interbank rate libor 
based on the rates effective through november   libor plus  the net interest cost on the loan approximates 
in march  the company s employee stock ownership plan the plan purchased  shares of mercury general s common stock in the open market at a price of per share  adjusted for the two for one stock split effective september  the purchases were funded by a five year term bank loan of million to the plan which is guaranteed by the company 
the shares have been allocated to employees over the amortization period of the loan  with the initial allocation made in december the remaining balance of the loan of million is being retired in march with the proceeds of contributions to the plan by the company for the year  and the remaining unallocated shares were credited to employees esop balances at december  a new million esop loan is currently being arranged with an amortization period of not more than five years 
the proceeds of that loan will be used to purchase the company s shares in the open market  with the shares to be allocated to employees over the amortization period beginning in december since dividends on unallocated shares held by the plan are tax deductible if they are used for debt service  as are company contributions to the plan  the net  after tax interest cost to the company for the borrowed funds used for the plan stock purchase is less than the nominal fixed rate of interest on the loan  which  in  was 
in december  the naic adopted a risk based capital formula for casualty insurance companies which establishes recommended minimum capital requirements for casualty companies 
the formula has been designed to capture the widely varying elements of risks undertaken by writers of different lines of insurance having differing risk characteristics  as well as writers of similar lines where differences in risk may be related to corporate structure  investment policies  reinsurance arrangements and a number of other factors 
the company has estimated the risk based capital requirements of each of its insurance subsidiaries as of december  each of the companies policyholders surplus exceeded the highest level of recommended capital requirements 
as of december   the company had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
industry and regulatory guidelines suggest that the ratio of a property and casualty insurer s annual net premiums written to statutory policyholders surplus should not exceed to based on the combined surplus of all of the licensed insurance subsidiaries of million at december   and net written premiums for the twelve months ended on that date of  million  the ratio of writings to surplus was approximately to year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  or as no date 
this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company is nearing completion of the modifications to its computer programs and systems to resolve the problems created by the impending year the conversion of the most critical systems should be completed within the first quarter of the cost of this conversion has been charged to current operations and will not have a material effect on the financial condition of the company 
while the year considerations are not expected to materially impact the company s internal operations  they may have an effect on some of the company s agents  suppliers and financial institutions with whom the company conducts business  and thus indirectly affect the company 
it is not possible to quantify the aggregate cost to the company with respect to external year problems  although the company does not anticipate it will have a material adverse impact on its business 
forward looking statements the foregoing discussion contains forward looking statements regarding the company  its business  prospects and results of operations that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties posed by factors and events that could cause the company s actual business  prospects and results of operations to differ materially from the historical information contained herein and from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  among others  the success of the company in integrating and profitably operating the business of ami  and in expanding generally in states outside of california  the impact of the permanent rating factor regulations recently adopted by the california insurance commissioner for private passenger automobile policies issued in california and the level of investment yields obtainable in the company s investment portfolio in comparison to recent yields  as well as the cyclical and competitive nature of the property and casualty insurance industry and general uncertainties regarding loss reserve estimates and legislative and regulatory changes 
such risks and uncertainties and other factors are discussed above and in periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission
