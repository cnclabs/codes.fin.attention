the number of shares to be issued are generally determined based upon the average price of the company s common stock during the five business days prior to the date of issuance 
as of january   the company had committed to issue million of common stock of the company using the methodology discussed above 
the company s acquisition and expansion programs will require substantial capital resources 
in addition  the operation of physician groups  integrated networks and related ancillary services companies  and the development and implementation of the company s management information systems  will require ongoing capital expenditures 
the company expects that its capital needs over the next several years will substantially exceed capital generated from operations 
to finance its capital needs  the company plans both to incur indebtedness and to issue  from time to time  additional debt or equity securities  including common stock or convertible notes  in connection with its acquisitions and affiliations 
in september  the company entered into a secured credit agreement with a bank providing for a million revolving line of credit for working capital and acquisition purposes 
the credit agreement i prohibits the payment of dividends by the company  ii limits the company s ability to incur indebtedness and make acquisitions except as permitted under the credit agreement and iii requires the company to comply with certain financial covenants 
the company expects that its working capital as of january  of million  which includes cash of million  and amounts available under an acquisition working capital line of credit for approximately million  will be adequate to satisfy the company s cash requirements for the next months 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to seek additional financing during this period 
the failure to raise the funds necessary to finance its future cash requirements would adversely affect the company s ability to pursue its strategy and could adversely affect its results of operations for future periods 
risks associated with year the year date change issue is believed to affect virtually all companies and organizations 
if not corrected  many computer applications and medical equipment could fail or create erroneous results by or at the year the company recognizes the need to ensure its operations will not be adversely impacted by the inability of the company s information systems to process data having dates on or after january  the year issues 
the company expects to complete its full assessment of the year issue no later than january   which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
as part of the year assessment  the company expects to communicate with all of its physician practices and networks  as well as suppliers and third parties with which the company does business  to determine the extent to which the company s interface systems are vulnerable to those parties failure to remedy their year issues 
there is no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company relies will be corrected in a timely manner or that the failure to correct will not have a material adverse effect on the company s systems 
the company does not believe that it will incur a material financial impact from the risk  or from assessing the risk  arising from the year issues 
however  there can be no guarantee that the company s initial assessment of the financial impact of this risk will be accurate  actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences  include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
factors to be considered the parts of this annual report on form k titled business  legal proceedings and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain certain forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
when used in this annual report on form k  the words may  will  seek  plan  expect  believe  anticipate  continue  estimate  project  intend and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act regarding events  conditions and financial trends that may affect the company s future plans of operations  business strategy  results of operations and financial position

the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update such forward looking statements 
risks related to growth strategy 
the company s strategy involves growth primarily through affiliation with physicians and acquisition of medical practices and other businesses 
the company is subject to various risks associated with its growth strategy  including the risk that the company will be unable to identify  recruit or acquire suitable affiliation or acquisition candidates or to integrate and manage the affiliated or acquired ipas  practices or companies 
the growth of the company is largely dependent on the company s ability to form networks of affiliated physicians and to manage and control costs 
any failure of the company to implement economically feasible affiliations and acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve and manage planned growth  that the assets of physician practice groups  ipas  hospitals or other healthcare providers will continue to be available for acquisition by the company  that the liabilities assumed by the company in any affiliation or acquisition will not have a material adverse effect on the company  or that the affiliation with physician practice groups  ipas  hospitals or other healthcare providers will be profitable for the company 
risks related to capital requirements 
the company s affiliation  acquisition and expansion programs may require substantial capital resources 
in addition  the operation of physician groups  ipas  integrated networks and related ancillary service companies requires ongoing capital expenditures 
further  in connection with certain of its affiliations  the company has obligated itself to provide significant amounts of capital to expand or improve the affiliated organization 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise additional capital when needed on satisfactory terms or at all 
any limitation on the company s ability to obtain additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the company 
risks related to acquisition financing 
the company has financed affiliations and acquisitions  and may choose to finance future affiliations and acquisitions  by using shares of its common stock for a portion or all of the consideration to be paid 
in the event that the common stock does not maintain a sufficient market value  or potential affiliation and acquisition candidates are otherwise unwilling to accept common stock as part of the consideration for the affiliation or acquisition  the company might not be able to utilize common stock as a consideration for affiliations and acquisitions and would be required to utilize more of its cash resources  if available  in order to maintain its affiliation and acquisition program 
if the company does not have sufficient cash resources  its growth could be limited unless it is able to obtain additional capital through debt or equity financings 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available if and when needed or on terms acceptable to the company 
government regulation 
providers of healthcare services  including physicians and other clinicians  are subject to extensive federal and state regulation 
the fraud and abuse provisions of the social security act prohibit the solicitation  payment  receipt or offering of any direct or indirect remuneration in return for  or the inducement of  the referral of patients  items or services that are paid for  in whole or in part  by medicare or medicaid 
these laws also impose significant penalties for false or improper billings for physician services and impose restrictions on physicians referrals for designated health services to entities with which they have financial relationships 
violations of these laws may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties for individuals or entities  including large civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs 
similar state laws also apply to the company 
such exclusion and penalties  if applied to the company s affiliated physician groups or medical support service providers  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the laws of many states prohibit business corporations such as the company from exercising control over the medical judgments or decisions of physicians and from engaging in certain financial arrangements  such as splitting fees with physicians 
these laws and their interpretations vary from state to state and are enforced by both the courts and regulatory authorities  each with broad discretion 
expansion of the operations of the company to certain jurisdictions may require structural and organizational modifications of the company s form of relationship with physician groups  which could have an adverse effect on the company 
there can be no assurance that the company s physician management agreements will not be challenged as constituting the unlicensed practice of medicine or that the enforceability of the provisions of such agreements  including non competition covenants  will not be limited 
under certain provisions of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of known as stark ii  physicians who refer medicare and medicaid patients to the company for certain designated services may not own stock in the company  and the company may not accept such referrals from physicians who own stock in the company 
stark ii contains an exemption which applies to the company during any year if at the end of the previous fiscal year the company had stockholders equity in the amount of at least million 
the company was not eligible for this exemption as of its fiscal year ending december  in  the company changed its fiscal year end to january  at which time it satisfied the stark ii stockholders equity exception 
violation of stark ii by the company could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company believes that its operations are conducted in material compliance with applicable laws  however  the company has not received a legal opinion to this effect and many aspects of the company s business operations have not been the subject of state or federal regulatory interpretation 
moreover  as a result of the company providing both physician practice management services and ancillary services  the company may be the subject of more stringent review by regulatory authorities  and there can be no assurance that a review of the company s operations by such authorities will not result in a determination that could have a material adverse effect on the company or its affiliated physicians 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the healthcare regulatory environment will not change so as to restrict the company s or the affiliated physicians existing operations or their expansion 
the regulatory framework of certain jurisdictions may limit the company s expansion into  or ability to continue operations within  such jurisdictions if the company is unable to modify its operational structure to conform to such regulatory framework or to obtain necessary approvals  licenses and permits 
any limitation on the company s ability to expand could have a material adverse effect on the company 
dependence on third party reimbursement  trends and cost containment 
substantially all of the company s patient service revenues are derived from third party payors 
the company s revenues and profitability may be materially adversely affected by the current trend within the healthcare industry toward cost containment as government and private third party payors seek to impose lower reimbursement and utilization rates and negotiate reduced payment schedules with service providers 
the company believes that this trend will continue to result in a reduction from historical levels of per patient revenue 
continuing budgetary constraints at both the federal and state level and the rapidly escalating costs of healthcare and reimbursement programs have led  and may continue to lead  to significant reductions in government and other third party reimbursements for certain medical charges and to the negotiation of reduced contract rates or capital or other financial risk shifting payment systems by third party payors with service providers 
both the federal government and various states are considering imposing limitations on the amount of funding available for various healthcare services 
the company cannot predict whether or when any such proposals will be adopted or  if adopted and implemented  what effect  if any  such proposals would have on the company 
further reductions in payments to physicians or other changes in reimbursement for healthcare services could have a material adverse effect on the company  unless the company is otherwise able to offset such payment reductions 
rates paid by private third party payors  including those that provide medicare supplemental insurance  are based on established physician  clinic and hospital charges and are generally higher than medicare payment rates 
changes in the mix of the company s patients among the non government payors and government sponsored healthcare programs  and among different types of non government payor sources  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company is a provider of certain medical treatment and diagnostic services including  but not limited to radiation therapy  infusion therapy  lithotripsy and home care 
because many of these services receive governmental reimbursement  they may be subject from time to time to changes in both the degree of regulation and level of reimbursement 
additionally  factors such as price competition and managed care also could reduce the company s revenues 
there can be no assurance that payments under governmental and private third party payor programs will not be reduced or will  in the future  be sufficient to cover costs allocable to patients eligible for reimbursement pursuant to such programs  or that any reductions in the company s revenues resulting from reduced payments will be offset by the company through cost reductions  increased volume  introduction of new procedures or otherwise 
risks associated with managed care contracts 
as an increasing percentage of patients come under the control of managed care entities  the company believes that its success will be  in part  dependent upon the company s ability to negotiate contracts with health maintenance organizations hmos  employer groups and other private third party payors pursuant to which services will be provided on a risk sharing or capitated basis 
under some of these agreements  a healthcare provider accepts a predetermined amount per member per month in exchange for providing all covered services to patients 
such contracts pass much of the economic risk of providing care from the payor to the provider 
the company s success in implementing its strategy of entering into such contracts in markets served by the company could result in greater predictability of revenues  but increased risk to the company resulting from uncertainty regarding expenses 
to the extent that patients or enrollees covered by such contracts require more frequent or extensive care than is anticipated  additional costs would be incurred  resulting in a reduction in operating margins 
in the worst case  revenues associated with risk sharing contracts or capitated provider networks would be insufficient to cover the costs of the services provided 
any such reduction or elimination of earnings could have a material adverse effect on the company 
moreover  there is no certainty that the company will be able to establish and maintain satisfactory relationships with third party payors  many of which already have existing provider structures in place and may not be able or willing to rearrange their provider networks 
increasingly  some jurisdictions are taking the position that capitated agreements in which the provider bears the risk should be regulated by insurance laws 
as a consequence  the company may be limited in some of the states in which it operates in its attempt to enter into or arrange capitated agreements for its affiliated physician practices  employee physicians or medical support service providers when those capitated arrangements involve the assumption of risk 
dependence on physicians and other medical service providers 
the company is dependent upon its affiliations with physicians and other ancillary service providers 
the company has entered into management and or employment agreements with most of its physicians and other medical service providers for terms ranging from seven to years 
a significant number of the company s affiliated physicians and other medical service providers have the right to terminate their contracts before the expiration of their respective terms 
in the event that a significant number of such physicians or providers terminate their contracts or become unable or unwilling to continue in their roles  the company s business could be materially adversely affected 
potential liability and insurance 
the provision of medical services entails an inherent risk of professional malpractice and other similar claims 
the company believes that it does not engage in the practice of medicine  however  the company could be implicated in such a claim through one of its providers  and there can be no assurance that claims  suits or complaints relating to services delivered by an affiliated physician or medical service provider will not be asserted against the company in the future 
although the company maintains insurance it believes is adequate both as to risks and amounts  there can be no assurance that any claim asserted against the company for professional or other liability will be covered by  or will not exceed the coverage limits of  such insurance 
potential loss of contracts 
although the company s clinical research study contracts with sponsors provide that it is entitled to receive fees earned through the date of termination  as well as all non cancelable costs  sponsors generally are free to terminate a clinical trial or the company s contract related thereto at any time 
the length of a typical clinical trial contract varies from several weeks to several years 
sponsors may terminate clinical trials for several reasons  including unexpected results or adverse patient reactions to a potential product  inadequate patient enrollment or investigator recruitment  manufacturing problems resulting in shortages of a potential product or decisions by the sponsor to de emphasize or terminate a particular trial or development efforts with respect to a particular potential product 
a sponsor s decision to terminate a trial in which the company participates could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
government regulation  potential impact of healthcare reform 
demand for the company s clinical research site management services is largely a function of the regulatory requirements associated with the approval of a new drug application imposed by the united states food and drug administration fda 
these requirements are more stringent and thus more burdensome than those imposed by many other developed countries 
in recent years  efforts have been made to streamline the drug approval process and coordinate united states standards with those of other developed countries 
changes in the level of regulation  including a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of simplified drug approval procedures could have a material adverse effect on the demand for the company s clinical trial services 
several competing proposals to reform the system of healthcare delivery in the united states have been considered by congress from time to time 
the process by which the government will pursue additional or modified proposals for national healthcare reform and the precise nature of any such proposals is unclear at this time 
some of the proposals put forth to date incorporate price controls on drugs and limits on overall medical spending which may adversely affect expenditures by the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries for research and development  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
at present  it is impossible to predict the effect of any new legislation or changes in regulatory environment on the company 
the failure of the company to comply with applicable regulations could result in the termination of on going research or the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities 
further  the issuance of a notice or finding by the fda to either the company or its clients based upon a material violation by the company of either good clinical practices or good laboratory practices could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
potential liability from operations 
clinical trials involve the testing of approved and experimental drugs on human beings 
this testing carries with it a significant risk of liability for personal injury or death to participants resulting from an adverse reaction to  or improper administration of  the potential product 
the company participates with sponsors in the selection process 
the company also contracts on behalf of its customers with physicians who render  and itself renders  professional services including administering the drugs being tested to participants in these trials 
consequently  the company may be subject to claims in the event of personal injury or death of persons participating in clinical trials and arising from professional malpractice of physicians with whom it has contracted and its own employees 
although the company is generally indemnified by its clients for such liability  in order for such indemnification to be valid  the company and its employees and agents must act within the bounds of specific procedural requirements governing the conduct of the clinical trial 
since the value of the company s indemnification depends on the financial viability of the indemnifying party  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to rely on such indemnification in each instance of potential liability 
if the company was forced to undertake the defense of  or found financial responsible for  claims based upon the foregoing or related risks  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
real estate services 
the company provides real estate services to related and unrelated third parties primarily for the establishment of various healthcare related facilities  including health parks  medical malls and medical office buildings 
in connection with these projects  the company enters into development contracts for the provision of all or some of the following services project finance assistance  project management  construction management  construction design engineering consultation  physician recruitment  consulting  due diligence services  leasing and marketing 
many of these contracts hold the company liable for any development cost overruns and also require the company to indemnify the owner of the medical facility and the owner of the land on which a medical facility is developed against certain liabilities or losses 
as a result  the company  which is not a contractor  enters into construction contracts with general contractors to construct its projects for a guaranteed maximum cost and requires the general contractors to maintain performance bonds and to indemnify the company against certain liabilities and losses 
any claim for development cost overruns not covered by a performance bond or any request for indemnification by the owner of the medical facility or the owner of the land on which a medical facility is developed  if the company is not indemnified by others  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
control by existing stockholders 
all of the company s executive officers and directors as a group beneficially own approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock 
as a result  such executive officers and directors  should they choose to act together  will be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval and to control the election of the company s board of directors 
this ownership may have the effect of discouraging unsolicited offers to acquire the company 
dependence upon key personnel 
the company is dependent upon the ability and experience of its executive officers  in particular abraham d 
gosman and bruce a 
rendina  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain all of such officers 
the failure of such officers to remain active in the company s management could have a material adverse effect on the company
