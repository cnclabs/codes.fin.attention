the year problem is pervasive and complex  extending beyond purely computational considerations  to control systems  as well 
virtually every computer  or computer chip driven operation will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to the issue is whether computer systems will properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
management plans to implement any necessary vendor upgrades and modifications to assure continued functionality with respect to the widely discussed software problems associated with the year at present  management does not expect that material incremental costs will be incurred in the aggregate or in any single future year

on february  aphton signed an agreement with pasteur merieux connaught pmc rhone poulenc group  a leader in medical science and research and the world s largest vaccine manufacturer and marketer  for a strategic alliance for all human cancer applications of the company s product gastrimmune tm including stomach  colorectal  liver and pancreatic cancers 
under the terms of the twenty year license and co promotion agreement  aphton will be responsible for product development  clinical trials and regulatory agency approvals  and pmc will be responsible for promotion  advertising  marketing  distribution and sales of gastrimmune tm in the united states  canada  europe including the cis countries and mexico 
in addition  aphton and pmc will enter into agreements providing for a the supply of gastrimmune tm from aphton to pmc  and b the supply of certain components of gastrimmune tm as well as other aphton products from pmc to aphton 
pmc will fund the costs associated with product introduction  promotion  advertising and marketing throughout the territory covered by the agreement 
under the terms of the agreement  in addition to upfront consideration aggregating million including million cash and the supply commitment of material suitable for human use of million  aphton will receive the majority of the profits from sales of gastrimmune tm with the balance of profits to be retained by pmc 
the supply commitment of materials suitable for human use consists of diphtheria toxoid and or tetanus toxoid 
aphton may use some or all of the unconditional supply commitment in the product under development with pmc or aphton may use some or all of the supply commitment on other current product lines or on research and development 
the supply commitment of material suitable for human use is not readily obtained on the open market in such large quantities 
by comparison to lower quality material available in smaller quantities management estimates that the market value of the supplies is substantially greater than the carrying value of million  if they could be obtained 
the carrying value of million is based on the negotiated license fee 
the amount of material to be received for the million is based on negotiated per unit costs  which are well below the per unit costs of lower quality materials available in smaller quantities 
the million upfront consideration has been classified as a license payment and has been deferred and will be recognized for financial statement accounting purposes as revenue within the twenty year period of the agreement 
the revenue recognition will begin once regulatory agency approval to market the product has been received and will be recognized ratably over the remaining period of the contract  which ends february  the company does not speculate on the timing of regulatory approvals 
however  they are not likely to occur in less than two years and quite possibly may occur in more than two years

further  under the agreement  none of the aggregate million consideration  either the cash or the company s rights to the full million in unconditional supply commitment  is refundable to pmc under any conditions 
there is no provision under the agreement for the unconditional supply commitment to be satisfied by pmc with a cash payment 
the million license payment was recognized for tax purposes in the year ended april  discussions are continuing between pmc and aphton for marketing rights to gastrimmune tm in japan and other asian markets
