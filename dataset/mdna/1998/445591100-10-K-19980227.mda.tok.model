such forward looking statements represent management s assessment based upon information currently available  but are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the company s ability to successfully complete the implementation  and realize the anticipated growth and other benefits  of its strategic plan on a timely basis  the effect of general economic conditions  technological and other changes affecting the manufacture of and demand for the company s products  competitive and other pressures in the market place  and other risks and uncertainties set forth herein and in the company s forms q and k filings with the securities and exchange commission 
results of operations in april  the company announced its adoption of a new strategy for growth and restructuring plan the strategic plan designed to restore higher levels of sales growth  profitability and to reduce its cost structure 
this plan resulted from a strategic assessment of the company s business conducted with the aid of outside consultants 
the cost reduction portion of the strategic plan resulted in cost savings of approximately million in fiscal and management believes will result in annual cost savings of approximately million commencing in fiscal 
the cost savings are expected to result primarily from a significant reduction of the company s stock keeping units skus  the rationalization of manufacturing and warehouse facilities and from a major restructuring of its administrative and marketing and selling functions  most of which actions were accomplished during fiscal over positions not including positions from the divestiture of businesses described below were eliminated in connection with the restructuring plan 
although the company expects realization of such future cost savings  there is no assurance that they will be achieved 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s operating results for fiscal include the effects of a pre tax special charge of million approximately million after taxes  or per share recorded in conjunction with the implementation of the strategic plan 
the charge to restructuring includes employee severance costs million  inventory writedowns and returns million  fixed and intangible asset writedowns million  recognition of future lease obligations million  and other related costs 
approximately of this special charge is for cash items  of which million remains accrued in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at november  the special charge to earnings for fiscal is included in the following categories in the accompanying consolidated statements of income in thousands  except per share data pre tax dollar after tax amount per share amount restructuring  cost of sales  
in late march  the company acquired all of the stock of sallmetall bv  a dutch company  for approximately million and the assumption of debt of approximately million 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
sallmetall s operations involve the design and assembly of laminating equipment and related adhesive film coating manufacturing 
management believes that the acquisition of this business will further strengthen the company s position as a leading global supplier of print finishing systems and expand its activity in the growing market for wide format short run digital imaging 
in connection with the company s strategic plan  during fiscal the company sold its lit ning products business desktop accessories and supplies  its hunt data products mediamate and calise brand products computer accessory products  and its speedball brand art products 
these divestitures resulted in an aggregate net pre tax gain of million approximately million after taxes  or 
per share 
the combined sales of these business units were approximately million  million and million in fiscal years through the various divestiture dates  and  respectively 
in addition  in mid november  the company sold its bevis office furniture business for million 
the company recorded an after tax gain of million  or per share  on this sale 
bevis had sales of approximately million in fiscal through the date of divestiture  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal this transaction completed the company s planned significant divestitures and represented the last major divestiture in the company s strategic plan 
the bevis business is presented as a discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and notes to consolidated financial statements 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion is on a continuing operations basis 
as a result of the above divestitures  including the discontinued business  an aggregate of approximately million of revenue on an annualized basis and related profit will not be available to the company going forward 
management believes a critical part of the strategic plan is to offset these revenue and earnings losses through increased focus on the company s graphics and substrates products in the high growth digital imaging  and sign and display markets  through leveraging of the company s brand strength in consumer products  from internal new product development and through acquisitions 
also  management believes improved manufacturing processes  rationalization of distribution facilities  and savings in administrative  marketing and selling support areas will help offset these losses
