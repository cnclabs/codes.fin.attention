excluded from the average rate column for interest income on loans is of interest income collected in on a cash basis which pertains to prior periods 
consolidated net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was million in  as compared to million in the million increase in net interest income during was due primarily to an increase in the volume of earning assets 
the bank s net interest margin for was  as compared to in the decrease in the net interest margin was primarily due to the impact of the competitive market and the resulting pressure on loan interest rates 
the bank s average prime was in  as compared to in in a declining rate environment  the company must generally increase its earning assets in order to maintain net interest income growth 
consolidated net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was million in  as compared to million in the million increase in net interest income during was due primarily to an increase in the volume of earning assets 
the bank s net interest margin for was  as compared to in the decrease in the net interest margin was primarily due to i the receipt of substantial interest income on a cash basis in approximately for loans that had been on nonaccrual status  ii the impact of the declining interest rate environment in  and iii the impact of the competitive market and the resulting pressure on loan interest rates 
the bank s average prime was in  as compared to in loan fees contributed of loan portfolio interest during  in and in this decline in the proportion of loan fees to total loan interest was due mainly to the increase in the competitive atmosphere relating to loan pricing  the overall level of interest rates and the higher proportion of sba loans included in the loan portfolio sba loans generally have lower origination fees 
interest expense in was million as compared to million in this was mainly due to the increase in volumes 
actual interest expense rates declined from in to in this compares to a decrease in the yields on earning assets of in to in 
proportionately interest expense declined at a greater rate than interest income in management s view because the bank took measures to assure the most efficient product pricing for deposit products 
interest expense in was million as compared to million in this was mainly due to the increase in volumes 
actual interest expense rates declined from in to in this compares to a decrease in the yields on earning assets of in to in a substantial portion of the bank s deposits an average of in  in and in are non interest bearing and therefore do not reprice when interest rates change 
see funding 
this is somewhat ameliorated by a significant amount of corporate account balances which are tied to earnings credits and utilized to offset bank service costs 
due to the nature of the company s lending markets in which loans are generally tied to the prime rate  an increase in interest rates should positively affect the company s future earnings  while a decline in interest rates would have a negative impact 
in late and early  market interest rates declined significantly due to several factors most notable of which were the strengthening of the dollar  the asia crisis and the collective wisdom that inflation has receded 
should this market trend of declining interest rates continue during  the bank could experience an additional increase in its cost of funds relative to the yields earned on its earning assets and a decrease in its net interest margin 
the company s net interest margin for the periods presented is high relative to its peer group  mainly due to its high proportion of non interest bearing deposits and the impact of the bank s financial services division 
net interest income also reflects the impact of nonperforming loans 
the effect of nonaccrual loans on interest income for the years ended december   and was as follows negative impact of nonaccrual loans dollars in thousands for the years ended december  interest revenue which would have been recorded under original terms interest revenue actually realized negative impact on interest revenue this table does not reflect the cash basis interest received on several significant loan collections during  as such loans were not classified as nonaccrual as of the end of the year 
the impact of such was significant in approximately of interest income was recognized in on collection of certain loans classified nonaccrual  which resulted in a basis point impact on the net interest margin 
provision for possible loan losses the level of the allowance for possible loan losses and therefore the related provision reflects the company s judgment as to the inherent risks associated with the loan and factoring portfolios 
since estimates of the adequacy of the company s allowance for possible loan losses are based on foreseeable risks  such judgments are subject to change based on changing circumstances 
based on management s current evaluation of such risks  as well as judgments of the company s regulators  additions of  and million were made to the allowance for possible loan losses in  and  respectively 
management s determinations of the provision in  and were based on the measurement of the possibility of future estimated loan losses through various objective and subjective criteria and the impact of net chargeoffs

it is estimated that for each change in interest rates  the value of the company s securities held to maturity will change by approximately 
any unrealized gain or loss on investment securities available for sale is reflected in the carrying value of the security and reported net of income taxes in the equity section of the condensed consolidated balance sheets

the net unrealized gain  net of tax  on securities available for sale as of december  was investment securities classified as held to maturity include those securities which the company has the ability and intent to hold to maturity 
the company s policy is to generally acquire a rated or better state and municipal securities 
the specific issues are monitored for changes in financial condition 
appropriate action would be taken if significant deterioration was noted 
the pre tax unrealized gain on investment securities held to maturity was as of december  as compared to as of december  the reduction in unrealized gains resulted from the significant decrease in interest rates in decreases in interest rates have an inverse effect on the value of securities for which the interest rate is fixed 
the bank s weighted average maturity of the held to maturity investment portfolio was approximately years as of december  it is estimated that for each change in interest rates  the value of the company s securities held to maturity will change by approximately 
this volatility decreases as the average maturity shortens 
since it is the intention of management to hold these securities to maturity  the unrealized gains will be realized over the life of the securities as above market interest income is recognized 
mortgage backed securities mbs are considered to have increased risks associated with them because of the timing of principal repayments 
as interest rates decrease  the average maturity of mortgages underlying mbs s tend to decline  as rates increase maturities tend to lengthen

total loan portfolio general the company s loan portfolio consists primarily of short term  floating rate loans for business and real estate purposes 
at december   approximately of the loan portfolio was commercial loans including non real estate sba loans and factoring  was real estate construction  and was in real estate other 
sjnb s legal lending limit for any one borrower was approximately million at december  the commercial loan portfolio primarily consists of loans to small to medium sized businesses with gross revenues up to million  as well as loans to local professional businesspersons 
sjnb s lending services include revolving credit loans  sba loans  term loans  accounts receivable financing  factoring  equipment financing and letters of credit 
included in commercial loans as of december  were factored accounts receivable of approximately million or of total loans 
as of december   factored accounts receivable were million or of total loans 
the bank purchases accounts receivable from clients and then receives payment directly from the party obligated for the receivable 
in most cases  the bank s financial services division purchases the receivables subject to recourse from the bank s factoring client 
the factoring business and related purchasing of accounts receivable is subject to a greater degree of risk than normal lending due to the involvement of the third party obligee  the lack of control over the direct receipt of payment  and the potential purchase of fraudulent or inflated receivables 
to date  there have been no significant losses relating to the bank s factoring program 
in addition commercial loans include approximately million of sba loans which are not made for real estate purposes 
these loans carry a to guarantee by the sba 
the real estate construction portfolio of the loan portfolio consists of residential and commercial 
such loans are made on the basis of the economic viability for the specific project  the cash flow resources of the developer  the developer s equity in the project and the underlying financial strength of the borrower 
the company s policy is to monitor each loan with respect to incurred costs  sales price and sales cycle 
the real estate other loans include term loans up to a twenty five year maturity on income producing commercial properties

concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of customers are engaged in similar business activities  or activities in the same geographic region  or have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions 
although the company has a diversified loan portfolio  a substantial portion of its customers ability to honor loan terms is reliant upon the economic stability of santa clara county  which in some degree relies on the stability of high technology companies in its silicon valley 
loans are generally made on the basis of a secure repayment source as the first priority and collateral is generally a secondary source for loan qualification 
approximately of the loan portfolio is directly related to real estate or real estate interests  when real estate construction loans  real estate other loans  prime equity loans included in consumer loans in the amount of million and certain other loans to real estate developers and other investors for short term investment purposes approximately of the loan portfolio are included 
included in the real estate other category are approximately million of sba real estate type loans  of which  to are guaranteed by the sba 
approximately of the loan portfolio is made up of commercial loans  however  no particular industry represents a significant portion of such loans 
inherent in any loan portfolio are risks associated with certain types of loans 
the company attempts to limit these risks through conservative loan policies and review procedures that are applied at the time of origination 
included in these policies are specific maximum loan to value ltv limitations as to various categories of real estate related loans 
these ratios are as follows maximum ltv category of real estate collateral ratio raw land land development construction single family residence  less than greater than other term loans construction take out and commercial other improved property prime equity loans the company s loan policy provides that any term loans on income producing properties must have a minimum debt service coverage of at least to for non owner occupied property and at least to for owner occupied 
one of the significant risks associated with real estate lending is the risk associated with the possible existence of environmental risks or hazards on or in property affiliated with the loan 
the bank mitigates such risk through the use of an environmental risk questionnaire for all loans secured by real estate 
a phase i environmental report is required if indicated by the questionnaire or if for any other reason it is determined appropriate 
other reasons would include the industrial use of environmentally sensitive substances or the proximity to other known environmental problems 
a phase ii report is required in certain cases  depending on the outcome of the phase i report 
activity total loans were million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
gross loans averaged million  million and million for the years ended  and  respectively 
the increase in total loans of million during relates to the overall growth in the bank s loan portfolio 
the most significant areas of growth were the increase in commercial loans of million 
in addition real estate construction increased million  while real estate other increased million  of which million was sba real estate loans 
during the most significant areas of growth were the increase in sba loans included in the commercial and real estate other loan categories of million and other commercial loans of million 
these increases were mainly due to the bank s business development efforts and the strength of the local economy 
the increase in loans for was primarily related to a million increase in sba loans 
the economic climate in northern california has been generally strong in and however  the competitive environment within the bank s marketplace for additional loan growth has become more aggressive between lenders resulting in increasingly competitive pricing 
to the extent that such competitive activity continues during and the bank finds it necessary to meet such competition  the bank s net interest margins could decline 
in addition  its uncertain what impact the economic crisis currently unfolding in asia will have on silicon valley and  potentially  the business of the bank 
asset quality allowance for possible loan losses a consequence of lending activities is that losses may be experienced 
the amount of such losses will vary from time to time depending upon the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio as affected by economic conditions  rising interest rates and the financial experience of borrowers 
the allowance for possible loan losses  which provides for the risk of losses inherent in the credit extension process  is increased by the provision for possible loan losses charged to expense and decreased by the amount of charge offs net of recoveries 
there is no precise method of predicting specific losses or amounts that ultimately may be charged off on particular segments of the loan portfolio 
similarly  the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan losses and the level of the related provision for possible loan losses is determined on a judgmental basis by management based on consideration of o economic conditions  o borrowers financial condition  o loan impairment  o evaluation of industry trends  o industry and other concentrations  o loans which are contractually current as to payment terms but demonstrate a higher degree of risk as identified by management  o continuing evaluation of the performing loan portfolio  o monthly review and evaluation of problem loans identified as having loss potential  o quarterly review by the board of directors  o off balance sheet risks  and o assessments by regulators and other third parties 
in addition to the internal assessment of the loan portfolio and off balance sheet credit risk  such as letters of credit  etc  the company also retains a consultant who performs credit reviews on a quarterly basis and then provides an assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan losses 
examinations of the loan portfolio are also conducted periodically by the federal banking regulators 
the company utilizes a method of assigning a minimum and maximum loss ratio for each grade of loan within each category of loans commercial  real estate other  real estate construction  etc 
loans are graded on a ranking system based on management s assessment of the loan s credit quality 
the assigned loss ratio is based upon the company s prior experience  industry experience  delinquency trends and the level of nonaccrual loans 
in addition  the company s methodology considers and assigns a risk factor for current economic conditions  off balance sheet risk and concentrations of credit 
the methodology provides a systematic approach for the measurement of the possible existence of future loan losses 
management and the board of directors evaluate the allowance and determine its desired level considering objective and subjective measures  such as knowledge of the borrowers business  valuation of collateral  the determination of impaired loans and exposure to potential losses 
based on known information available to it at the date of this report  management believes that the company s allowance for possible loan losses  determined as described above  was adequate for foreseeable losses at december  the allowance for possible loan losses is a general reserve available against the total loan portfolio and off balance sheet credit exposure 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for possible loan losses 
such agencies may require the bank to provide additions to the allowance based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination 
there is uncertainty concerning future economic trends 
accordingly  it is not possible to predict the effect future economic trends may have on the level of the provision for possible loan losses in future periods 
the following table summarizes the activity in the allowance for possible loan losses for the five years ended december  allowance for possible loan losses dollars in thousands years ended december  balance  beginning of the year      chargeoffs by loan category commercial real estate construction real estate other consumer other total chargeoffs  recoveries by loan category commercial real estate construction real estate other consumer other total recoveries net chargeoffs  provision charged to expense  allowance relating to acquired businesses  balance  end of the year      ratios net chargeoffs to average loans allowance to total loans at the end of the year allowance to nonperforming loans at end of the year  net chargeoffs were or of average loans during net chargeoffs were or of average loans during during  the company experienced net chargeoffs of or of average loans during the decrease in net chargeoffs in as compared to resulted primarily from improved credit quality of the overall loan portfolio

nonperforming loans were  and at december     respectively

based on an evaluation of individual credits  historical credit loss experienced by loan type and economic conditions  management has allocated the allowance for possible loan losses as follows for the past five years allocation of the allowance for possible loan losses dollars in thousands amount of allowance allocation at december  commercial     real estate construction real estate other     consumer other unallocated total      percent of loans in each category to total loans at december  commercial real estate construction real estate other consumer other total the allowance for possible loan losses is maintained without any internal allocation to the segments of the loan portfolio and the entire allowance is available to cover loan losses 
the allocation is based on subjective estimates that take into account historical loss experience and management s current assessment of the relative risk characteristics of the portfolio as of the reporting date noted above and as described more fully herein 
nonperforming loans loans for which the accrual of interest has been suspended and other loans with principal or interest contractually past due days or more are set forth in the following table nonperforming loans dollars in thousands december  loans accounted for on a non accrual basis   loans restructured and in compliance with modified terms other loans with principal or interest contractually past due days or more total   potential nonperforming loans are identified by management as part of its ongoing evaluation and review of the loan portfolio 
based on such reviews and information known to management at the date of this report  management has not identified any loans other than those in the above table about which it has serious doubts regarding the borrowers ability to comply with present loan repayment terms  such that the loans might subsequently be classified as nonperforming 
the accrual of interest on loans is discontinued and any accrued and unpaid interest is reversed when  in the opinion of management  there is significant doubt as to the collectibility of interest or principal or when the payment of principal or interest is ninety days past due  unless the amount is well secured and in the process of collection 
other real estate owned at december   the bank had two properties totaling there was none at december  which were acquired through the foreclosure process 
prior to recording a foreclosure  the bank provides for any expected loss in its allowance for possible loan losses 
any subsequent decline in value is charged directly to the income statement 
commitments and lines of credit it is the bank s policy not to issue formal commitments or lines of credit except to a limited number of well established and financially responsible local commercial enterprises 
such commitments can be either secured or unsecured and are typically in the form of revolving lines of credit for seasonal working capital needs 
occasionally  such commitments are in the form of a letter of credit to facilitate the customer s particular business transaction 
commitments and lines of credit typically mature within one year 
these commitments involve to varying degrees credit risk in excess of the amount recognized as either an asset or liability in the statement of financial position 
the company attempts to control credit risk through its credit approval process 
the same credit policies are used when entering into such commitments 
as of december   the company had undisbursed loan commitments to extend credit as follows undisbursed loan commitments dollars in thousands loan category amount commercial  real estate construction  real estate other consumer  other  total  in addition  there was approximately million available for commitments under unused letters of credit 
funding deposits represent sjnb s principal source of funds 
most of the bank s deposits are obtained from professionals  small to medium sized businesses and individuals within the bank s market area 
sjnb s deposit base consists of non interest and interest bearing demand deposits  savings and money market accounts  and certificates of deposit 
the following table summarizes the composition of deposits as of december   and deposit categories dollars in thousands december  december  december  percentage percentage percentage total of total total of total total of total amount deposits amount deposits amount deposits noninterest bearing demand    interest bearing demand    money market and savings    certificates of deposit less than    or more    total    deposits increased from million at december  to million at december  deposits increased from million at december  to million at december  these increases are mainly due to a combination of factors including the development of customers with significant cash balances  utilization of sophisticated cash management systems and aggressive pricing of rates 
the bank has been able to attract a significant proportion of its deposits in the form of non interest bearing deposits 
the bank s primary business is commercially oriented and therefore significant non interest bearing deposits are maintained by its commercial customers 
in a high interest rate environment  these funds could be subject to disintermediation moved for higher interest rate products 
to counter such possibilities  the bank maintains an array of products which it believes would be competitive in such an occurrence 
in addition  in illiquid economic times possibly recessions these deposits could be subject to withdrawal pressures 
see capital and liquidity liquidity for a discussion of the bank s liquidity sources 
the bank also raises a substantial amount of funds through certificates of deposit of or greater 
these deposits are usually at interest rates greater than other types of deposits and are more sensitive to interest rate changes 
historically  the bank s overall cost of funds has been less than that of its peer group 
however  as these certificates of deposit are usually more interest rate sensitive  their repricing in an increasing interest rate environment could increase the bank s cost of funds and negatively impact the bank s net interest margin 
see capital and liquidity 
the bank utilizes short term borrowings in its balance sheet management 
the short term borrowings securities sold under agreements to repurchase are used to fund the acquisition of fixed rate available for sale securities with an average life of years at december  the average cost of the borrowings during was while the average yield on the assets was 
if interest rates were to increase quickly  the cost of borrowings would increase with no offsetting increase in the yield on the assets purchased 
see asset liability management 
asset liability management the company defines interest rate sensitivity as the measurement of the mismatch in repricing characteristics of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments at a specified point in time 
this mismatch known as interest rate sensitivity gap represents the potential mismatch in the change in the rate of interest revenue accrual and interest expense that would result from a change in interest rates 
mismatches in interest rate repricing among assets and liabilities arise primarily from the interaction of various customer businesses ie  types of loans versus the types of deposits maintained and from management s discretionary investment and funds gathering activities 
the company attempts to manage its exposure to interest rate sensitivity 
however  due to its size and direct competition from the major banks  the company must offer products which are competitive in the market place  even if less than optimum with respect to its interest rate exposure 
the company s balance sheet position at december  was asset sensitive  based upon the significant amount of variable rate loans and the repricing characteristics of its deposit accounts 
this position provides a hedge against rising interest rates  but has a detrimental effect during times of interest rate decreases 
net interest revenues are negatively impacted by a decline in interest rates 
the interest rate gap is a measure of interest rate exposure and is based upon the known repricing dates of certain assets and liabilities and assumed repricing dates of others 
see financial review net interest income and margin 
the following table quantifies the company s interest rate exposure at december  based upon the known repricing dates of certain assets and liabilities and the assumed repricing dates of others

for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to reprice  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
additionally  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
further  certain earning assets have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
the company considers the anticipated effects of these various factors in implementing its interest rate risk management activities  including the utilization of certain interest rate hedges 
a large proportion of the bank s deposits are non interest bearing demand deposits and are not included in the above table as they tend not to be interest rate sensitive 
the average balance of these deposits was million in in addition  the bank s total tangible capital of approximately million is not included as a funding source in the above table 
to counter its asset sensitive interest rate position  the bank entered into an interest rate floor in the amount of million which expires in may the bank paid a fixed premium of for which it will receive the amount of interest on million based on the difference of and prime when prime is less than 
this provides some protection to the bank against decreases in its net income when the prime rate decreases 
settlement is done quarterly and the bank records the impact of this hedge on an accrual basis 
the bank has executed several transactions during and which are intended to mitigate its exposure to a decline in general market interest rates 
the transactions involved the purchase of three us government agency and three mortgage backed securities for an aggregate cost of million which were financed through the use of day repurchase agreements 
the repurchase agreements are shown as short term borrowings on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the securities are fixed rate with maturities of million in may  million in july  million in october  million in september  million in march and million in november the average yield on the securities was 
the outstanding repurchase agreements as of december  had interest rates within a range of to and averaged and mature within days 
as these repurchase agreements expire they will be renewed at the prevailing rates 
these transactions carry risks in a rising rate environment because of the potential repricing volatility associated with the short term repurchase market 
if interest rates were to increase  the cost of borrowings would increase with no offsetting increase in the yield on the assets purchased 
at the same time it is anticipated that the average yield on variable rate loans would increase and offset this impact

see notes to consolidated financial statements and business supervision and regulation for a discussion of the company s capital requirements 
liquidity management strives to maintain a level of liquidity sufficient to meet customer requirements for loan funding and deposit withdrawals 
liquidity requirements are evaluated by taking into consideration factors such as deposit concentrations  seasonality and maturities  loan demand  capital expenditures  and prevailing and anticipated economic conditions 
sjnb s business is generated primarily through customer referrals and employee business development efforts 
the bank utilizes brokered deposits on a limited basis to satisfy temporary liquidity needs 
the bank s sources of liquidity consist of its deposits with other banks  overnight funds sold to correspondent banks and short term  marketable investments net of short term borrowings 
on december   consolidated liquid assets totaled million or of consolidated total assets  as compared to million or of consolidated total assets on december  in addition to the liquid asset portfolio  sjnb also has available million in informal lines of credit with three major commercial banks  approximately million of credit available at the federal reserve discount window and million in sba guaranteed loans which are available for sale and could be sold within a day period 
sjnb is primarily a business and professional bank and  as such  its deposit base is more susceptible to economic fluctuations 
accordingly  management strives to maintain a balanced position of liquid assets to volatile and cyclical deposits 
in their normal course of business  commercial clients maintain balances in large certificates of deposit 
the stability of these balances hinges upon  among other factors  market conditions and each business seasonality 
large certificates of deposit amounted to of total deposits on december   as compared to for liquidity is also affected by investment securities and loan maturities and the effect of interest rate fluctuations on the marketability of both assets and liabilities 
the loan portfolio consists primarily of floating rate  short term loans 
on december   approximately of total consolidated assets had maturities under one year and of total consolidated loans had floating rates tied to the prime rate or similar indexes 
the short term nature of the loan portfolio  and loan agreements which generally require monthly interest payments  provide the company with an additional secondary source of liquidity 
there are no material commitments for capital expenditures in or beyond 
the company s liquidity is maintained by cash flows stemming from dividends and management fees from the bank and the exercise of stock options issued to the bank s employees and directors 
the amount of dividends from the bank is subject to certain regulatory restrictions as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere within this report 
subject to said restrictions  at december   up to million could have been paid to the parent company by the bank without regulatory approval 
the company s financial statements are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
dividends of million were paid to the parent company during  while no dividends were paid to the company by the bank in or effects of inflation the most direct effect of inflation on the company is higher interest rates 
because a significant portion of the bank s deposits are represented by non interest bearing demand accounts  changes in interest rates have a direct impact on the financial results of the bank 
see asset liability management 
another effect of inflation is the upward pressure on the company s operating expenses 
inflation did not have a material effect on the bank s operations in  or item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company defines interest rate sensitivity as the measurement of the mismatch in repricing characteristics of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments at a specified point in time 
this mismatch known as interest rate sensitivity gap represents the potential mismatch in the change in the rate of interest income and interest expense that would result from a change in interest rates 
mismatches in interest rate repricing among assets and liabilities arise primarily from the interaction of various customer businesses ie  types of loans versus the types of deposits maintained and from management s discretionary investment and funds gathering activities 
the company attempts to manage its exposure to interest rate sensitivity 
however  due to its size and direct competition from the major banks  the company must offer products which are competitive in the market place  even if less than optimum with respect to its interest rate exposure 
the company s balance sheet position at december  was asset sensitive  based upon the significant amount of variable rate loans and the repricing characteristics of its deposit accounts 
this position provides a hedge against rising interest rates  but has a detrimental effect during times of interest rate decreases 
net interest revenues are negatively impacted by a decline in interest rates 
the interest rate gap is a measure of interest rate exposure and is based upon the known repricing dates of certain assets and liabilities and assumed repricing dates of others
