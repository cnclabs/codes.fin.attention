see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the above business combinations 
supplemental operating information for us robotics following is supplemental information regarding us robotics results of operations for the three month period ended may  in thousands 
results for these periods exclude reclassifications made to conform to the company s financial statement presentation 
three march april may months ended may  sales    gross margin    total operating expenses    operating income loss    income loss before income taxes    income tax provision benefit    net income loss    us robotics sales for the month ended march  march were approximately million  reflecting strong market demand worldwide for information access devices including the introduction and initial high volume shipments of products incorporating xtm technology x products 
x technology increases the potential speed for downloading data from or kilobits per second kbps for standard v 
modems to kbps 
consistent with us robotics non linear quarterly sales pattern  sales in the first two months of the quarter were relatively low and in the third month of the quarter  which march represents  were significantly higher 
gross margin for march was approximately million  or percent of sales 
the overall gross margin reflected the initial high volume shipments of x products  which generated higher gross margins due to u 
s 
robotics temporary first to market advantage over competitors in the kbps modem market 
also  to a lesser extent  the overall gross margin reflected higher margins on the initial sales of newer generation handheld connected organizer products introduced during the month 
total operating expenses for march were approximately million  or percent of sales 
sales and marketing expenses reflected significant spending related to the introduction of x products  other marketing programs designed to generate continuing growth in sales and efforts to expand market share  and continuing investments to increase the worldwide sales force with the intent of increasing sales of network systems products 
general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses reflected continuing investments in personnel and systems necessary to support us robotics expanded level of business activity and its commitment to new product and technology development 
as a percentage of sales  total operating expenses for march were low due to the non linear sales pattern described above 
gross sales for the two months ended may  were approximately million 
net sales after provisions  primarily for product returns of million and price protection of million  were approximately million 
these results principally reflect the following factors us robotics non linear sales pattern  as described above  lower than anticipated sales out of the channel  due in part to confusion about the new kbps technologies and concerns regarding the absence of an industry standard for kbps modems  efforts to reduce levels of channel inventory  including increased emphasis on sales out of the channel via price reductions and other promotions  and product returns from channel partners whose sales out had been lower than anticipated 
returns during the two months ended may  totaled million  reflecting primarily desktop modems and remote access concentrators 
the majority of the desktop modem returns consisted of older generation products  which were heavily impacted by the march introduction of us robotics kbps modem with x technology 
returns of remote access concentrators were due primarily to lower than anticipated sales out of the distribution channel 
based on negotiations with individual customers  us robotics allowed returns during this period in excess of customers contractual rights due to the kbps technology transition and the desire to reduce channel inventory 
returns during this period exceeded the march  balance in the allowance for sales returns of million by million 
the price protection provision of million related primarily to price reductions effective subsequent to march  for desktop modems and remote access concentrator product lines 
gross margin for this period was affected adversely by the provision for price protection described above  a provision for potentially excess and obsolete inventory of approximately million  and unabsorbed manufacturing costs 
operating expenses for the two months ended may  were approximately million 
sales and marketing expenses reflected significant spending related to the introduction of x products and newer generation handheld connected organizer products  other marketing programs designed to generate continuing growth in sales and expand market share  and continuing investments to increase the worldwide sales force with the intent of increasing sales of network systems products 
general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses reflected continuing investments in personnel and systems necessary to support us robotics anticipated growth and its commitment to new product and technology development 
as a percentage of sales  total operating expenses for the two months ended may  were high due to the non linear sales pattern described above 
other expenses  net  for the two months ended may  were approximately million 
such expenses reflected higher interest expense due to increased short term borrowing 
during these two months  us robotics increased its short term borrowings from approximately million to approximately million  comprised of million under an existing million short term borrowing arrangement and million under an existing million revolving credit facility 
such borrowings were primarily necessary to fund ongoing operating expenses  including costs associated with the launch of the new x technology  as well as capital expenditures 
the company repaid such short term borrowing shortly after the closing of the merger in june between com and us robotics  and the use of these borrowing arrangements is no longer expected to be required 
the provision for income taxes for the two months ended may  was a net benefit of approximately million  resulting in an effective tax rate of percent 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentage of total sales represented by the line items reflected in the company s consolidated statements of income years ended may  sales cost of sales gross margin operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative non recurring charges purchased in process technology merger related charges and other total operating expenses operating income other income  net income before income taxes income tax provision net income excluding non recurring charges total operating expenses operating income net income comparison of fiscal years ended may  and sales fiscal sales totaled billion  a decline of three percent from fiscal sales of billion 
sales of client access products eg  network interface cards nics and modems in fiscal were billion  a decrease of eight percent from fiscal sales of billion 
sales of client access products represented percent of total sales in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal sales of network systems products eg  switches  routers  hubs  and remote access products in fiscal were billion  an increase of three percent compared to fiscal sales of billion 
sales of network systems products represented percent of total sales in fiscal  compared to percent a year ago 
sales in the us represented percent of total sales for fiscal and fiscal the company experienced a decline from fiscal in domestic and international sales of four and two percent  respectively 
fiscal sales were affected by the following factors industry growth rates 
networking industry growth rates have slowed since the beginning of calendar while the industry had grown at rates in excess of percent in prior years  recent reports indicate that the networking industry worldwide grew by less than percent during  and this pattern has continued into channel inventory 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company adopted a new inventory business model  which generally calls for fewer weeks supply of inventory in the distribution channel 
the company transitioned to this model during the second and third quarters of fiscal as a result  sales during these periods were adversely affected 
modems 
fiscal sales of modem products decreased compared to fiscal in january  the international telecommunications union itu finally determined the v 
standard for kbps technology 
the company believes that the previous lack of such a standard contributed to delays in customers purchasing decisions for higher speed modems and remote access concentrators 
although the company began shipping v 
standard modems late in the third quarter of fiscal  the company believes these delays  as well as product transitions  adversely affected sales 
in addition  the delay in the v 
standard caused aggressive pricing in older generation modem products  which in connection with the channel inventory reduction mentioned above  contributed to a year over year decrease in sales 
pricing 
the pricing environment has been very competitive  and although the company experienced significant year over year unit growth in key products such as fast ethernet nics and workgroup switches  these gains were partially offset by declines in average selling prices 
for example  in fiscal  the company experienced price decreases between and percent compared to fiscal in a number of product segments  including modems  workgroup switches  hubs and remote access concentrators 
while the trend of declining average selling prices is expected to continue in future periods  the company believes that price erosion will be less than that experienced in fiscal remote access concentrators 
fiscal sales of remote access concentrators decreased compared to fiscal factors affecting this decrease included aggressive price competition  including the introduction of new higher density products at prices similar to the older lower density products 
in addition  sales of remote access concentrators were impacted by the channel inventory reduction described above 
asia pacific economic turmoil 
during fiscal  sales in the asia pacific region increased only four percent compared to fiscal sales growth was percent in fiscal compared to fiscal historically  the asia pacific region had been a high growth region for the networking industry and the company 
during fiscal  however  several asian countries experienced a weakening of their local currencies and turmoil in their financial markets and institutions  which the company believes adversely affected financial results during fiscal handheld connected organizer and switching products 
fiscal sales of handheld connected organizer products more than doubled compared to fiscal and achieved growth in market share  according to recent industry reports 
growth rates and market share gains in the handheld connected organizer market may not be sustainable in the face of increasing competition from new entrants to the market 
in addition  the company s workgroup switching products experienced significant unit volume growth and increased sales  despite significant declines in average selling prices and the effect of the channel inventory reduction  as described in the above paragraphs 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of sales was percent in fiscal  compared to percent in fiscal in addition to the factors mentioned above  the company s year over year gross margin decline was affected by several factors  including product mix  increased price competition  and higher period costs 
the company s product mix included higher sales of certain nics and workgroup switching products  as well as an increase in sales to original equipment manufacturers oems  which carry lower gross margins 
the us robotics brand modems with x technology were introduced in the third quarter of fiscal with significantly higher margins  reflecting first to market pricing 
during the past twelve months  increased product and price competition in this product segment resulted in a decline in gross margin percent 
additionally  the company experienced aggressive pricing of remote access products  as described above  which resulted in a decline in gross margin percent 
fixed manufacturing costs and period costs were a higher percentage of sales  primarily as a result of the decrease in sales in the second and third quarters of fiscal  but also due to excess manufacturing capacity 
the company is continuing to consolidate manufacturing and distribution sites in fiscal operating expenses operating expenses in fiscal were billion  or percent of sales  compared to billion  or percent of sales in fiscal operating expenses as a percentage of sales were higher than historical levels  in part due to the reduced level of sales for fiscal  as discussed above 
excluding a purchased in process technology charge of million and merger related and other charges of million primarily associated with the us robotics merger  operating expenses would have been billion  or percent of sales for fiscal excluding a purchased in process technology charge of million associated with the acquisition of scorpio and a merger related charge of million associated with the acquisition of onstream  operating expenses would have been billion  or percent of sales for fiscal sales and marketing expenses in fiscal increased million or percent from fiscal sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales increased to percent of sales in fiscal from percent in fiscal the year over year increase is attributable to the expansion of field sales and marketing activities worldwide  primarily internationally  and increased spending for the company s customer service programs 
in addition  spending on the company s global branding campaign during fiscal contributed to increased marketing expenses from the prior year 
research and development expenses in fiscal increased million or percent compared to fiscal research and development expenses as a percentage of sales increased to percent of sales compared to percent of sales in fiscal the year over year increase in research and development expenses in absolute dollars and dollars as a percentage of sales was primarily attributable to the cost of developing the company s new products in the areas of client access and switching  and its expansion into new technologies and markets  such as xdsl 
for example  during fiscal  the company developed a fully integrated single chip fast ethernet nic  the corebuildertm layer switch  the palm iiitm handheld connected organizer  as well as many other key new products 
the company believes the timely introduction of new technologies and products is crucial to its success and plans to continue to make acquisitions or strategic investments to accelerate time to market where appropriate 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased million or seven percent from fiscal as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses increased to percent  compared to percent in fiscal the year over year increase in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars and dollars as a percentage of sales primarily reflected the expansion of the company s infrastructure  including personnel  as well as an increased provision for bad debts 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a charge of approximately million for purchased in process technology associated with the lanworks acquisition 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  the company recorded merger related and other charges of million 
these charges consisted of a merger related charge and other charges associated with past merger activities and disposition of real estate 
the merger related charge of approximately million related to the merger with us robotics 
during the fourth quarter  the company reversed approximately million of previously recorded merger accruals 
the company also sold a parcel of land near its headquarters site in santa clara  which resulted in a net gain of approximately million 
also during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company made a decision to close a manufacturing site in illinois in order to consolidate two chicago area manufacturing facilities into one location 
the company recognized a charge of approximately million associated with this closure 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
other income  net other income  net increased million compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of higher interest income due to higher average cash balances 
other income  net for fiscal included a charge of approximately million related to an early call premium and write off of unamortized issuance fees associated with the redemption of million of convertible notes in december the majority of the company s sales are denominated in us dollars 
where available  the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain balance sheet exposures and intercompany balances against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
fiscal other income  net includes foreign currency losses of approximately million  primarily related to korean operations  where foreign exchange hedges were not available  or were available only to a limited extent 
taxes the company s effective income tax rate was approximately percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal excluding the non deductible portion of merger related and other charges primarily associated with the merger with us robotics  the pro forma income tax rate was percent for fiscal excluding a charge for purchased in process technology of approximately million and tax benefit of approximately million associated with the acquisition of scorpio and the non deductible portion of the merger related charge associated with the merger with onstream  the pro forma income tax rate was percent for fiscal net income net income for fiscal was million  or per share  compared to net income of million  or per share for fiscal excluding a charge for purchased in process technology and merger related and other charges mentioned above  net income would have been million  or per share for fiscal excluding the purchased in process technology and tax benefit  and the merger related charge  net income would have been million  or per share for fiscal comparison of fiscal years ended may  and sales fiscal sales totaled billion  an increase of percent from fiscal sales of billion 
sales of client access products in fiscal were billion  an increase of percent from fiscal sales of billion 
sales of client access products in fiscal represented percent of total sales compared to percent in fiscal sales of network systems products in fiscal were billion  an increase of percent compared to fiscal sales of billion 
sales of network systems products represented percent of total sales in fiscal  compared to percent in fiscal fiscal sales growth was particularly strong in the areas of fast ethernet nics  stackable hubs and switches  modems  remote access concentrators  atm high function switches and handheld connected organizers 
sales in the us represented percent of total sales for fiscal compared to percent for fiscal us and international sales increased and percent  respectively  compared to fiscal the increase in international sales was a result of strong growth in the european and asia pacific regions due to the company s continued global expansion through the opening of new sales offices in asia  latin america and europe and the expansion of worldwide service and support programs 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of sales was percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal the us robotics brand modems with x technology were introduced in the third quarter of fiscal  with significantly higher margins  reflecting first to market pricing 
the company s year over year gross margin increase primarily reflected an improved product mix  specifically higher sales of certain modems  workgroup switching and hub products and lower sales of network access concentrators and lower product material costs of certain nics 
the increase in gross margins was partially offset by a higher sales mix of certain lower margin nics and increased pricing pressures on remote access products 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company reduced its average selling prices on fast ethernet nics by approximately percent in response to increased competition  thus causing a decline in gross margins  which was not completely reflected in fiscal operating expenses operating expenses in fiscal were billion  or percent of sales  compared to billion  or percent of sales in fiscal excluding a purchased in process technology charge of million associated with the scorpio acquisition and a merger related charge of million associated with the onstream acquisition  operating expenses would have been billion  or percent of sales for fiscal excluding a purchased in process technology charge of million associated with the acquisitions of scorpio and axon and merger related and other charges of million primarily associated with the acquisition of chipcom  operating expenses would have been billion  or percent of sales for fiscal sales and marketing expenses in fiscal increased million or percent from fiscal sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales increased to percent of sales in fiscal from percent in fiscal the year over year increase is attributable to the expansion of field sales and marketing activities and personnel worldwide  as well as an increase in spending for the company s customer service programs 
in addition  the company increased spending on advertising and marketing incentive programs and promotions associated with the introduction of the x products 
research and development expenses in fiscal increased million or percent compared to fiscal research and development expenses as a percentage of sales increased to percent of sales compared to percent of sales in fiscal the year over year increase in research and development expenses in absolute dollars and dollars as a percentage of sales was primarily attributable to the cost of developing new products in the areas of client access  switching  and network management and its expansion into new technologies and markets 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased million or percent from fiscal as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses increased to percent  compared to percent in fiscal the year over year increase in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars and dollars as a percentage of sales primarily reflected the expansion of the company s infrastructure  including facilities  personnel  and an increased provision for bad debts 
other income  net other income  net was percent of sales in both fiscal and fiscal other income  net for fiscal reflected increased interest income due to higher cash and investment balances  which was offset by increased interest and other expense due to higher levels of short term debt 
the majority of the company s sales are denominated in us dollars 
where available  the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain balance sheet exposures and intercompany balances against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
the impact of foreign exchange was not significant for fiscal or taxes the company s effective income tax rate was approximately percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal excluding a charge for purchased in process technology of approximately million and tax benefit of approximately million associated with the acquisition of scorpio and the non deductible portion of the merger related charge associated with the merger with onstream  the pro forma income tax rate was percent for fiscal excluding the non deductible purchased in process technology charge of approximately million associated with the acquisitions of scorpio and axon  and merger related and other charges  primarily associated with chipcom  the pro forma income tax rate was percent for fiscal net income net income for fiscal was million  or per share  compared to net income of million  or per share for fiscal excluding the purchased in process technology and related tax benefit and the merger related charge  net income was million  or per share for fiscal excluding the purchased in process technology and merger related and other charges mentioned above  net income was million  or per share for fiscal business environment and risk factors financial model 
in managing its business  the company annually establishes a long term financial model based on observed and anticipated trends in technology and the marketplace 
the model  which includes ranges for gross margin  operating expenses and operating income  is not intended to be a prediction of future financial results  rather  it is used to assist the company s management in making decisions about the allocation of resources and investments 
the current model is as follows gross margin operating expenses operating income the gross margin and operating expenses ranges of the model were reduced during fiscal to reflect  in part  increasing sales attributable to pc oems  the emerging importance of the consumer and small enterprise market segment and increased price competition 
the company is not currently operating within the ranges of the model and does not expect that its financial results will be within these ranges in the short term 
while the company expects to make progress toward these ranges in fiscal  there can be no assurance that the company will do so or that actual results in any particular period will fall within the ranges stated in the long term model above 
competition and pricing 
the company participates in a highly volatile industry characterized by vigorous competition for market share  rapid product and technology development  uncertainty over adoption of industry standards and declining prices 
the company s competition comes from start up companies  well capitalized computer systems and communications companies  and other technology companies 
many of the company s current and potential competitors have greater financial  marketing and technical resources than the company 
the effects of intense competition in the company s industry include aggressive pricing practices and declining product prices  which have directly impacted the company s operating results 
for example  the company s results in fiscal were negatively impacted by decreasing prices in the modem market resulting in part from increased competition for market share  particularly in the oem channel  and the availability of low priced components 
in addition  the introduction of the new v 
kbps technology placed significant downward price pressure on older products 
significant competition and decreasing prices have also impacted other product lines  including switches  hubs and remote access concentrators 
there can be no assurance that intense competition in the industry and particular actions of the company s competitors will not have an adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in particular  the company expects that prices on many of its products will continue to decrease in the future and that such price decreases may have an adverse impact on the results of operations or financial condition of the company 
development and introduction of new products 
the company is actively engaged in the research and development of new technologies and products 
the company s success depends  in substantial part  on the identification of new market and product opportunities and the development and market acceptance of new products  such as the recently introduced corebuilder layer switches 
the company s business  operating results  or financial condition may be adversely affected by a change in one or more of the technologies affecting network communications  a change in market demand for products based on a particular technology  a failure to develop new products  delays in shipping new products  or technical problems with new products 
with the highly competitive nature of the company s industry  new products are routinely introduced by competitors 
for example  microsoft corporation and its licensees recently entered the handheld connected organizer market to compete with the palm computing r platform  the company s fastest growing product category 
the company s business may be adversely impacted by the development by competitors of products and technologies that render the company s products obsolete or noncompetitive 
the company s success also depends  in part  on the adoption of industry standards  the timely introduction of new standards compliant products  and market acceptance of these products 
for example  the v 
kbps standard was established in january  and the company introduced v 
products in february the company s results have been and will continue to be affected by the extent to which the v 
technology is deployed by internet service providers and adopted by internet and other modem users 
slow market acceptance of new technologies and industry standards  such as the v 
technology  can and will have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
industry consolidation and integration of acquired companies 
the networking industry is in a period of significant consolidation 
for example  during fiscal  the company merged with us robotics  cisco systems acquired nine companies  bay networks acquired four companies  lucent technologies acquired four companies  and northern telecom announced that it would acquire bay networks 
the company expects that networking industry consolidation will continue  including combinations between traditional suppliers of telecommunications or voice networking and data networking companies 
future business combinations may result in companies with strong competitive positions and products 
continued consolidation may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
during fiscal  the company completed the merger with us robotics 
achieving the benefits of an acquisition depend  in part  upon whether the integration of the acquired business  products or technology is accomplished in an efficient and effective manner 
there can be no assurance with the company s recent acquisitions or any future acquisitions that the products  technologies  distribution channels  customer support operations  management information systems  research and development efforts and key personnel of the acquired companies will be effectively assimilated into the company s business or product offerings 
the failure to effectively integrate acquired companies and their products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  or financial condition 
declining industry growth rates 
the company s success is dependent  in part  on the overall growth rate of the networking industry 
in and early  industry growth was well below historical rates 
there can be no assurance that the networking industry will continue to grow or that it will again achieve higher growth rates 
the company s business  operating results or financial condition may be adversely affected by any further decrease in industry growth 
in addition  there can also be no assurance that the company s results in any particular period will fall within the ranges for growth forecast by market researchers 
reliance on distributors  resellers and oems 
the company sells a significant portion of its products to distributors  resellers and oems 
in recent years  the percentage of products sold through these channels has increased 
the company s reliance on distributors  resellers and oems subjects the company to many risks  including inventory  credit and business concentration 
the company s distributors and resellers maintain significant levels of the company s products in their inventories 
the company attempts to ensure that appropriate levels of products are available to end users by working closely with distributors and resellers to manage inventory levels 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company adopted a new inventory business model  which generally calls for fewer weeks supply of inventory in the channel and the company accepting some inventory risk previously held by its customers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in efforts to manage the inventory levels of its distributors and resellers or that the company will be able to successfully operate its business within its inventory business model 
any failure by the company to do so could adversely affect the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
in addition  the company s results could be negatively impacted if the company s distributors and resellers implement a different channel inventory model 
the distribution and reseller channels utilized by the company have undergone a significant level of consolidation 
as a result  the company has an increased concentration of credit risk 
while the company monitors and attempts to manage this risk  financial difficulties on the part of one or more of the company s distributors or resellers may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the company derives an increasing portion of its sales from oems  including pc companies that bundle com nics and modems  and incorporate com chipsets into their products 
the company expects that the trend toward increasing oem sales will continue 
as a result  the company s future operating results are dependent  in part  on the company s ability to establish  maintain and strengthen relationships with oems 
because sales to oems are typically at lower prices and result in lower margins to the company  the company s sales and gross margins may be adversely impacted if  as the company expects  oems continue to become a larger percentage of the business 
product integration 
certain oems in the pc industry have  from time to time  chosen to integrate networking and modem functions on the pc motherboard 
for example  the company currently sells networking chipsets to dell computer which are integrated directly onto the pc motherboard of dell s high end optiplex line of pcs 
while no clear long term trend has emerged  should integration become a trend  the company s future sales growth could be adversely impacted 
reliance on suppliers 
some key components of the company s products are currently available only from single or limited sources 
in addition  certain of the company s suppliers are competitors of the company 
while the company has generally been able to obtain adequate supplies of components from existing sources  there can be no assurance that in the future the company s suppliers will be able to meet the company s demand for components in a timely and cost effective manner 
the company s business  operating results  financial condition or customer relationships could be adversely affected by either an increase in prices for  or an interruption or reduction in supply of  key components 
international markets 
the company operates internationally and expects that international markets will continue to account for a significant percentage of the company s sales 
many international markets are characterized by economic and political instability and currency fluctuations that can adversely affect the company s operating results or financial condition 
the recent instability in the asian financial markets has negatively impacted the company s sales in those markets by  among other things  decreasing end user purchases  increasing competition from local competitors offering sales terms in local currencies  and reducing access to sources of capital needed by customers to make purchases 
in addition to reducing sales  difficulties in asia have subjected the company s resellers to financial difficulties and may increase the company s credit risk as customers become insolvent or otherwise have their ability to meet obligations impaired 
should the economic environment in asia fail to improve  the company may consider continuing to expand its exposure to foreign currencies to preserve long term customer relationships 
there can be no assurance that the instability in asia will not continue to have an adverse effect on the company s operating results 
in addition  there is no assurance that similar situations in other markets will not occur and adversely impact the company 
in particular  significant fluctuations in foreign currency could have an adverse impact on the company s sales and or foreign currency exchange exposures 
ability to satisfy product orders 
the timing and amount of the company s sales are dependent on a number of factors that make estimating operating results prior to the end of any period uncertain 
for example  the company does not typically maintain a significant backlog and  as a result  product sales in any quarter are dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
in addition  the company s customers historically request fulfillment of orders in a short period of time  resulting in limited visibility to sales trends 
as a result  the company s operating results depend on the volume and timing of orders and the company s ability to fulfill the orders in a timely manner 
the company s results of operations or financial condition would be adversely affected if incoming order rates decline  if ordered products are not readily available  or if the company is not able to immediately fill orders 
from time to time  the company has shipped a significant percentage of its products in the third month of a fiscal quarter 
this subjects the company to risks such as unexpected disruptions in functions including manufacturing  order management  information systems and shipping 
should the percentage of sales in the third month of a quarter escalate  or should a significant disruption in the company s functions occur  there could be an adverse affect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
inventory 
in recent periods  the company s inventory has been higher than historical levels 
high levels of inventory increase the exposure to the company when products in inventory become obsolete or otherwise not saleable 
while the company expects to reduce the level of its inventory over time  there can be no assurance that it will be successful in doing so  or that products in the company s inventory will not become obsolete 
failure to adequately manage the levels of inventory could adversely impact the company s operating results or financial condition 
product warranties 
the company s products are covered by warranties  and the company is subject to contractual commitments to perform under such warranties 
if unexpected circumstances arise such that products do not perform as intended and the company is not successful in resolving product quality or performance issues  there could be an adverse impact on the operating results or financial condition of the company 
intellectual property rights 
the company has received  and may continue to receive  notice of claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights 
many of the company s competitors  in particular the traditional telecommunications companies  have large patent portfolios 
the company  from time to time  must negotiate licenses or cross licenses with third parties to obtain rights to incorporate proprietary technologies  protocols or specifications 
any failure by the company to obtain and maintain licenses  on favorable terms  for intellectual property rights required for the manufacture  sale and use of its products  particularly those which must comply with industry standard protocols and specifications to be commercially viable  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
the company may be subject to litigation based on claimed infringement of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
any such litigation could be costly and cause diversion of management s attention  either of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
adverse determinations in such litigation could subject the company to significant liabilities  require the company to seek licenses from others  or prevent the company from manufacturing and selling its products  any one of which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
electronic commerce and electronic data interchange edi 
many vendors  distributors and resellers have been successful in the direct sale of products to customers who wish to order products on the internet or through edi 
these trends have enabled manufacturers to increase business volume and lower their cost structures 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully implement or continue to expand such systems in a timely manner  and a failure to do so could adversely affect results of operations or financial condition 
dependence on key personnel and recruiting 
the success of the company will depend to a significant extent upon a number of key technical employees and management 
the loss of the services of key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
in addition  recruiting and retaining skilled personnel  including qualified engineers  is highly competitive 
if the company cannot successfully recruit and retain skilled personnel  the company s financial results may be adversely affected 
year compliance 
as is true for most companies  the year computer issue creates a risk for com 
if systems do not correctly recognize date information when the year changes to  there could be an adverse impact on the company s operations 
the risk for com exists in four areas systems used by the company to run its business  systems used by the company s suppliers  potential warranty or other claims from com customers  and the potential reduced spending by other companies on networking solutions as a result of significant information systems spending on year remediation 
the company is currently evaluating its exposure in all of these areas 
com is in the process of conducting a comprehensive inventory and evaluation of the information systems used to run its business 
com has a number of projects underway to replace older systems that are known to be year non compliant 
other systems  which are identified as non compliant  will be upgraded or replaced 
for the year non compliance issues identified to date  the cost of remediation is not expected to be material to the company s operating results 
however  if implementation of replacement systems is delayed  or if significant new non compliance issues are identified  the company s results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
com is also in the process of contacting its critical suppliers to determine that the suppliers operations and the products and services they provide are year compliant 
where practicable  com will attempt to mitigate its risks with respect to the failure of suppliers to be year ready 
however  such failures remain a possibility and could have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the company believes its current products are year compliant  however  since all customer situations cannot be anticipated  particularly those involving third party products  com may see an increase in warranty and other claims as a result of the year transition 
in addition  litigation regarding year compliance issues is expected to escalate 
for these reasons  the impact of customer claims could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
year compliance is an issue for virtually all businesses  whose computer systems and applications may require significant hardware and software upgrades or modifications 
companies owning and operating such systems may plan to devote a substantial portion of their information systems spending to fund such upgrades and modifications and divert spending away from networking solutions 
such changes in customers spending patterns could have a material adverse impact on the company s sales  operating results or financial condition 
fluctuations in quarterly results 
the company s operating results for any particular quarter are difficult to predict and may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations 
these fluctuations can be caused by a wide variety of factors  including the volume and timing of orders  the introduction and acceptance of new products and technologies  price competition  general conditions and trends in the networking industry and technology sector  disruption in international markets  general economic conditions  and extraordinary events such as industry consolidation  acquisitions  or litigation 
for example  the first quarter of the fiscal year has traditionally been the company s lowest sales quarter  as it includes the three summer months of june  july and august 
these factors  and accompanying fluctuations in periodic operating results  could have a significant adverse impact on the market price of the company s common stock

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures 
the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity security price risk 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
the company maintains a short term investment portfolio consisting mainly of income securities with an average maturity of less than two years 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at may   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
the company has the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore the company would not expect its operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on its securities portfolio 
at may   the company had approximately million of outstanding obligations under certain real estate lease arrangements with monthly payments tied to short term interest rates 
if short term interest rates were to increase percent  the increased lease payments associated with these arrangements would not have a material impact on the company s net income or cash flows 
in addition  the company also had fixed rate long term debt of approximately million  and a hypothetical percent decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair market value of this debt 
the company does not hedge any interest rate exposures 
foreign currency exchange risk 
the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain balance sheet exposures and intercompany balances against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
gains and losses on the forward contracts are largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying exposure 
a hypothetical percent appreciation of the us dollar from may  market rates would increase the unrealized value of the company s forward contracts by million 
conversely  a hypothetical percent depreciation of the us dollar from may  market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the company s forward contracts by million 
in either scenario  the gains or losses on the forward contracts are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions and consequently a sudden or significant change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on future net income or cash flows 
equity price risk 
the company holds a small portfolio of marketable equity traded securities that are subject to market price volatility 
equity price fluctuations of plus or minus percent would not have a material impact on the company
