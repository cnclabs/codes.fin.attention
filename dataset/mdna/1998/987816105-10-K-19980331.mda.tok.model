item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ysi operates programs designed to provide educational and rehabilative services to adjudicated youth 
as of december   ysi operated residential juvenile justice programs in nine states 
as of december   the company also operated two behavorial health programs which are being held for sale 
see recent developments for further discussion of the company s writedown and disposition of seven behavioral health programs on october  revenues are derived from the company s operation of its juvenile justice programs pursuant to contracts with governmental entities and management agreements with private operators which are generally not for profit entities that contract with governmental entities 
generally  the company s contracts provide for per diem payments based upon program occupancy 
the company recognizes revenues from its fixed per diem and management contracts when the company performs the services pursuant to such contracts 
one of the company s significant programs operates under a contract whereby revenues are recognized as reimbursable costs are incurred through a gross maximum price cost reimbursement arrangement 
under this contract  contract revenues are recorded at amounts that are expected to be realized 
this contract has certain costs subject to audit and adjustment as determined through negotiations with government representatives 
subsequent adjustments  if any  resulting from the audit process are recorded when known 
program direct operating expenses are principally comprised of salaries and related benefits of personnel  insurance  security expenses  transportation costs  depreciation  meal costs and rent  utilities and other occupancy expenses associated with the operation of the company s programs at its facilities 
start up costs are principally comprised of expenses associated with the hiring and training of staff required to obtain licensing prior to admitting students into a new program 
contribution from operations consists of revenues minus program direct operating expenses and start up costs 
contribution from operations  in general  is lower in the initial stages of a program s development primarily because of start up costs and other costs incurred during the period prior to the achievement of stable occupancy 
contribution from operations as a percentage of revenue is greater under some of the company s contracts with unaffiliated  not for profit entities because the not for profit entities are responsible for certain elements of operating the programs and incur some of the costs 
therefore  in these instances  the company earns its margin on a lower base of revenues and expenses 
development costs are principally comprised of payroll and travel costs for personnel associated with the company s efforts to grow by expansion into new markets 
general and administrative costs are principally comprised of salaries and related benefits of personnel  insurance and rent  utilities and other occupancy expenses associated with the operation of the company s executive offices and the management of the company and its subsidiaries
