item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction cb commercial real estate services group  inc the company is the largest commercial real estate services firm in the united states and a global leader in real estate services 
over the course of the last five years the company  in recognition of a rapidly changing structural and economic environment  has changed from being almost exclusively a traditional real estate broker to being a highly diversified real estate services firm 
its outsourcing  transaction management  advisory services and facilities management business referred to as corporate services  property management business institutional management services and its mortgage loan origination and servicing  appraisal  investment property  realty advisory and capital markets businesses collectively referred to as financial services are either the largest or one of the largest such businesses in the country and in the aggregate accounted for more than million in revenue 
the company s core brokerage business  commercial property sales and leasing brokerage services accounted for approximately million in revenue and is the largest or one of the largest such businesses in the country 
as part of its proactive adjustment to structural and economic changes in the economy the company has  since the beginning of  completed a million public offering of common stock and six strategic acquisitions with a seventh a major international acquisition in process 
the company is continually assessing acquisition opportunities as part of its growth strategy 
because of the substantial non cash goodwill and intangible amortization charges incurred by the company in connection with acquisitions subject to purchase accounting and because of interest expense associated with acquisition financing  past acquisitions have and future acquisitions may adversely affect net income 
in addition  during the first six months following an acquisition  the company believes there are generally significant one time costs relating to integrating information technology  accounting and management services and rationalizing personnel levels which the company intends to reflect as a statement of operations charge or as part of the purchase price at the time of the acquisition as appropriate 
management s strategy is to pursue acquisitions that are expected to be accretive to income before interest expense and provision for amortization of goodwill and intangibles  if any  and to operating cash flows excluding the costs of integration 
revenue from brokerage services and the investment properties component of financial services  which constitutes a substantial majority of the company s revenue  is largely transactional in nature and subject to economic cycles 
however  the company s significant size  geographic coverage  number of transactions and large continuing client base tend to minimize the impact of economic cycles on annual revenue and create what the company believes is equivalent to a recurring stream of revenue 
between and of the costs and expenses associated with brokerage services and the investment properties component of financial services are directly correlated to revenue while approximately of the costs and expenses of corporate services  institutional management services and financial services  excluding investment properties  are directly correlated to revenue 
a significant portion of the company s revenue is seasonal 
historically  this seasonality has caused the company s revenue  operating income and net income to be lower in the first two calendar quarters and higher in the third and fourth calendar quarters of each year 
in addition  the company s operations are directly affected by actual and perceived trends in various national and economic conditions  including interest rates  the availability of credit to finance commercial real estate transactions and the impact of tax laws 
to date  the company does not believe that general inflation has had a material impact upon its operations 
revenues  commissions and other variable costs related to revenues are primarily affected by real estate market supply and demand rather than general inflation 
results of operations the following table sets forth items derived from the company s consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   and  presented in dollars and as a percentage of revenue 
year ended december  dollars in thousands revenue    costs and expenses commissions  fees and other incentives    operating  administrative and other    merger related and other non recurring charges  depreciation and amortization    operating income    interest income    interest expense    income before provision benefit for income tax    provision for income tax   reduction of valuation allowances  net provision benefit for income tax   income loss before extraordinary items    extraordinary items  net net income    ebitda    since  the company s results have benefitted from its ability to take advantage of a significant and ongoing recovery in us commercial real estate markets and the generally rising occupancy and rental levels  and  as a result  property values 
since brokerage fees are typically based upon a percentage of transaction value  and property management fees are typically based upon a percentage of total rent collections  recent occupancy and rental rate increases at the property level have generated an increase in brokerage and property management fees to the company 
the company reported consolidated net income of million diluted earnings per share in  on revenues of million 
reflected in the consolidated net income are merger related and other non recurring charges of million  million in amortization related to the write off of langdon rieder acquisition goodwill and an extraordinary loss of million net of a tax benefit of million resulting from debt extinguishment 
excluding these charges and their related tax impact  the company s consolidated net income would have been million or of revenue and diluted earnings would have been per share 
revenues on a consolidated basis were million  an increase of million or for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the overall increase reflected a continued improvement in the commercial real estate markets across the country  the acquisition of koll real estate services koll at the end of august and a full year of revenue from lj melody company lj melody which was acquired in july of this improvement reflected both the company s position and increasing confidence in the national economy and  in particular  real estate assets and improving real estate market liquidity 
commissions  fees and other incentives on a consolidated basis were million  an increase of million or for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in these costs is attributable both to the increase in revenue since most of the company s sales professionals are compensated based on revenue and to an increasing number of sales personnel becoming entitled to commissions at a rate above 
as a percentage of revenue  commissions fees and other incentives were in and operating  administrative and other on a consolidated basis was million  an increase of million or for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  this is consistent with increased operating activity  and reflects a decrease in operating  administrative and other as a percentage of revenue from to 
merger related and other non recurring charges were million for the year ended december  these charges represent million of accrued merger costs  million of merger related incentive payments to certain westmark sellers and million related to an accelerated contingent note payment 
consolidated interest income was million  an increase of million or for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   which directly relates to increased cash balances 
consolidated interest expense was million  a decrease of million or for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the decrease is the result of the payment of a portion of the senior debt with the net proceeds from the company s initial public offering in late offering  a reduction in interest rates due to debt refinancing in late august  and other pay downs during interest expense for is expected to increase as a result of the repurchase in january of of all of the company s preferred stock and the debt expected to be associated with acquisitions 
net provision for income tax on a consolidated basis in was million  compared to a million benefit for the provision is the result of positive pre tax income and the use of the full effective tax rate  whereas the benefit in resulted primarily from the recognition of a portion of the company s net operating loss nol carryforwards and other deferred tax assets by reversing the related valuation allowance 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for discussion of the company s deferred taxes and related valuation allowances 
in early the company repurchased its outstanding preferred stock and triggered a limitation on the annual amount of nol it can use to offset future taxable income 
this limitation does not affect the way taxes are reported for financial reporting purposes  but it will affect the actual amount of taxes paid 
extraordinary items of million relate to the write off of deferred loan costs due to extinguishment of certain senior and senior subordinated debt 
the amount is net of a tax benefit of million 
there were no corresponding charges incurred in ebitda was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  ebitda effectively removes the impact of certain non cash and non recurring charges on income such as depreciation and the amortization of intangible assets relating to acquisitions  merger related and other non recurring charges  extraordinary items  and income taxes 
management believes that the presentation of ebitda will enhance a reader s understanding of the company s operating performance and ability to service debt as it provides a measure of cash subject to the payment of interest and income taxes generated that can be used by the company to service its debt and other required or discretionary purposes 
net cash that will be available to the company for discretionary purposes represents remaining cash  after debt service and other cash requirements  such as capital expenditures  are deducted from ebitda 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to i operating income determined in accordance with gaap or ii operating cash flow determined in accordance with gaap 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated net income for the year ended december  was million diluted earnings per share  which included the current year tax provision of million offset by the cumulative year to date tax benefit resulting from reversal of valuation allowances of million or a net benefit for income tax of million

this improvement reflected increasing investor confidence  increasing prices and a more liquid market than in prior years resulting from declining vacancy levels and the return of some bargaining power to landlords 
commissions  fees and other incentives on a consolidated basis in were million  an increase of million or from million in the increase in these costs is largely correlated to the increase in revenue since most of the company s sales professionals are compensated based on revenue 
as a percentage of revenue  commissions fees and other incentives decreased from in to in the decrease in commissions  fees and other incentives as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to the significant revenue growth in investment management and advisory  which does not incur this type of revenue based expense 
excluding investment management and advisory  commissions  fees and other incentives were relatively flat as a percentage of revenues 
operating  administrative and other on a consolidated basis in was million  an increase of million or from million in  and a decrease as a percentage of revenue from for to for consolidated interest income in was million  a decrease of million or from million in consolidated interest expense in was million  an increase of million or from million in primarily resulting from debt incurred with respect to the westmark acquisition in june and the lj melody acquisition in july  offset in part by reduced average borrowing levels on other company indebtedness and paydown of a portion of the senior debt with the net proceeds from the offering 
net provision benefit for income tax on a consolidated basis in was a benefit of million  compared to a million provision in during the third quarter of  the company projected  on a more likely than not basis  that a portion of its nol would be realizable in future periods and  accordingly  reduced its existing deferred tax asset valuation allowances by million of which million was allocated to the purchase price of lj melody based on its estimated future potential to generate taxable income  and the remaining million was recorded as a tax benefit a reduction in income tax provision 
during the fourth quarter of  the company further reduced its deferred tax asset valuation allowances by million based on its ability to generate additional taxable income in the future through interest savings resulting from the paydown of part of its senior secured and senior subordinated debt with proceeds from the offering 
this reduction has also been recorded as a tax benefit resulting in a cumulative year to date tax benefit of million 
with the recognition of deferred tax assets  the future period provisions for income tax will be recorded at the full effective tax rate excluding the impact of other adjustments  if any  to valuation allowances 
for the year ended december   a million provision for income taxes was recorded without regard to the income tax benefit resulting from the reduction of the valuation allowance 
net income for the year ended december  was million diluted earnings per share  which includes the current year provision of million offset by the cumulative year to date tax benefit of million or a net benefit for income tax of million 
if the company had not recorded tax benefits related to projected future taxable income for the year ended december   the company s net income for such period would have been million diluted earnings per share 
the million recognized tax benefit has a material effect on the reported net income for the year ended december  this million tax benefit is a non recurring item and is unrelated to the company s performance and should not be used in evaluating the company s prospects or future performance

in reaching this conclusion  management considered the company s past operating results  the current year events and trends  including the impact  if any  of the acquisitions that were concluded during the year and other factors 
management evaluates the appropriateness of all or part of these valuation allowances on a periodic basis and if the company concludes there is a change with respect to realizability  any necessary adjustments are made at that time 
the ability of the company to utilize nols will be limited in and subsequent years as a result of the company s public offering  the koll acquisition and the repurchase of preferred stock which cumulatively caused a more than change of ownership within a three year period 
as a result of the limitation  the company will only be able to use approximately million of its nol in and each subsequent year
