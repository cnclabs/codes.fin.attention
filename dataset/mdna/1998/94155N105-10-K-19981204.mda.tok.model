item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is an international provider of integrated water purification and wastewater treatment solutions  principally to industrial and municipal customers 
waterlink was incorporated in delaware on december  and has grown externally by completing thirteen acquisitions and internally through industry wide expansion as well as company sponsored programs 
on june   the company consummated its initial public offering of  shares of its common stock at a price of per share  before the underwriters discount  and received approximately million of net proceeds 
on july   the company sold  shares of its common stock pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option granted in connection with the initial public offering  and received approximately million 
these net proceeds from the initial public offering were primarily used to pay the cash portion of the purchase prices of bioclear  lanco and meva  to repay indebtedness of the company and for general working capital purposes 
the company s acquisitions have enabled it to build its technical capabilities and geographical presence 
through september   the company completed the following acquisitions at the following effective dates sanborn technologies march  great lakes august  mass transfer january  aero mod april  waterlink technologies september  nordic group march  bioclear june  lanco june  meva september  hycor september  c treat march  aes purac march  carbons group june  as part of its strategic plan  the company intends to continue its acquisition program 
the company s acquisition program targets businesses which provide the company with complementary systems  equipment and services  and broadens its customer and geographic base 
in addition  the company seeks companies that provide the potential for synergies with existing businesses 
with respect to the acquisitions completed to date  the company has begun to identify and act upon opportunities to cross sell systems  equipment and services 
as a result of the increased financial  managerial and other resources provided by the company to its acquired businesses  the company expects its internal growth rate to be a positive influence on its growth strategy 
the company also expects that it will continue to benefit from such synergies as it continues to more fully integrate the acquired businesses into its operations 
all acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and are included in the results of operations for the period subsequent to the effective date of acquisition 
due to the timing and magnitude of these acquisitions  results of operations for the periods presented are not necessarily comparable or indicative of operating results for current or future periods 
the majority of the company s systems and equipment are custom designed and take a number of months to produce 
revenues from large contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting in the proportion that costs bear to total estimated costs at completion 
revisions of estimated costs or potential contract losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which they are determined 
provisions are made currently for all known or anticipated losses 
variations from estimated contract performance could result in a material adjustment to operating results for any fiscal quarter or year 
claims for extra work or changes in scope of work are included in revenues when collection is probable 
revenues from remaining systems and equipment sales are recognized when shipped 
in the past the company has experienced quarterly fluctuations in operating results due to the contractual nature of its business and the consequent timing of these orders 
as part of its strategic plan  the company expects that in the future it may receive contracts that are significantly larger than those received by the company historically 
in addition  certain of such contracts will be subject to the customer s ability to finance  or fund from government sources  the actual costs of completing the project as well as receiving any necessary permits to commence the project 
therefore  the company expects that its future operating results could fluctuate significantly  especially on a quarterly basis  due to the timing of the awarding of such contracts  the ability to fund project costs  and the recognition by the company of revenues and profits therefrom 
in addition  the company has historically operated with a moderate backlog 
however  as a result of its strategic plan  the company anticipates that both the dollar volume and number of contracts in its backlog will increase significantly 
as of september   the company s backlog was approximately million 
in addition  the company also had million of firm commitments to purchase recurring revenue products from its recently acquired carbons group at september  therefore  quarterly sales and operating results may be affected by the volume and timing of contracts received and performed within the quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
any significant deferral or cancellation of a contract could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results in any particular quarter 
because of these factors  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its operating results are not necessarily indicative of future performances 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated  statements of operations data as a percentage of net sales fiscal fiscal fiscal net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses special charges amortization operating income loss other income expense interest expense interest income and other items net income loss before income taxes income taxes income loss before extraordinary item extraordinary item  net of tax net income loss year ended september  compared to year ended september  net sales 
net sales for the year ended september  were  an increase of  from the prior year 
the increase was due to the timing of the acquisitions previously described 
the company experienced negative internal growth for the year of  resulting principally from the timing of orders  exchange rate fluctuations and stronger performance for certain domestic companies during fiscal that was not duplicated in fiscal the company measures internal growth by comparing each subsidiary s net sales from the months subsequent to their respective acquisition dates during the prior year to those same months in the current year 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended september  was  an increase of  from the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to the aforementioned acquisitions

special charges

the company recorded a non cash charge of  consisting of  related to the impairment of goodwill associated with the june bioclear acquisition and  to write off the cumulative translation adjustment component of bioclear s equity 
with regard to the  impairment charge  the plan includes the company s decision to exit the acquired business of bioclear 
several factors lead to this decision including i 
the lack of orders at bioclear in fiscal led to a comprehensive market review  which was completed in august this analysis indicated that bioclear s originally perceived niche market was not reliable and possibly nonexistent 
ii 
in order to compete in more traditional markets  bioclear s proprietary product would need to be reengineered  at great expense  to significantly reduce the water treatment cost per gallon 
in addition  this reengineered proprietary product would not guarantee success due to the extremely competitive traditional marketplace 
iii 
in july  bioclear s founder  a former owner and president  resigned 
iv 
in august  bioclear s chief engineer and a former owner announced his desire to reduce his involvement to part time  making the reengineering effort more difficult 
having made the decision to exit the business  the remaining goodwill associated with the bioclear acquisition is not recoverable based on bioclear s lack of future undiscounted cash flows and is impaired 
once the impairment was determined  the company obtained an independent appraisal of the fair value of the bioclear business 
this appraisal indicated no value for the business above the identified tangible net assets 
as a result  the company wrote off the unamortized balance of goodwill of  since this was deemed to be a substantially complete liquidation of an investment in a foreign entity  the company also wrote off  of the cumulative translation adjustment relating to bioclear s equity 
the company incurred a special charge of  primarily attributable to contractual obligations of the company to its former president and chief executive officer  who resigned in june the company incurred special charges of  for the year ended september  resulting primarily from the issuance  concurrent with the initial public offering  of a ten year option to purchase  shares of common stock at a price of per share to an officer of the company pursuant to terms of an employment agreement

net sales for the year ended september  were  an increase of  from the prior year

in addition  internal growth accounted for  of the increase  which represented an internal growth rate of  primarily due to expansion in overseas markets and to the greater levels of resources provided by the company to the businesses subsequent to the acquisitions 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended september  was  an increase of  from the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to its acquisitions and internal growth

selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended september  were  an increase of  from the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to the aforementioned acquisitions 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was for as compared to for this decrease primarily reflects the spreading of selling  general and administrative expenses over a larger revenue base 
special charges

extraordinary item 
during the year ended september   the company recorded an extraordinary charge of  net of taxes of  related to the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with certain indebtedness retired with the net proceeds from  and discounts associated with a note purchase agreement terminated in connection with  its initial public offering 
liquidity and capital resources since its inception  the company s primary sources of liquidity have been i borrowings available under credit facilities  ii net proceeds from the sale of the company s common and preferred stock  iii issuance of common stock and seller financing incurred in connection with the company s completed acquisitions  and iv cash flow from certain profitable operations 
historically  the company s primary uses of capital have been the funding of its acquisition program  working capital requirements including the funding for growth at certain acquisitions and the funding required for certain under performing operations 
the company does not currently anticipate making significant capital investments in plant and equipment due to its focus on partnering with vendors who manufacture most of the components used in the company s systems and equipment 
for the year ended september   net cash used by operating activities was  purchases of equipment totaled  and purchases of businesses  net of cash acquired  totaled  these cash outlays  financed primarily by long term borrowings  reflect the cash purchase price of acquisitions as well as additional payments made during the period related to acquisitions  expansion of working capital requirements and purchases of equipment for existing operations 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company s board of directors approved the plan which calls for the reorganization of the company from a holding company comprised of twenty three operating companies into five integrated divisions that focus on specific market segments 
this plan  which will eliminate redundant costs and improve operating efficiencies  is anticipated to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal the plan includes costs associated with the exiting of certain facilities and employee termination costs 
costs associated with this plan of approximately  were recognized during fiscal  of which approximately  is reserved for future payment at september  other costs associated with the plan of approximately  which do not meet the criteria for recognition at september   are expected to be recognized in fiscal additionally  in conjunction with its plan  the company recorded a  non cash charge  primarily related to the impairment of goodwill associated with the june bioclear acquisition 
at september   the company had approximately  of long lived assets recorded at its bioclear subsidiary  which represents the fair value utilizing an independent appraisal  comprised primarily of property  plant and equipment 
the company is evaluating the most favorable means to divest of the remaining assets of bioclear  primarily related to its manufacturing facility in winnipeg  canada 
at the present time the company is attempting to sell the entire bioclear business  a purchaser of which has not yet been identified 
if the company is unsuccessful in selling the entire bioclear business in a reasonable time frame  the company will most likely close the facility  terminate the remaining eleven employees  and sell the building and individual pieces of manufacturing and office equipment in an orderly fashion 
the company also incurred a special charge in during the third quarter of fiscal of approximately  primarily attributable to contractual obligations of the company to its former president and chief executive officer  who resigned in june  and the costs necessary to recruit executives to the company 
approximately  of this charge is reserved for future payment at september  the company intends to continue pursuing attractive acquisition opportunities 
the timing  size or success of any acquisition effort and the associated potential capital commitments are unpredictable 
on june   concurrent with the acquisition of the carbons group  the company amended and restated its then existing  domestic revolving credit with bank of america national trust savings association as agent by entering into a  secured  domestic facility  comprised of a  revolving facility and a  term loan new domestic facility 
on september   the new domestic facility was amended to allow for the implementation of the plan described above and the company reduced the new domestic facility to  comprised of a  revolving facility and a  term loan amended domestic facility 
as a result of the carbons group acquisition and the implementation of the plan  the company has caused its current and long term debt to be in excess of stockholder s equity and bears the risks associated with increased leverage 
the company believes that through the end of fiscal  i future cash flow from operations  ii borrowings under the credit facilities described above or as amended  iii issuance of subordinated indebtedness  common stock and seller financing incurred in connection with future acquisitions or financings and iv the sale of certain underperforming assets will be sufficient to fund its working capital needs  additional cash requirements of the plan  acquisitions and additional contingent consideration related to acquisitions 
acquisitions 
during the twelve months ended september   the company completed three acquisitions for an aggregate consideration of  comprised of  of cash and  of seller financing in the form of convertible debt 
in addition  contingent consideration payments totaling  were made in connection with acquisitions made prior to under the terms of certain of the purchase agreements  the company may be required to make additional purchase consideration payments of up to  contingent upon the achievement of specified operating results through fiscal the payments that are expected to be required for meeting fiscal and targets are  and  respectively 
any such additional purchase consideration payments will be treated as additional goodwill for accounting purposes 
the company  from time to time  has and expects to make in the future strategic investments in industry related companies 
during fiscal the company invested in aquatec water systems  incorporated aquatec  a designer and manufacturer of specialized multi chamber pumps for the pure water industry  in the form of a  subordinated debt instrument 
this investment is convertible into approximately of the equity of aquatec 
the company also has the option to purchase at anytime through march the remaining equity of aquatec at a pre determined formula based on earnings 
the company will determine during fiscal whether to retain its investment in aquatec 
credit availability 
the company currently has a  amended domestic facility with bank of america national trust savings association as agent  which expires on may  in connection with this facility  the company also has separate facilities at three of its overseas subsidiaries aggregating  the amended domestic facility and the three overseas facilities amended credit facilities will be utilized to fund operating activities of the company as well as future acquisitions 
loans under the amended credit facilities bear interest at a designated variable base rate plus spreads ranging from to basis points depending on the ratio of total consolidated indebtedness to the company s earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
at the company s option  the amended credit facilities bear interest based on a designated london interbank offering rate libor plus spreads ranging from to basis points  depending on the company s aforementioned leverage ratio 
the amended credit facilities restricts or prohibits the company from taking many actions  including paying dividends and incurring or assuming other indebtedness or liens 
the banks that participate in the amended credit facilities also must approve most acquisitions 
the company s obligations under the credit facility are secured by liens on substantially all of the company s domestic assets  including equipment  inventory  accounts receivable and general intangibles and the pledge of most of the stock of the company s subsidiaries 
the company has guaranteed the payment by its three overseas subsidiaries of their obligations under the overseas facilities 
the three overseas subsidiaries have given a negative pledge of their assets in connection with the overseas facilities 
availability for future borrowings under the credit facility is based on a multiple of the company s pro forma earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
at september   approximately  was available for future borrowings under the amended credit facilities 
availability for future borrowings may increase or decrease based on the pro forma operating performance of the company 
the company also has in place a  credit facility canadian line of credit with royal bank of canada to fund canadian working capital requirements including banker s acceptances and letters of credit 
interest rates are negotiated on an individual borrowing basis and are related to the royal bank of canada s prime rate 
borrowings are payable upon demand and are guaranteed by bioclear 
at september   the canadian line of credit was fully utilized 
the company s earnings are affected by changes in interest rates related to its amended domestic facility 
during  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a major commercial bank to modify the interest characteristics of its amended domestic facility 
the agreement involves the exchange of amounts based on a fixed rate of interest for an amount based on a libor based floating rate over the life of the agreement without an exchange of the notional amount upon which the payments are based 
the agreement  which expires on december   fixes the company s libor based rate at on a notional amount of  if libor averaged less in fiscal than the fiscal year end rate  the company s interest expense  after considering the effects of the interest rate swap  would not be materially impacted due to the interest rate swap agreement 
the impact was determined by considering the hypothetical impact of interest rates on the amended domestic facility and interest rate swap agreement 
the analysis does not consider the effects of the overall economic environment associated with such a change nor does it assume any change to the company s current financial structure 
see note of the company s audited financial statements for further discussion regarding the company s use of derivative financial instruments 
year the year issue  as widely reported  could cause malfunctions in certain computer related applications with respect to dates on or after january  these malfunctions could relate to information technology it or non it environments 
due to the company s decentralized it environments  individual assessments  in accordance with the company s year program  have been conducted at the company s operating companies 
collectively  these assessments indicate that the company s exposure to this segment of the year issue is not significant as the company does not extensively rely on it systems which require modification 
the company s externally developed system issues have been assessed company wide through inquiry of its major external vendors and testing procedures where necessary 
the appropriate upgrades  if required  have been or are scheduled to be attained in order to make these systems year compliant 
the company has tested internally developed software systems where applicable and have developed programs to make these systems year compliant 
testing of upgraded or modified systems has begun at the company s various operating units 
results of these testing procedures  which are scheduled to be completed by the end of fiscal  are incomplete 
the year program also addresses issues related to non it environments 
collectively  these assessments indicate that the company s exposure to this segment of the year issue is not significant due to the company s limited manufacturing operations and related capital equipment needs 
the company s operating equipment has been assessed through inquiry of its major external manufacturers and internal testing procedures 
remediation efforts have begun where necessary 
collectively  the company intends to complete and test remediated assets by the end of fiscal the company s primary system interface with an external party involves its banking institutions 
based on inquiries of its banking institutions  the company is not aware of any unresolved year issues 
further  due to the company s decentralized operations  individual assessments  in accordance with the company s year program  have been conducted at the company s operating companies regarding significant suppliers and subcontractors 
these assessments  which are not complete  have been executed primarily through inquiry of its various suppliers and subcontractors 
to date  the company is not aware of any external party with an unresolved year issue that would materially impact the company s operations and financial position 
however  the company has no means of ensuring that external parties will be year compliant 
the inability of external parties to resolve their year issue in a timely manner could impact the company s operations and financial position 
the effect of non compliance by external parties is not determinable 
the company has utilized primarily internal resources to assess  test  remediate and implement software and equipment related to the year the total cost of the company s year program  excluding employee salaries  is estimated at  primarily attributable to software upgrades and modifications 
the company has incurred approximately  related to the various phases of its year program 
management of the company believes that it has a program established to resolve the year issue in a timely manner 
collectively  the company s year program has not been completed 
in the event the company does not complete its remaining year procedures  certain functions may be interrupted 
the company does not have a formal contingency plan established if all phases of its year program are not completed 
however  appropriate actions  such as interim manual information systems  will be instituted to mitigate such interruption 
in addition  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from unresolved year issues could also materially adversely affect the company 
the potential liability and loss of revenue from these issues is not determinable 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 reporting comprehensive income  which establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components 
this statement is intended to address the concerns of financial statement users for the increasing number of items that bypass the income statement  such as foreign currency translation adjustments 
the statement is effective for the company in fiscal the company does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  which changes the way public companies report segment information in annual financial statements 
the statement also requires public companies to report selected segment information in interim financial reports to shareholders

forward looking statements with the exception of historical information  the matters discussed herein may include forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
while forward looking statements are sometimes presented with numerical specificity  they are based on variety of assumptions made by management regarding future circumstances over which the company has little or no control 
a number of important factors  including those identified in this section as well as factors discussed elsewhere herein  could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those in forward looking statements or financial information 
actual results may differ from forward looking results for a number of reasons  including the following i changes in economic conditions including  but not limited to  the potential instability of governments and legal systems in countries in which the company conducts business  significant changes in currency valuations  recessionary environments and year compliance issues relating to the company s program and external parties  including suppliers and customers  ii changes in customer demand as they affect sales and product mix including  but not limited to  the effect of strikes at customers facilities  variations in backlog  the impact of changes in industrial business cycles  and legislative changes that affect the municipal or industrial marketplace  iii competitive factors including  but not limited to  changes in market penetration and the introduction of new products by existing and new competitors  iv changes in operating costs including  but not limited to  the effect of changes in the company s manufacturing processes  changes in costs associated with varying levels of operations  changes resulting from different levels of customers demands  the effects of unplanned work stoppages  changes in cost of labor and benefits  and the cost and availability of raw materials and energy  v the success of the company s strategic plan including  but not limited to  its ability to achieve the total planned benefits of its plan including its ability to eliminate costs  improve operating efficiencies  and successfully divest of its bioclear subsidiary  its ability to find and integrate acquisitions into company operations  and the ability of recently acquired companies to meet satisfactory operating results  and vi unanticipated litigation  claims or assessments including  but not limited to  claims or problems related to product warranty and environmental issues 
potential fluctuations in quarterly results of operations 
we have experienced quarterly fluctuations in operating results due to the contractual nature of our business and  to a lesser extent  weather conditions 
we expect to receive contracts that are significantly larger than those received by us in the past 
in addition  certain contracts will be subject to our customer s ability to finance the project as well as to receive any necessary permits 
therefore  we expect that our future operating results could fluctuate significantly  especially on a quarterly basis 
our recognition of revenues and profits can fluctuate due to the timing of the awarding of such contracts and the ability to fund project costs 
in addition  we have historically operated with a moderate backlog 
as a result  our quarterly sales and operating results depend in part on the volume and timing of contracts received and performed within the quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
any significant deferral or cancellation of a contract could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in any particular period 
accordingly  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be necessarily indicative of future performance 
also  our operating results and stock price could be volatile  particularly on a quarterly basis 
limited combined operating history  risks of integration 
we were formed in december and have principally grown through acquisitions 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to integrate the operations of our various businesses and companies  including centralizing certain functions to achieve cost savings and developing programs and processes that will promote cooperation and the sharing of opportunities and resources among our businesses 
our new plan and our restructured organization are designed to promote this integration 
while the breadth and diversity of our products and services permit us to offer our customers single source solutions to water and wastewater treatment needs  this breadth and diversity also makes total integration more difficult 
we can not assure you that we will achieve our total integration goals or that our operating results will match or exceed the combined individual operating results achieved by our businesses prior to being acquired by us 
our management group has been assembled only relatively recently  with several key people joining us within the last twelve months 
we cannot assure you that management will be able to work together efficiently  implement our strategies and the plan effectively or direct us through a period of significant growth 
while we believe that our customers and targeted customers benefit from single source solutions to water and wastewater treatment needs  we cannot assure you that those customers will prefer the single source approach or that they will accept us as the provider of such solutions 
significant leverage 
we have significant leverage 
as of september   our total indebtedness was approximately  and our total shareholders equity was approximately  our degree of leverage could i increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions  ii limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital needs  acquisitions and other general corporate requirements  iii require a greater portion of our cash flow to go to interest and principal payments and reducing cash flow for other general corporate purposes  and iv limit our ability to react to changes in our business and industry 
while we believe that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs  including debt service  we can not assure you that general economic  financial  competitive or other factors will not result in our being in default of our debt obligations 
such a default  if not waived  could result in acceleration of our indebtedness and other adverse effects 
dependence on acquisitions for growth 
we intend to grow significantly by acquiring existing businesses 
this acquisition strategy involves risks inherent in assessing the values  strengths  weaknesses  risks and profitability of acquisition candidates 
these risks include adverse short term effects on our operating results  diversion of our management s attention  dependence on retaining  hiring and training key personnel  and risks associated with unanticipated problems or latent liabilities 
although we generally have been successful in acquiring companies we have pursued  we can not assurance you that acquisition opportunities will continue to be available  that we will have access to the capital required to finance potential acquisitions  that we will continue to acquire businesses or that we will integrate successfully into our operations any business we acquire 
in addition  to the extent that consolidation becomes more prevalent in our industry  the prices for attractive acquisition candidates may be bid up to higher levels and we can not assure you that businesses we acquire will achieve sales and profitability that justify our investment in them 
need for additional acquisition financing 
we currently intend to use a combination of our common stock  cash  and debt obligations in making future acquisitions 
the extent to which we will be able or willing to use our common stock for this purpose will depend on its market value from time to time and the willingness of potential sellers of acquisition targets to accept it as full or partial payment 
to the extent we are unable to use our common stock to make acquisitions  our ability to grow may be limited by the extent to which we are able to raise capital for this purpose  as well as to expand existing operations  through debt or additional equity financing 
at september   we had approximately  available under the amended credit facilities  to be used for acquisitions most of which would need to be approved by our bank  working capital and other corporate purposes 
we can not assure you that we will be able to obtain the capital we need to finance a successful acquisition program and our other cash needs 
operations outside the united states 
we sell a substantial proportion of our systems  equipment and services in western europe  latin america and other regions outside the united states 
also  a number of our divisions operate outside of the united states 
on an annualized pro forma basis  our net sales outside the united states were approximately of our pro forma fiscal net sales 
political  economic  regulatory and social conditions in foreign countries in which we operate may change 
risks associated with sales and operations in foreign countries include risks of war  expropriation or nationalization of assets  renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts  changing political conditions  changing laws and policies affecting trade  taxation and investment  overlap of different tax structures  and the general hazards associated with the assertion of sovereignty over certain areas in which operations are conducted 
we can not assure you that changes in political  economic  regulatory or social conditions will not have a substantial adverse effect on our business 
foreign currency risks 
because our functional currency is the united states dollar  our operations outside the united states sometime face the additional risks of fluctuating currency values and exchange rates  hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange 
we have operations outside the united states and are therefore hedged  to some extent  from foreign exchange risks because of our ability to purchase  manufacture and sell in the local currency of those jurisdictions 
we also enter into foreign currency contracts under certain circumstances to reduce our exposure to foreign exchange risks 
we can not assure you that our attempted matching of foreign currency receipts with disbursements or hedging activity will adequately moderate the risk of currency or exchange rate fluctuations 
in addition  to the extent we have operations outside the united states  we are subject to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and exchange rate charges on our reporting in our financial statements of the results from such operations outside the united states 
dependence on key personnel 
our business depends on our ability to hire and retain our executive officers and senior management 
our prospects could be adversely affected if  for any reason  any of our executive officers or senior management ceases active employment with us 
we will depend on the senior management of any significant businesses we acquire in the future to support our external growth and on our ability to attract qualified management to support our internal expansion 
our business or prospects could be affected adversely if any of these senior management of acquired businesses does not continue in his or her management role after joining us and if we are unable to attract and retain qualified replacements and additional members of management 
competition 
our industry  the water purification and wastewater treatment industry  is fragmented and highly competitive due to the large number of businesses within certain product areas 
we compete with many companies  several of which have greater market penetration  depth of product line  resources and access to capital  which could be competitive advantages in securing certain projects 
while we believe we are well positioned to deliver technology and services at a fair price  some of our competitors have developed product and service integration capabilities beyond our current scope 
we can not assure you that we can compete successfully in our market 
cyclicality of demand for water purification and wastewater equipment 
much of our water purification and wastewater equipment requires significant capital expenditures by our customers 
as such  the timing of customer purchases from us may be affected by various economic factors  including interest rate and business cycle fluctuations  which are beyond the our control 
the cyclical nature of capital equipment sales could have an adverse effect on the our revenues and profitability in general  and on the our revenues and profitability in any individual financial reporting period 
potential environmental liabilities 
in the united states  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of  as amended cercla or superfund  and comparable state laws  impose joint and several liability without fault for the releases of hazardous substances into the environment 
potentially responsible parties include i owners and operators of the site  ii parties which create the hazardous substances released at the site  and iii parties which arrange for the transportation or disposal of such hazardous substances 
we are also subject to applicable environmental laws in countries outside the united states where we operate or in which our customers are located 
these requirements and their enforcement may vary by country but in general prescribe standards for the protection of human health  safety and the environment 
we could face claims by governmental authorities  private individuals and other persons alleging that hazardous substances were released during the treatment process or from the use or disposal of end products and by products in violation of applicable law 
reliance on environmental regulation 
federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations impose substantial standards for properly purifying water and treating wastewater  and impose liabilities for noncompliance 
environmental laws and regulations are  and will continue to be  a significant factor affecting the marketability of our solutions  systems and equipment
