if the company s currently available funds and internally generated cash flow are not sufficient to satisfy its financing needs  the company would be required to seek additional funding through other arrangements with collaborative partners  through bank borrowings and through public or private sales of its securities  including equity securities

there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to identify all aspects of its business that are subject to year problems  or identify year problems of customers or suppliers that affect the company s business 
there also can be no assurance that the company s software vendors are correct in their assertions that the software is year compliant or that the company s estimate of the cost of systems preparation for year compliance will prove ultimately to be accurate 
risk factors the company wishes to caution readers that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s actual results and could cause the company s actual results for and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
page leverage the company s indebtedness is significant in relation to its stockholders equity 
such debt accounted for approximately of the company s total capitalization as of december  prior to its recent acquisitions  the company s revenues have been generally limited to non recurring research and development fees and license fees pursuant to the company s collaborative agreements and not from product sales 
the annual interest expense to the company relating to the debentures will be  assuming none of the debentures has been converted 
there can be no assurance that the company s revenue stream and earnings will be sufficient to enable the company to cover its interest obligations on the debentures or to enable it to repay principal upon maturity of the debentures 
history of operating losses and accumulated deficit the company has incurred net losses in each year since its inception  including net losses of approximately million during the year ended december  these losses have resulted in an accumulated deficit of million at december  the company expects to incur additional losses in the near term 
the company s ability to generate significant revenue and become profitable will be dependent in large part on the ability of the company to enter into additional collaborative agreements and on the ability of the company and its collaborators to successfully manufacture and commercialize products incorporating the company s technologies 
to date  the company has not received any significant revenue from sales of  or royalties from  products incorporating its proprietary technologies 
products in development stage currently  the company s soft chew calcium supplements are the only commercially available products utilizing the company s proprietary technology  and the company has not realized significant revenues from sales or royalties of products incorporating its proprietary technologies 
most of the company s potential product applications are in the research or development stage 
since inception  the company s operating revenue has consisted principally of research and development fees and license fees 
to achieve profitable operations  the company  alone or with others  must successfully complete development of its products  obtain any necessary regulatory approvals  complete manufacturing scale up and introduce and market its products 
product commercialization a component of the company s strategy is to leverage its proprietary technology to develop  manufacture and commercialize its own products 
such products include those that are subject to existing development and license agreements where the company has retained co exclusive manufacturing and marketing rights to the end user products and others that are the subject of self funded development programs of the company 
the development of commercial scale manufacturing facilities and marketing efforts by the company will require significant commitments of capital by the company 
although several of the businesses recently acquired by the company have manufacturing and marketing experience  prior to such acquisitions  the company has had limited manufacturing experience and no marketing experience 
there can be no assurance that the company can successfully develop or capitalize on such experience  or that the company s products will be accepted in the marketplace 
commercialization efforts by the company may compete with activities of the company s collaborative partners  most of which have greater financial resources than the company 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the company s active pursuit of its own efforts to develop and commercialize products using the company s proprietary technology will not otherwise adversely affect the company s relations with its existing and potential collaborative partners 
page acquisition risks one element of the company s strategy is to capitalize on retained co marketing rights by acquiring marketing and distribution organizations with existing product sales that the company believes have been or in the near term will be financially self sufficient and which it believes will serve as a platform to sell products incorporating the company s proprietary technologies 
the company has consummated five acquisitions since the beginning of and may consider additional transactions in the future 
there can be no assurance that any such transaction will be completed  that completed acquisitions will be successfully integrated or that  once integrated  such acquisitions will achieve levels of revenue  profitability or productivity comparable to those historically achieved by such acquired businesses or products or otherwise perform as expected 
acquisitions involve special risks  including risks associated with unanticipated liabilities and contingencies  diversion of management attention and possible adverse effects on earnings resulting from increased goodwill amortization  increased interest costs  the issuance of additional securities and difficulties related to the integration of the acquired business or products 
there can be no assurance that acquired entities will generate positive cash flows and or profits 
four of the businesses acquired by the company are located in europe 
foreign acquisitions may subject the company to the further risks of assimilating differences in foreign business practices  hiring and retaining qualified personnel  overcoming language barriers  limiting asset transfers  changes in foreign regulations and political turmoil 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able successfully to identify additional suitable acquisition candidates  complete additional acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses into its operations 
the failure to integrate acquired businesses into its operations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations  including cash flow 
limited manufacturing experience  risk of manufacturing scale up products incorporating the company s ceform or shearform technology have not been manufactured by the company or by its collaborative partners on a commercial scale and  to date  the company has had limited commercial experience with its nutraceutical products  which have been manufactured by third parties in limited quantities 
the company currently plans to retain rights to manufacture commercial quantities of pharmaceutical compounds processed using the company s ceform microsphere technology and to conduct other manufacturing operations 
prior to the company s recent acquisition of clonmel  the company had limited experience manufacturing pharmaceutical products for commercial purposes 
the company intends to use clonmel s facilities in ireland for manufacturing activities and is currently taking steps to expand this facility so that it may be used to manufacture products employing the company s proprietary technology 
there can be no assurance that manufacturing and control problems will not arise as the company begins to scale up manufacturing facilities or that manufacturing can be scaled up in a timely manner or at a commercially reasonable cost to enable production in sufficient quantities 
failure by the company to successfully develop commercial scale manufacturing facilities and develop in a timely manner or at a commercially reasonable cost the facilities necessary to manufacture products utilizing the company s technology will have a material adverse effect on the company 
if such manufacturing or control problems arise or if the company is not able to successfully scale up manufacturing in a timely or cost effective manner for any reason  the company s business could be materially adversely affected 
as part of the company s strategy  the company seeks to manufacture products incorporating the company s technologies and has been expanding its manufacturing capabilities 
in the past the company has entered into license agreements that grant the company s collaborative partners the exclusive right to utilize the company s technology to manufacture  or to sublicense the right to manufacture  the pharmaceutical products covered by such license agreements  other than the right to manufacture ceform microspheres which right generally is retained by the company on an exclusive basis 
there can be no assurance that the company s collaborative partners will contract with the company to manufacture licensed products using the company s technology 
failure of the company s collaborative partners to contract with the company for the manufacture of products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
page in connection with the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and food ingredient products  the company will be required to adhere to cgmp regulations enforced by the us food and drug administration fda through its facilities inspection program 
the company also will be required to comply with manufacturing standards prescribed by various federal  state and local regulatory agencies in the united states and other countries 
dependence upon collaborative partners  potential conflicts of interest although the company intends to develop and commercialize certain of its own products  the company also has and anticipates that it will continue to enter into collaborative arrangements with other companies  which will market and manufacture products incorporating the company s technologies 
the company s prospects are  therefore  in part dependent upon the company s ability to attract and retain collaborative partners and to develop products and manufacturing processes that meet the requirements of such collaborative partners 
there can be no assurance that the company s existing or future collaborative arrangements will result in successful product commercialization 
in addition  the company is applying significant resources to company funded development of products for which it later intends to seek collaborative partners 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to enter into collaborative agreements with respect to such company funded projects 
the amount and timing of resources which the parties to collaborative arrangements with the company devote to these activities is not within the control of the company 
if any of the company s collaborators breaches or terminates its agreement with the company or otherwise fails to conduct its collaborative activities in a timely manner  the development or commercialization of the product candidate or research program under such collaborative agreement may be delayed  and the company may be required to devote unforeseen additional resources to such development or commercialization  or terminate such programs 
the termination of collaborative arrangements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that disputes will not arise in the future with respect to the ownership or rights to any technology developed with third parties 
these and other possible disagreements between collaborators and the company could lead to delays in the collaborative research  development or commercialization of certain product candidates  or could require or result in litigation or arbitration  which would be time consuming and expensive and would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company will also be dependent upon the testing  regulatory approval and marketing efforts and  in certain cases  the manufacturing capabilities of its collaborative partners 
the company anticipates that most licensees will be given the exclusive or co exclusive right to market products incorporating the company s technologies for a particular class of products for a particular territory 
the amount and timing of resources to be devoted by the company s collaborators to marketing are not within the control of the company and there can be no assurance that the company s existing collaborative efforts will result in the commercialization of products 
in addition  the company s collaborators may develop  either alone or with others  products that compete with the development and marketing of the company s product candidates 
competing products  either developed by the company s collaborators or to which the collaborators have rights  may result in the company s collaborators withdrawing research  development or marketing support with respect to all or a portion of the company s technology  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
no assurance of product licenses  other risks associated with collaborative agreements the company has entered into development agreements with collaborative partners for products using the company s technologies 
pursuant to these agreements  the company typically has agreed to develop product prototypes for the collaborative partner s evaluation 
a definitive license agreement for the manufacture and marketing of a product or products may be entered into at the same time as the development agreement relating to such product  or at a later date 
in any event  under the company s existing collaborative agreements  collaborative partners generally have the right to abandon a product  and consequently to terminate funding  at any time and for any reason without penalty 
collaborative partners are also generally free to market products using drug delivery or other technologies that are page competitive with those of the company 
a decision by a collaborative partner to delay introduction or abandon one or more of its products incorporating the company s technology or to adopt a competing technology could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s license agreements currently in effect generally provide  and it is expected that future license agreements will provide  for the company to receive a payment at the time of execution of the agreement  additional scheduled payments or payments based on the attainment of certain milestones and royalty payments based on net sales of products by the licensee 
the timing and amount of such payments will fluctuate  and such fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on the company s cash position and results of operations 
in addition  royalty rates for licenses of the company s technologies for otc products are expected  consistent with industry practices  to be lower than royalty rates for licenses relating to prescription products 
limited marketing and sales experience prior to the company s recent acquisitions of pangea  murat  clonmel and istoria  the company had no marketing and sales experience 
to date  the only commercially available product incorporating the company s proprietary technology is a soft chew calcium supplement which is currently being distributed by pangea 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully integrate the sales and marketing resources of its subsidiaries into its current operations 
pangea s sales and marketing system involves independent sales representatives who purchase products from the company 
the company  therefore  has limited control over actual sales activities 
there can be no assurance that pangea or the company s other recently acquired subsidiaries will provide adequate sales and distribution networks for the company s products 
the company may require additional capital and or third party commitments to effectively sell and market the company s products 
risks inherent in international operations on a pro forma basis  giving effect to the company s recent acquisitions of pangea  murat  clonmel and istoria  the company s international operations accounted for of consolidated net revenues for the year ending december  and for the year ended the company has made significant investments in its european subsidiaries and may make additional acquisitions outside the united states 
as such  the company s financial results could be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies affect the dollar value of the company s net investment in foreign subsidiaries  with this fluctuation being included in a separate component of stockholders equity 
operating results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at average monthly exchange rates 
in addition  the us dollar value of transactions based in foreign currency collection on foreign sales or payments for foreign purchases also fluctuates with exchange rates 
at present  the company s largest foreign currency exposure results from activity in irish pounds  french francs and italian lire 
foreign operations may subject the company to the further risks of assimilating differences in foreign business practices  hiring and retaining qualified personnel  overcoming language barriers  limiting asset transfers  changes in foreign regulations and political turmoil 
consumer acceptance of new tablet form rapid dissolving tablets  a significant product application for the company s technology  represent a relatively new drug delivery format that has had limited commercial exposure 
as a consequence  the company s revenues will be dependent upon ultimate consumer acceptance of the company s rapid dissolving tablets as an alternative to conventional oral dosage forms 
in particular  the commercial success of the company s rapid dissolving tablet form will depend on whether consumers will pay more for  or buy more of  a pharmaceutical product marketed in this format and whether this consumer page appeal will make it economical for the company s collaborative partners to license the company s technology or to pursue commercialization of products utilizing this drug delivery format 
competition and technological change the company operates in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving field  and new developments are expected to continue at a rapid pace  especially in the drug delivery market 
competition from large pharmaceutical  nutraceutical  food  consumer product and industrial companies including its collaborators  joint ventures  academic institutions and other public and private research organizations is expected to be intense 
many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and technical resources and production and marketing capabilities than the company and many have substantially greater experience in conducting clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical  nutraceutical  food and other commercial products 
patents and proprietary rights the company s success depends in large part on its ability to obtain patents  maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties 
the company has been granted us patents and has filed a substantial number of applications for additional us patents  as well as corresponding patent applications outside the united states  relating to the company s technologies 
there can be no assurance that any of the pending patent applications will be approved  that the company will develop additional proprietary products that are patentable  that any patents issued to the company will provide the company with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by any third parties or that the patents of others will not prevent the commercialization of products incorporating the company s technologies 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar products  duplicate any of the company s products or  if patents are issued to the company  design around the company s patents 
any of the foregoing actions or results could have a material adverse effect on the company 
government regulation and product approval manufacturing and sales of products and potential products by the company and its collaborative partners may be subject to extensive regulation by the fda and by comparable agencies in foreign countries 
although the nature and extent of regulation varies by type of product  in general  products must meet standards regarding safety and efficacy  manufacturing practices  labeling and purity 
in addition  certain products must receive fda approval prior to marketing 
the fda has extensive enforcement powers  including the power to withhold approvals of new products  to initiate product recalls  to seize products  to delay or prevent product sales and to halt operations 
in addition  governments outside the united states will each have their own set of regulatory standards  and possibly regulatory approvals  with which the company or its collaborators must comply to market products incorporating the company s technologies 
any failure to comply with such standards  or to obtain such approvals  would adversely affect the company 
the company is also subject to numerous environmental and safety laws and regulations 
any violation of  and the cost of compliance with  these regulations could adversely impact the company s operations 
financing requirements and access to capital implementation of the company s business strategy will require significant expenditures of capital 
the company believes that the currently available funds and internally generated cash flow will be sufficient to meet its operating needs through the end of the company s ability to meet its future capital requirements  however  will depend on many factors  including the ability of the company to establish and maintain existing collaborative arrangements and establish and maintain new collaborative arrangements with others  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  complying with regulatory requirements  competing page technological and market developments  changes in the company s existing research relationships  and the effectiveness of product commercialization activities and arrangements 
in addition  if the company elects  or is required by its collaborative partners  to engage in significant commercial scale manufacturing beyond its current plans  to conduct significant marketing activities  or to seek  independent of its collaborative partners  regulatory approvals for its products  the company will require substantial funds for these purposes 
if the company s currently available funds and internally generated cash flow are not sufficient to satisfy its financing needs  the company would be required to seek additional funding through other arrangements with corporate collaborators  through bank borrowings or through public or private sales of its securities  including equity securities 
any such collaboration could result in limitations on the company s ability to control the research  development and commercialization of resulting products  if any  as well as its profits therefrom 
in addition  the terms of any future bank borrowings could place restrictions on the company s ability to take certain actions  and any equity financing could result in dilution to the company s stockholders 
the company does not currently have any committed sources of additional capital 
product liability and insurance the development and sale of products in the pharmaceutical  nutraceutical and food areas involve an inherent risk of product liability claims 
there can be no assurance that product liability claims will not be filed against the company for products sold by others that incorporate the company s technologies or that such companies would not seek indemnification or other relief from the company for any such claims brought against them 
in addition  there can be no assurance that product liability claims will not be filed directly against the company with respect to products manufactured by it 
a product liability claim could have a material adverse effect on the business or financial condition of the company 
the company currently maintains product liability insurance in amounts which it believes are appropriate 
there can be no assurance  however  that product liability insurance will continue to be available to the company in the future on acceptable terms  if at all  or that  if available  the coverages will be adequate to protect the company against future product liability claims
