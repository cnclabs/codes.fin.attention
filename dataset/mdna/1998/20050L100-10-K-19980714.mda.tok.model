item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements 
the following can be interpreted as including forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are typically identified by the words intends  plans  efforts  anticipates  believes  expects  or words of similar import 
various important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements are identified below and may vary significantly based on a number of factors including  but not limited to  availability of labor  marketing success  competitive conditions  and the change in economic conditions of the various markets the company serves 
actual future results may differ materially from those suggested in the following statements 
the company s march   audited financial statements include a qualification regarding the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
as described in the auditor s opinion and at notes  and to the financial statements  the qualification was based on the company s loss and working capital deficit on march   the company s default on certain of its debt covenants  and  as described in notes and to the financial statements  contingencies arising from potential legal actions against the company based on claims for rescission and in connection with the private placement  and the contingencies arising from various litigation  including the shareholder derivative action described below 
the following discussion addresses management s position with respect to the auditor s concerns 
the company s management is in the process of developing a national network of independent security guard companies in order to service clients with sites throughout the united states without incurring the costs of maintaining additional branch offices 
management believes that the implementation of this network will increase its ability to compete against larger national companies and significantly increase its profit margins 
in addition  the company has implemented a plan to actively seek rate increases from its existing clients and to sign new contracts in existing markets in order to realize better economies of scale 
furthermore  management has implemented a centralized purchasing function in order to better control operating costs 
management is in discussions with the company s lenders in order to obtain waivers of loan covenant defaults triggered primarily by the legal action brought by the plaintiffs in the shareholders derivative action to appoint a receiver 
although the company was successful in obtaining a stay of that appointment pending the appeal see the description of the shareholder derivative action below under liquidity and capital resources  management considers such a waiver a remote possibility 
in the event the waivers are not obtained  the company s lenders may call the loans and  in the case of cit  terminate the company s line of credit 
if this occurs  the company would be forced to cease operations and or file for protection under bankruptcy laws 
management cannot predict the liklihood of these events 
expenses to be incurred in connection with the shareholder derivative action cannot be quantified at this time 
the company has no knowledge of any claims for rescission in connection with private placements and believes that the current reserves and insurance is adequate to cover the various litigation matters arising to date as disclosed herein with the exception of the shareholder derivative action 
although the results of these actions are uncertain  the company believes that these steps will help the company improve its operations and generated sufficient cash flow to improve its working capital and satisfy its cash requirements 
at this time  management is unable to reasonably estimate the potential impact on the company s financial condition and the results of operations based on the defaults  legal actions and contingencies

insurance costs increased by approximately  primarily due to higher general liability self insured reserves 
the charges for self insurance reserves are based on actuarial computations and the timing of reported claims and it is  therefore  not known at this time if these increases will continue in future periods 
management expects the trend of increasing pressures on margins to continue primarily due to the intense competition which is characteristic of the industry  and current tight labor markets

the remaining increase is due to the amortization of new customer lists purchased and a non compete covenant 
the provision for doubtful accounts increased by  to  for the fiscal year ended march  compared to  for fiscal year this increase in the provision is management s estimates of accounts that may be uncorrectable  based on continuous monitoring of accounts outstanding in excess of days

management considers such waivers a remote possibility 
at march   the company had borrowed  representing virtually of its maximum borrowing capacity based on the definition of eligible accounts receivable under the terms of the revolving loan agreement 
generally the company borrows a high percentage of its available borrowing  which can fluctuate materially from day to day due to changes in the status of the factors used to determine availability such as billing  payments and aging of accounts receivable 
due primarily to the bankruptcy filing by gfm bayview  a former service agreement client  and increased expenditures due to the start up of a large contract  the company has experienced continued cash overdrafts and a working capital deficit 
this has impacted accounts payable and management is carefully monitoring its relationships with vendors 
the company has been able to reduce its cash overdraft by  since march  and management expects to further decrease the overdraft with future cash flows from operations as well as a significant cash receipt expected in july  in connection with its workers compensation insurance policy 
this receipt  however  will not have any impact on the company s profit or loss

cautionary statement as provided for under the private securities litigation reform act of  the company wishes to caution shareholders and investors that the following important factors  among others  could cause the company s actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the company s forward looking statements in this report 
the company s assumptions regarding projected results depend largely upon the company s ability to retain substantially all of the company s current clients 
retention is affected by several factors including but not limited to the quality of the services provided by the company  the quality and pricing of comparable services offered by competitors  continuity of management and continuity of non management personnel 
there are several major national competitors with resources far greater than those of the company which therefore have the ability to provide service  cost and compensation incentives to clients and employees which could result in the loss of such clients and or employees 
the company s ability to realize its projections will be largely dependent upon its ability to maintain margins  which in turn will be determined in large part by management s control over costs 
to a significant extent  certain costs are not within the control of management and margins may be adversely affected by such items as significant inflation  labor unrest and increased payroll and related costs 
although management currently has no reasonable basis of information upon which to conclude that any significant service company client or security guard customers will default in payment for the services rendered by the company  any such default by a significant client would have a material adverse impact on the company s liquidity  results of operations and financial condition 
additional detailed information concerning a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the information contained herein is readily available in the company s most recent reports on forms k  q and k and its current registration statement on form s and any amendments thereto all as filed with the securities and exchange commission from time to time
