revenues 
revenues for increased to million  reflecting a million increase in the testing products segment and an increase of million in the services segment 
the revenue increases relate to increased unit demand for semiconductors  which translates into increased requirements for products and services supplied by the company 
revenues in the power sources segment declined million in revenues in the asia and pacific and us geographical segments all increased 
the increase in the asia and pacific segment was attributable to a significant increase in demand for services provided by the singapore subsidiary 
the overall increase in the us segment was related to volume increases and product mix changes in the testing products segment 
revenues for increased to million  reflecting a million decrease in the testing products segment and revenue increases of million and million in the services and power sources segments  respectively 
revenues in the testing products segment were million for  which is an increase of over the year

southeast asia economic conditions 
the company has received numerous inquiries concerning the impact of the financial crisis in asia on the future operations of the company 
during the company s singapore subsidiary accounted for approximately of consolidated revenues 
the subsidiary s revenues are denominated in us dollars 
the subsidiary s and the company s principal customers are large multinational semiconductor manufacturers 
the customers sell their products  including drams  into the world semiconductor market 
the average selling price of drams declined as much as in the company s singapore subsidiary provides testing services for drams produced by a multinational semiconductor manufacturer 
the company does not sell directly into the asian market  thus the impact of the asian crisis on the company s revenues should be limited to the indirect impact from the world semiconductor and personal computer markets 
since the company s accounts are denominated in us dollars  the current strength of the us dollar against the singapore dollar will result in a decrease in the converted us dollar amount of those expenses which are denominated in the local currency 
the company anticipates that  during  this forecasted reduction in expenses and competitive factors will result in the singapore company s customer requesting a decrease in unit sales prices ranging from to 
however  higher prices due to product mix changes may offset some or all of the decrease in revenues that result from unit price decreases 
in summary  management does not believe that the economic downturn in southeast asia will have a material adverse impact on the business of the company 
however  actual results could differ materially from current projections 
impact of year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruption of normal business activities 
based on a recent and ongoing assessment  the company has determined that it will be required to modify or replace portions of its software and software that has been sold to customers so that computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the company presently believes that with modifications to existing software or conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems and will not materially affect future financial results 
the company has initiated communications with its significant suppliers and major customers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to any third party s failure to remedy their own year issues 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to modify  or replace  and test software for year compliance 
the company currently anticipates completing the year project within one year  but not later than march   which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
the costs of the project  which at the current time are projected to not be material  and the date on which the company believes it will complete year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could materially differ from those anticipated 
forward looking statements from time to time  the company may publish forward looking statements relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance  business prospects  technological developments  new products  research and development activities and similar matters 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
in order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor  the company notes that a variety of factors could cause the company s actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the company s forward looking statements 
the risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations  performance  development and results of the company s business include  but are not limited to  market acceptance of company products and services  the effects of general economic conditions  the impact of competition  product development schedules  problems with technology  delivery schedules  and supply and demand changes for company products and services and its customers products and services
