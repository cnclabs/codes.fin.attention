item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview osi develops  markets and supports object oriented  client server software systems for managing and supporting services and network operations 
the company was founded in june and began shipments of its netexpert r product line in august as of june   it had directly or indirectly licensed its products to over customers around the world 
revenue from licenses  service and support of the netexpert product line has accounted for substantially all of osi s revenues since inception 
a typical netexpert sale generally includes a combination of license fees  fees for professional services and fees for customer support and training 
osi believes that revenue from the license  service and support of the netexpert product line will continue to account for substantially all of its total revenue for the foreseeable future 
a significant portion of revenues has been  and will continue to be  derived from substantial orders placed by large organizations 
the timing of these orders and their fulfillment has caused and will continue to cause material fluctuations in operating results  particularly on a quarterly basis 
osi believes that its quarterly revenue and operating results are likely to vary significantly in the future  that period to period comparisons of its revenue and results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and that quarterly revenues should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
beginning in the second half of fiscal and continuing through fiscal  osi s customer base and its product and service offerings have been shifting 
its customer base began to reflect an increased percentage of sales to new emerging communications service providers 
these new service providers  often referred to as competitive local exchange carriers clecs  competitive access providers caps and wireless pcs companies  have come into existence after deregulation in the telecommunications markets 
osi s product and service offerings to these new customer segments have also changed 
in particular  new service providers frequently procure a broad suite of network operational support systems using netexpert and netexpert based application components 
many of these customers do not have adequate in house staff to deploy a full suite of osi s netexpert based solutions rapidly 
as a result  the relative proportion of the company s professional services business has increased in comparison to its traditional licensing business 
in addition  product deployment periods have extended  which in turn has resulted in longer customer payment cycles 
during fiscal  the company recognized these changes and adopted a different approach to selling and deploying its products and services 
the effect has been an increase in time between when a customer contract is executed and when osi will recognize revenue 
the company expects that this trend will continue 
osi distributes and sells its netexpert products to end users in north america primarily through a direct sales organization 
outside of north america  it sells through systems integrators  local value added resellers and  to a lesser extent  through an in region direct sales force 
osi intends to enter into additional international markets and to continue to grow its international operations by expanding its direct sales force  opening new in region customer support and sales offices  adding value added resellers and pursuing additional strategic relationships

in  total revenues grew compared to as a result of increased sales to new and existing customers  coupled with an overall increase in services 
the increase in service revenue was mainly a reflection of the greater continuing percentage of sales that were made to new emerging service providers  who typically require a higher level of professional services to implement new solutions 
in addition to an increase in professional services  support revenues increased in as a result of a larger installed base of netexpert products and an increase in customer demand driven by year initiatives 
total revenues decreased in compared to this decrease in total revenue is mainly attributable to large orders not closing within the period and osi s shift in focus to the new emerging service providers  who generally require longer sales cycles and represent greater credit risks 
list prices for osi s products and services did not change significantly during the comparison periods 
license revenues 
software licenses are generally granted and priced on a per server basis  although osi may grant site  network wide or enterprise wide licenses for larger installations 
license revenues are generally recognized when a non cancelable license agreement has been signed  product has been shipped  there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the fees are fixed and determinable  and collection is probable 
revenue and profits under contracts requiring significant customization are recognized using the percentage of completion method of contract accounting based on the ratio of incurred costs to total estimated costs 
although osi s license agreements generally do not provide for a right of return  reserves are maintained for returns and potential credit losses 
in and  osi charged approximately million and million respectively  to its reserve for sales returns 
this was done to reflect perceived risks associated with actual and potential customer returns 
additions to the reserve for sales returns in were not significant 
license revenues increased in compared with this was mainly a function of increased sales and the completion of network deployment cycles 
license revenues decreased in compared with this was due mainly to the factors discussed above regarding total revenues 
the consistent decrease in license revenues as a percentage of total revenues from to and to also strongly reflects the shift in sales to new emerging service providers 
in addition  the company experienced an increase in the number of orders for its pre built application rule sets  which generally require a higher level of installation services than does the netexpert framework 
osi anticipates that license revenues will continue to represent a majority of its total revenues for the foreseeable future 
however  it also believes that historic growth rates of its license revenues should not be relied upon as an indication of growth rates for future periods 
in addition  it believes that competition in its markets is increasing  which could result in price reductions  reduced gross margins or loss of market share  any of which would have a material adverse effect on its business  operating results and financial condition 
services and other revenues 
revenues for training  consulting and professional services are recognized as the services are performed and acceptance criteria have been met 
osi offers month support contracts to its customers 
these contracts provide a customer with telephone support  updates and maintenance of netexpert framework during the support period 
maintenance revenues from support contracts are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the support agreement 
payments for support fees are generally made in advance and are nonrefundable 
the growth in services and other revenues in absolute dollars for each period reflects the higher demand for osi s professional services  including requirements analysis  project management and system design  customization and installation  in connection with the increased number of netexpert licenses 
to a lesser extent it also reflects an incremental increase in support and training revenues based on a larger installed base of netexpert 
the increase in services and other revenues as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal and fiscal are mainly a function of increased revenues derived from new and emerging service providers 
as noted above in the overview  the nature of the solutions purchased by these customers as well as their lack of sufficient staff to implement those solutions internally often leads them to rely more heavily on osi s professional services 
osi expects that services and other revenues will continue to represent a significant portion of its total revenues in future periods  mainly due to a continued demand for professional services in connection with licenses of netexpert  renewal of existing support contracts and incremental support revenues attributable to a growing installed base of netexpert 
the company also believes that prior growth rates for its services and other revenues may not be sustainable and should not be relied on as an indication of growth rates in the future 
international revenues 
revenues from outside of the united states represented  and of total revenues for  and  respectively 
revenues from customers in asia and the pacific rim accounted for of total revenues in compared with in fiscal and in fiscal the company does not believe that the weakened economy in this region has had an immediate effect on its revenues in absolute dollars 
however  there are clear macro and micro indications that this may not be the case in future periods 
over the reporting period  the company did not experience the same growth rate in its asia pacific region that it did in its other regions 
the result was an overall decrease in asia pacific revenues as a percentage of total revenues 
there can be no assurances that the economies in asia pacific will recover in the near term or that similar economic problems will not occur in other parts of the world 
sales to european customers accounted for of total revenues in compared with in and in sales into eastern european countries have not been significant 
osi expects that international revenues will continue to account for a material portion of its total revenues in future periods 
it intends to enter additional international markets and continue expanding its existing international operations 
the company s international business involves a number of inherent risks  including longer receivable collection periods  greater difficulty in collections  fluctuations in the real cost of its products given relative exchange rate changes  difficulty in staffing and managing operations  a longer sales cycle  potentially unstable political and economic conditions  language barriers  cultural differences  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  including a slowdown in the rate of privatization of telecommunications services providers  reduced protection for intellectual property rights  potentially adverse tax consequences  and tariffs and other trade barriers 
in addition  access to foreign markets is often difficult due to the established relationships between government owned or controlled communications companies and local suppliers of communications products 
osi cannot give any assurances that it will be able to continue penetrating international markets successfully 
in addition  osi cannot give any assurances that it will be able to sustain or increase revenue from international licensing and services or that the factors listed above will not adversely affect the company s future international business 
any of these factors could have a material  adverse effect on the company  its overall business  operating results and financial condition

cost of license revenues consists primarily of license fees paid to third party software vendors and the costs of product media and duplication  manuals  packaging materials  shipping expenses  amortization of capitalized software costs and related labor costs 
in absolute dollars  the cost of license revenues increased in each of  and the increase in was mainly due to the increased volume of the company s business  which yielded increased costs for third party products and technology embedded in the company s products 
the increase in can primarily be attributed to increased production costs 
in  the cost of license revenues as a percentage of total revenues remained basically flat compared with gross profit from license revenues was  and in  and  respectively 
the company believes that this decline  while minor  can be attributed to increased costs for license fees paid for third party software 
the company expects to continue licensing third party software and expects these costs are likely to increase in absolute dollars 
cost of services and other revenues 
cost of services and other revenues consists primarily of personnel costs related to providing professional services and maintenance services in connection with licensing of the company s products 
it also includes outside service fees paid to third party providers of professional services  related travel costs  overhead and estimated losses related to professional services contracts 
total professional services costs were flat in compared with in  osi spent million in contractor costs compared to million in in million was accrued for estimated losses on professional services contracts without a similar expense in however  these savings were offset by the addition of internal headcount over the course of the year 
accordingly  the overall result was a slight increase in cost of services and other revenues 
osi expects that these costs may continue to increase in absolute dollars 
costs increases in compared to were mainly due to increases in salaries and related expenses related to growth in head count as osi built its professional service and customer support organizations 
gross profit loss percentages from service and other revenues were  and in  and  respectively 
in  accrued loss contracts were primarily responsible for the decrease in gross profit compared with osi expects to maintain a gross profit in services  however  costs may increase and there could be losses in the future

sales and marketing expenses consist mainly of salaries  commissions and bonuses for sales and marketing personnel  facilities costs associated with osi s sales and customer support offices  promotional expenses and contract administration 
the absolute increase in sales and marketing expenses during was caused mainly by a higher average headcount and higher commission expenses resulting from increased revenues 
during this period  there was also expense growth in product marketing  travel  communications and facilities 
osi has entered into marketing agreements with various other companies regarding the marketing and distribution of its products 
these agreements may result in significant commissions being paid  in addition to osi s ongoing selling costs 
osi expects that sales and marketing expenses in future periods may continue to increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of total revenues 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses in when compared with was mainly the result of expanding osi s sales and marketing organizations particularly outside of north america  increased facility costs related to that expansion  and increased expenses for trade shows  advertising and other marketing programs 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues in when compared with resulted from the absolute increase in those expenses coupled with the decrease in revenues over the same period 
research and development 
in  the increase in research and development expenses over those in resulted mainly from increases in the average headcount  salary levels and associated equipment  facilities and support for technical personnel 
the increase in research and development expenses the previous fiscal year can be attributed to the same factors 
personnel headcount increased approximately during  during and approximately in in  the company began to increase its research and development resources and has continued to do so over this past year 
osi anticipates that it will continue to commit significant resources to research and development in future periods to enhance and extend its core technology and product lines 
osi also expects that research and development expenses in the future periods will continue to increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of total revenues 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist mainly of personnel costs for finance  human resources  legal affairs and general management 
also included are outside legal and accounting fees  corporate insurance expenses  provision for bad debts and in  a million management restructuring charge 
general and administrative expenses decreased in  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of total revenues 
this decrease was due primarily to a decrease in bad debt expense 
osi recorded bad debt expenses of  in compared with million in in addition  there was a reduction in employee relocation expenses in to  compared with  in the increase in general and administrative expenses in when compared with primarily resulted from increased provisions for bad debts and increased costs for additional executive management personnel 
also included in these figures is a million management restructuring charge following the resignation of osi s then president and chief executive officer and the termination of certain other employees 
outside administrative service fees  and insurance expenses increased in over as a result of expanded operations 
general and administrative expenses may increase in the future with continued growth of osi and the hiring of additional executive personnel 
although osi believes its allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate at the end of  it will continue to review this allowance and adjust it as needed 
this may result in additional charges to general and administrative expenses 
osi has recorded deferred compensation expense for certain stock options that have been granted since february the amortization of deferred compensation expense is allocated among sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses 
the amortization resulted in a charge to operations of   and  for  and  respectively

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
factors that may affect future results osi s quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and can be expected to vary significantly in the future 
the fluctuation in quarterly license revenues is caused by the timing of large orders by the company s customers  including global telecommunication providers and the new emerging communication service providers as described more fully in the overview section 
large orders are typically preceded by long sales cycles and accordingly  it has been and will continue to be difficult to predict when these orders will be received 
osi expects that quarterly license revenues will continue to vary significantly depending on the timing of large orders 
the failure to obtain a large order during any given reporting period  for whatever reason  would have a material adverse effect on osi s business 
in addition  osi typically receives a significant portion of its orders and records the resulting revenue in the last month of a quarter  frequently in the last weeks or even days of a quarter 
osi s expense levels are based  in part  on expectations as to future revenues 
if actual revenues are below expectations  operating results can be adversely affected 
in particular  because only a small portion of its expenses varies with revenue  net income may be disproportionately affected by a decrease from anticipated revenue 
osi believes this pattern will continue 
osi s quarterly operating results have also varied and will vary significantly based on factors such as the capital spending patterns of its customers  changes in pricing policies by osi or its competitors  increased competition  cancellation of licenses or support agreements  changes in operating expenses  personnel changes  fluctuation in demand for netexpert products  the number  timing and significance of new products and product enhancements by osi and its competitors  the ability of osi to develop  introduce and market new and enhanced versions of netexpert products on a timely basis  the mix of direct and indirect sales  osi s assessment of its allowance for bad debts  sales returns  and general economic factors  among others 
due to these factors  quarterly revenue and operating results have been and will continue to be difficult to forecast 
revenues are also difficult to forecast because osi s sales cycle  from initial evaluation to product installation  varies substantially from customer to customer 
the purchase of a network operations support and management application generally involves a significant commitment of capital  with the attendant time requirements often associated with a customer s internal approval procedures 
it also involves the need to test and accept new technologies that affect crucial operations 
for these and other reasons  the sales cycle for osi s products is typically lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks over which osi has little or no control 
see further discussion of the shift of osi s customer base in the overview section 
the company s future success depends  to a significant degree  on the continuing contributions of its key management  sales  professional services  customer support and product development personnel 
the loss of  or the inability to attract and retain  key personnel could adversely affect the company 
osi has experienced and continues to experience difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel 
there is intense competition for qualified employees in the software industry  and there can be no assurance that osi will be successful in attracting and retaining the people that it needs 
the complex nature of its customers networks requires that osi recruit and hire personnel with expertise in  and a broad understanding of  telecommunications and other industries 
there are only a limited number of qualified personnel available for employment 
failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business condition 
to compete effectively and manage future growth  osi also needs to continuously improve its internal operational  financial and management information systems  procedures and controls in a timely manner to accommodate higher numbers of transactions and customers 
management of future growth also means that the company must expand  train  motivate and manage its workforce 
there can be no assurance that osi s personnel  systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support its existing and future operations 
the failure to improve operational  financial and management systems  or to expand  train  motivate and manage employees  could have a material adverse effect on osi s financial business 
in addition  software products as complex as those offered by osi are likely to contain defects when they are introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released 
although osi is not aware of any material software defects in its products  there can be no assurances  despite extensive testing by osi and its customers  that errors will not be found after commercial licensing begins 
this could result in delayed or lost revenue  loss of market share or failure to achieve market acceptance 
any of these could have a material adverse effect on osi s business 
osi has an ongoing program of assessing the extent to which its internal systems and products evaluate date information  and  if so  whether they can properly process and evaluate dates on or after the year whether they are year compliant 
the company is taking remedial action where its systems and products are not year compliant 
the company is also evaluating contingency plans for continuing operations if year problems arise despite its steps to avoid them 
the company expects these activities to continue throughout fiscal the company believes that it has identified the year dependencies in its internal systems 
it has examined all critical systems including manufacturing  sales  development  communications and financial systems 
it has also examined many of its non computer electronic devices which contain microprocessors for example  telephones and security systems 
as these dependencies have been identified  osi believes that it is taking the remediation measures necessary for its internal systems to be year compliant 
osi is not currently aware of any material operational issues or costs associated with preparing its internal systems for the year however  no assurances can be given that osi will not experience unanticipated material costs caused by undetected errors or defects in its internal systems 
delays in implementation of new information systems or a failure to identify all of its year dependencies could result in material adverse consequences 
osi has also been taking measures to bring its products into year compliance in a timely way 
at this time  a year compliant version of the netexpert framework is available and has been successfully tested on a number of operating systems platforms for year compliance using british standards institutions criteria 
the changes needed to make other netexpert products compliant are currently either completed or are being coded and tested 
the company expects these efforts to be completed by the end of this calender year 
however  the company can give no assurances that its efforts will be successful or that its compliant products will function properly when they are integrated with other non compliant products  including third party software and hardware 
if osi s products are not able to manage and manipulate data related to the year  the result could be a material adverse affect on its business 
osi has incurred and will incur various costs to conduct testing and modification of its products and for those systems  products and deliverables including customized osi software for which customers are responsible and to provide customer support services regarding year issues 
it also anticipates that these costs will continue in fiscal year and thereafter 
the company has contacted each of its customers and provided them with information regarding the year compliance of osi s products and offered them professional services to assist with migrating their netexpert based systems to year compliant versions 
additionally  the company has made information available to its customers on its technical assistance website 
osi is also working with the key suppliers of products and services used in connection with netexpert to determine whether their products and services are year compliant 
it is also attempting to monitor their progress toward year capability and compatibility with year compliant versions of netexpert 
the company expects these efforts to be completed by the end of this calendar year 
the company s products used in numerous operating environments 
even if the company brings its principle products into year compliance  its customers may nevertheless experience year difficulties due to noncompliance of third party products with which the company s products interoperate 
even if the company identifies and notifies its customers of these third party software issues  customers may bring litigation against the makers of all of the component parts of an operating environment 
osi s agreements with its customers typically contain provisions designed to limit its liability for these types of claims 
it is possible  however  that this will not provide adequate protection from liability under existing or future federal  state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions 
any such claims  whether with or without merit  could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
to date  the company has incurred costs related to its year readiness program 
in  these costs are estimated to be approximately million 
the company will incur additional costs related to the year readiness program related to product testing and customer service requests 
these costs are currently not expected to exceed million over the next fiscal year 
the predominant portion of the costs incurred to date  as well as those expected to be incurred  are research and development expenses related to the modification and testing of the company s products 
this estimate does not include potential costs related to customer or other claims  or costs related to internal software and hardware replaced in the normal course of business 
this estimate is based on a current assessment and is subject to change as the company s year readiness program progresses 
osi currently expects that the year issue will not pose significant internal  operational problems 
however  a delay in implementing new information systems  or a failure to fully identify all year dependencies in the company s internal systems or in the systems of its suppliers  customers and financial institutions could have material adverse consequences  including delays in the delivery or sale of products 
therefore  the company is developing contingency plans for continuing operations should these types of problems arise 
the company believes that its contingency planning will be completed and tested by the end of the calendar year 
osi believes that the purchasing patterns of its customers and potential customers may also be affected by the year issues as they expend significant resources to bring their current software systems into year compliance 
these expenditures could result in reduced funds available to purchase products such as those offered by the company 
this could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
osi s products are designed for use in an evolving network operations support and management applications market 
competition in this market is intense and is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and rapid changes in customer requirements 
osi s competitors offer a variety of solutions to address this market 
the company believes competition in its markets is likely to increase 
most of osi s customers continuously evaluate whether to design and develop their own network operations support and management applications or purchase them from outside vendors 
accordingly  osi must continuously educate customers about the advantages of osi s products compared to internally developed network applications and competitors products 
there can be no assurance that osi s current or potential competitors will not develop products comparable or superior to those developed by osi or adapt more quickly than osi to new technologies  evolving industry trends or changing customer requirements 
if osi is unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors  osi s business will be materially and adversely affected 
osi expects that international license  service and other revenues outside the united states will continue to account for a significant portion of its total revenues in future periods 
the company intends to enter into additional international markets and continue to expand its operations outside of north america 
this expansion will require significant management attention and the expenditure of significant financial resources 
the result could adversely affect osi s operating margins 
historically  the company s transactions have been primarily in us dollars 
however  as the company expands its operations and establishes more sales offices outside of the united states  transactions in non us currencies are likely to increase 
this would result in a corresponding increase in the company s exchange rate risk 
if exchange rates change unfavorably  this could result in charges to operations 
although osi has attempted to reduce the risk of fluctuations in exchange rates by pricing its products and services in u 
s 
dollars  it pays its expenses in local currencies and does not engage in hedging transactions with respect to those obligations 
currency exchange fluctuations in countries in which osi licenses its products could have a materially adverse effect on the company s business by making its pricing non competitive with products priced in local currencies 
a key element of osi s future business strategy is to develop relationships with leading companies that manufacture and market telecommunications equipment and to expand its system integrator and value added reseller channels of distribution 
osi is currently investing and plans to continue investing significant resources to develop these relationships and channels of distribution 
there can be no assurance osi will be able to attract additional systems integrators and resellers that can market osi s product effectively 
if osi is unable to develop these relationships and market its products effectively  osi s business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
osi s success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon its proprietary software technology 
the company relies on a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and various technical measures to protect its proprietary rights 
despite osi s efforts  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy osi s products or to obtain and use osi s proprietary information 
there can be no assurances that the steps taken by osi will prevent misappropriation of its technology 
these precautions may not preclude competitors from developing products with functionality or features similar to osi s products 
in addition  effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
while osi believes that its products and trademarks do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurances that in the future there will not be infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the industry increases 
any such claim  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and divert technical and management personnel 
this could result in a material adverse impact on the company s business 
finally  osi relies on software that it licenses from third parties  including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in osi s products to perform key functions 
there can be no assurances that these third party software licenses will continue to be available to osi on commercially reasonable terms 
absence of these licenses could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
based upon all of the above  osi s quarterly revenues and operating results are likely to vary significantly in the future 
osi also believes that period to period comparisons of its results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied on as indications of future performance 
further  it is likely that in some future quarter osi s revenue or operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if that occurs  the price of osi s common stock could be materially  adversely affected 
liquidity and capital resources in  osi experienced a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of million  compared with a net decrease of million in and a net increase of million in the increase in was mainly caused by positive net cash from investing activities of million  generated principally by sales of short term investments  and financing activities of million  generated mainly by the issuance of common stock 
net cash used for operating activities was made up mainly of a million net loss plus an adjustment of million to reflect deferred income taxes 
these were partially offset by depreciation and amortization of million and decreases in accounts receivables of million 
the result was net cash used for operations of million 
the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents was driven largely by million in short term investments  million in purchases of property and equipment to support its growing operations and the purchase of assets from the company s australian distributor 
the large increase in cash and cash equivalents in derived mainly from the company s public offering and occurred despite an increase in amounts receivable of approximately million 
as of june   osi had working capital of approximately million  including million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
in addition  the company has a million unsecured revolving line of credit 
under that line of credit  which expires in december  borrowings bear interest at either a fluctuating rate per year equal to the prime lending rate in effect  or a fixed rate per year that is equal to above the london inter bank offered rate 
as of june   no amounts had been borrowed under the line of credit 
the agreement for the line of credit has certain financial covenants and  as of june   osi was in compliance with those provisions 
some of the company s accounts receivable are beyond their payment terms 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts that is believed to be adequate to cover potential credit losses 
in  the allowance for doubtful accounts increased by approximately million to reflect increased exposure on certain accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was increased in by approximately million 
on june   the company s reserves for bad debt and sales returns were million 
osi believes the current reserves are adequate to provide for potential credit losses or sales returns 
osi currently has material commitments of approximately million for tenant improvements in its new facilities 
additionally  management intends to continue to support the growth of osi s operations 
in  osi spent million for capital items  principally computer hardware and software and communications equipment 
capital expenditures are likely to continue being significant in and in the future 
osi believes that its cash balances and its cash flow from operations are sufficient to support its working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
thereafter  if cash generated from operations cannot satisfy its working capital requirement  osi may need to raise additional funds 
that financing may not be available or  if it is  it may not be obtainable on terms that are favorable to osi or its stockholders 
if osi raises additional capital by issuing equity or convertible debt securities  ownership dilution to stockholders will result 
if funds are unavailable  osi s business may be adversely affected 
in september  the company s board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program pursuant to which the company could purchase up to  shares of its common stock on the open market 
as of september  the company had repurchased and retired approximately  shares of its common stock in the open market at an average purchase price of for a total cost of  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the rate of return on its investments and international currency fluctuations 
in the normal course of business  the company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency values 
the company s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its investment portfolio 
the company has not used derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
it invests with high quality issuers and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company protects and preserves its invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
the net assets of the company s australian subsidiary are denominated in australian dollars 
the company operates in certain countries in latin america  eastern europe and asia pacific where there are limited forward currency exchange markets 
the company has unhedged transaction exposures in these currencies 
the company has not entered into forward foreign exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes
