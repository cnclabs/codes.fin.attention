net interest income for increased as compared to  rising from million in to million in noninterest income increased from million in to million in while noninterest expense increased from million in to million in see separate discussions of noninterest income and noninterest expense below 
return on average assets decreased from in to in  including the extraordinary item  and return on average equity decreased from in to in net interest income during the third quarter of the corporation began recording certain loan fees as noninterest revenue which  until then  were classified as interest income 
as a result  net interest income for ended marginally higher at million  up from the corporation s net interest margin declined from at the end of to at the end of  also a reflection of the change in classification of certain loan related fee income 
the corporation s average earning assets increased from billion in to billion in average interest bearing liabilities also increased during the period  from billion in to billion in average interest bearing liabilities as a percentage of average earning assets remained fairly stable  moving from in to in the taxable equivalent yield on average interest earning assets increased from in to in the cost of average interest bearing liabilities likewise increased from to during the same period 
the yield on interest bearing assets has been favorably impacted due to the corporation s increase in consumer loans  which traditionally experience higher yields than other loans 
loans accounted for of total assets as of december  compared to as of december  approximately million of indirect automobile loans were sold in  which affected the corporation s ending loan balance for the servicing rights were retained on these sold loans  and the resulting cash generated from this loan sale was used for funding of new loans 
the corporation invested in several new branches during  generating new loan and deposit growth 
the interest costs associated with opening new branches is generally higher than normal  in order to gain market share 
this factor  along with the traditional market pressures from competitors  increased the corporation s cost of interest bearing liabilities from million in to million in provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses increased from million in to million in the majority of this increase was directly related to the corporation s investment in indirect consumer loans  which generally experience higher yields and higher charge offs than other loans 
in addition  the provision will increase during the normal course of business as the respective loan portfolio balance increases  in order to maintain the proper percentage of loan loss allowance to total loans 
charge offs  net of recoveries  as a percentage of average loans outstanding increased from in to in as gross charge offs and recoveries both increased for in line with the increase in average loans outstanding as compared to the allowance for loan losses increased significantly  rising from million at december  to million at december  the corporation does not believe there are currently any trends  events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the volume of its non performing loans 
noninterest income noninterest income increased from million in to million in service charges on deposit related products generated million for the year  an increase of thousand over the previous year 
trust income increased from million in to million in as the trust assets under management increased during the year 
gains on sale of residential mortgage loans decreased from million in to million in  due to a lower volume of loan sales 
other noninterest income increased from million in to million in  largely due to the reclassification of loan related fees from interest income  and also due to an operating gain of million on the sale of the corporation s subsidiary  commercial bank  west liberty  which was completed in july securities gains and losses were not a significant factor in either or  as the corporation incurred net securities gains of  in and  in noninterest expense noninterest expense increased from million in to million in salaries and employee benefits increased marginally from million in to million in occupancy expense likewise increased from million in to million in and equipment costs grew from million in to million in data processing costs increased from million in to million in and stationery  printing and office supplies marginally increased from million in to million in marketing and advertising increased from million in to million in while legal and professional fees increased from million in to million in repossession expense increased from million in to million in meetings and training increased to million in from million in telephone expense increased from million in to million in compared to net income for was million compared to million for basic earnings per share for was per share compared to for net interest income grew from million in to million in the increase in net interest income was due to a higher level of average earning assets and rising interest rates during the yield on interest earning assets increased and the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased during as compared to the taxable equivalent yield on average interest earning assets increased from in to in the cost of average interest bearing liabilities decreased from to during the same period 
as a result of this the net interest margin increased from in to in noninterest income increased from million in to million in service charges on deposit accounts  the largest component  increased from million in to million in during the same period  other noninterest income increased from million to million and trust income increased from million to million 
net gains from the sale of residential mortgage loans increased from thousand in to million in  due to a larger volume of loans sold 
securities gains and losses were minimal in both periods  as the corporation incurred net securities gains of thousand in and thousand in noninterest expense decreased from million in to million in a cost containment program implemented during successfully reduced many noninterest expenses

disclosures regarding year many companies have undertaken major projects to address year readiness  which relates to the recognition of dates beyond many software programs and hardware systems are in a two digit format which will not process into the next century 
the corporation has already taken steps necessary to ensure that the corporation will be year compliant 
those steps include the following assessment of the significant issues throughout the organization and customer base  in order to be prepared for proper processing of information 
implementation of a steering committee and project team to oversee the successful attainment of year compliance 
completion of an inventory of all hardware  software  systems  and facilities to identify products which must be replaced  retired  or renovated 
contacting all respective third party providers of computer related services and have requested that they provide evidence to the corporation by june of their intention to be year compliant 
creation of a test environment to validate software  hardware  and systems as new releases become available 
the corporation s board of directors and executive management have committed to providing the appropriate resources and workforce necessary to ensure compliance with year management anticipates that all internal hardware upgrades or replacements will be completed by march the costs associated with hardware and software upgrades will be approximately  in and  in management believes that these estimates are generous and that these costs are not material to the financial condition of the corporation 
the corporation s most significant exposure will be relying upon third party vendors and processors and managing the relationship with their product or service as the corporation tests their year ready products and services 
the corporation s primary third party data processor  one of the country s leading suppliers of financial institution data processing services  has already provided assurances that it will be year compliant prior to mid year as testing occurs throughout  any vendors who cannot certify their intentions to be year compliant will be abandoned and new vendors will be contacted 
the corporation anticipates completing year issues by the middle of liquidity the corporation s objectives are to ensure that funds are available at the subsidiary banks to meet deposit withdrawals and credit demands without unduly penalizing profitability  and to ensure that funding is available for the parent corporation to meet the ongoing cash needs while maximizing profitability 
the corporation continues to identify ways to provide for liquidity on both a current and long term basis 
on a long term basis  the market regions rely mainly on core deposits  certificates of deposit of  or more  repayment of principal and interest on loans and securities  as well as federal funds sold and purchased 
the market regions also rely on the sale of securities under repurchase agreements  securities available for sale and federal home loan bank borrowings 
deposits decreased marginally from billion at december  to billion at december  the sale of commercial bank  west liberty in july  reduced the corporation s deposits by approximately million 
by adjusting for this sale  the corporation s deposits increased by slightly over from the previous year 
since loan demand outpaced deposit growth  the corporation increased its borrowings of federal funds  federal home loan bank borrowings  and other short term borrowings 
the corporation s largest subsidiary  community trust bank  na  also completed the securitization and sale of approximately million of its auto loans during the second quarter of to provide additional funding 
during april the corporation raised million of cash through the issuance of cumulative trust preferred securities 
these cash proceeds were applied to the corporation s liquidity position to fund new loans  new branches  and for future acquisitions 
these securities will mature in march  due to the nature of the markets served by the banking regions  management believes that the majority of its certificates of deposit of  or more are no more volatile than its core deposits 
during the periods of low interest rates  these deposit balances remained stable as a percentage of total deposits 
in addition  the corporation is able to borrow funds with several correspondent banks  to meet the corporation s liquidity needs 
the corporation owns million of securities designated as available for sale and valued at market which are available to meet liquidity needs on a continuing basis 
the corporation also relies on federal home loan bank advances for both liquidity and management of its asset liability position 
federal home loan bank advances decreased from million at december  to million at december  the corporation generally relies upon net inflows of cash from financing activities  supplemented by net inflows of cash from operating activities  to provide cash for its investing activities 
as is typical of many financial institutions  significant financing activities include deposit gathering  use of short term borrowing facilities such as federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements  and the issuance of long term debt 
the corporation has a million credit line available beyond  in the form of a revolving line of credit see note long term debt 
the corporation s primary investing activities include purchases of investment securities and loan originations 
in conjunction with maintaining a satisfactory level of liquidity  management monitors the degree of interest rate risk assumed on the balance sheet 
the corporation monitors its interest rate risk by the use of static and dynamic gap models at the one year interval 
the static gap model monitors the difference in interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities as a percentage of total assets that mature within the specified time frame 
the dynamic gap model goes further in that it assumes that interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will be reinvested 
the corporation uses the sendero system to monitor its interest rate risk 
the corporation desires an interest sensitivity gap of not more than fifteen percent of total assets at the one year interval 
the corporation s static interest rate gap position as of december  is presented below interest rate sensitivity analysis december  total over in thousands months months year year total interest earning assets securities and deposits      loans      total earning assets      interest bearing liabilities now  money market and savings accounts     time deposits      federal funds purchased and other short term borrowings     advances from fhlb      long term debt     total interest bearing liabilities      interest sensitivity gap for the period      cumulative      cumulative as a percent of earning assets capital resources total shareholders equity increased from million at december  to million at december  the corporation s primary source of capital is retained earnings 
cash dividends were per share for and per share for regulatory guidelines require bank holding companies  commercial banks  and savings banks to maintain certain minimum ratios and define companies as well capitalized that sufficiently exceed the minimum ratios 
the banking regulators may alter minimum capital requirements as a result of revising their internal policies and their ratings of individual institutions 
to be well capitalized banks and bank holding companies must maintiain a tier leverage ratio of no less than  a tier risk based ratio of no less than and a total risk based ratio of no less than 
the corporation s ratios as of december  were  and  respectively 
the corporation and all of its banking affiliates met the criteria for well capitalized at december  as of december   management is not aware of any current recommendations by banking regulatory authorities which  if they were to be implemented  would have  or are reasonably likely to have  a material adverse impact on the corporation s liquidity  capital resources  or operations 
impact of inflation and changing prices the majority of the corporation s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
therefore  the corporation differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in nonmonetary assets  such as fixed assets and inventories 
however  inflation does have an important impact on the growth of assets in the banking industry and on the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation also affects other expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
management believes the most significant impact on financial and operating results is the corporation s ability to react to changes in interest rates 
management seeks to maintain an essentially balanced position between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against the effects of wide interest rate fluctuations 
at december   the results of the corporation s interest sensitivity analysis indicated that net interest income would be relatively unchanged by a basis point increase or decrease in the federal funds rate assuming the change occurs evenly over the next year and that corresponding changes in other market rates occur as forecasted 
net interest income would be expected to increase if rates increased basis points and would be expected to decrease if rates declined basis points
