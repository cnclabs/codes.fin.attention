background brazilian political environment the brazilian political environment has been marked by high levels of uncertainty since the country returned to civilian rule in after years of military government 
the death of a president in and the resignation of another president in the midst of impeachment proceedings in  as well as rapid turnover at and immediately below the cabinet level  have adversely affected the implementation of consistent economic and monetary policies  including consistent policies in the areas of government owned enterprises and telecommunications 
measures by the government intended to influence the course of brazil s economy eg actions to control inflation  interest rates or consumption have been frequent and occasionally drastic 
changes in policy  social instability or other political or economic developments  and the brazilian government s responses to such developments  may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
mr 
fernando henrique cardoso was elected president of brazil in october and took office in january for a single four year term 
he has generally sought to continue the economic stabilization and liberalization policies he developed as finance minister from may through april under president itamar franco 
president cardoso is the leader of a coalition of political parties that represents a majority of the federal congress and his party controls the state governments of the states of sao paulo  rio de janeiro and minas gerais 
brazil s constitution was recently amended to permit president cardoso to stand for re election to a second four year term 
president cardoso s policies appear to have broad political support and his re election seems likely although not assured 
there can be no assurance that such policies will not be revised in whole or in part at some future date 
furthermore  some important groups remain opposed to significant elements of his program  and the implementation of any policies of economic stabilization or liberalization is subject to significant compromises and accommodations 
economic environment the financial condition and results of operations of the company are dependent on general economic conditions in brazil  and in particular on i economic growth and its impact on demand for fast food services and ii exchange rates between brazilian and foreign currencies 
historically  the brazilian economy has been extremely volatile  and the government has implemented a succession of programs intended to stabilize the economy and provide a basis for sustainable  non inflationary growth 
venbo has been affected by such programs in a variety of ways  particularly when such programs have resulted in contractions in demand or very high real interest rates 
beginning in december  the government introduced the real plan  an economic stabilization program intended to reduce the rate of inflation by reducing certain public expenditures  collecting liabilities owed to the government  increasing tax revenues  continuing to privatize government owned entities and introducing a new currency 
the real was introduced as brazil s currency in july  based on a monetary correction index  the urv  introduced earlier in the year 
since taking office in january  president cardoso has continued to implement the real plan 
under the real plan  the rate of inflation has decreased significantly  and the rate of growth of real gross domestic product has increased substantially 
the long term effects of the real plan upon the brazilian economy in general or upon the company in particular are uncertain 
notwithstanding the success of the real plan to date  there can be no assurance that it will continue in effect or continue to be successful 
effects of inflation and devaluation brazil has experienced extremely high and generally unpredictable rates of inflation and of devaluation of brazilian currency for many years 
since the introduction of the real plan in july  the rate of inflation has decreased considerably 
as measured through by the unidade fiscal de referencia the ufir and by the indice geral de precos mercado the igp m thereafter  the annualized rate of inflation was  for the first six months of  for the last six months of and for the year  with significantly all of s inflation occurring during the first six months of that year 
the annual rate of inflation during was as compared to in despite this reduction  the rate of inflation remains high compared to other countries  and the potential for distortions or dislocations attributable to changing prices continues to exist 
the exchange rate between the real and the us dollar has also been relatively stable since early july  compared to prior periods  although the potential for devaluation or volatility persists 
the following table sets forth brazilian inflation  as measured by the ufir igp m  and the devaluation of the brazilian currency against the us dollar for the periods shown

annualized rates see selected historical financial data exchange rates 
the company s results of operations in have been affected by inflation  and such financial information should be evaluated in light of the methodology for recognition of the effects of inflation 
see selected financial data 
significant effects include the following effects of purchasing power gains and losses on revenues 
inflation produces purchasing power losses on accounts receivable between the date of service and the date of payment by the customer 
these losses are partly offset by purchasing power gains on accounts payable and accrued expenses  value added taxes and other taxes on operating revenues between the date of accrual and the date of payment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
effects of inflation on financial instruments denominated in brazilian currency 
the company has both assets and liabilities that are financial instruments denominated in brazilian currency 
until july   the indexation of principal was provided for according to the index specified in the relevant instrument subsequent to that time  only interest was impacted by indexation 
as of july   the company s management determined that brazil no longer had a hyperinflationary economy as defined in sfas and ceased indexing the company s consolidated financial statements for constant currency purchasing power 
in the consolidated financial statements of the company  interest income or expense is reported net of the associated inflationary losses or gains  respectively  and accordingly depends on the relationship between the rate of interest and  where applicable  indexation of principal and the rate of inflation as measured by the ufir  which is used to determine inflationary gains and losses 
for example  indebtedness denominated in reais gives rise to interest expense to the extent that the rates of interest plus indexation exceed the rate of inflation  and it may give rise to negative interest expense if the rates of interest plus indexation are less than the rate of inflation 
effects of inflation and devaluation on indebtedness denominated in foreign currency 
at december   the company had r  of indebtedness denominated principally in us dollars 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
the company does not hedge its obligations under its foreign currency denominated indebtedness 
in the consolidated financial statements of the company  the interest expense attributable to foreign currency denominated indebtedness is reported net of the associated inflationary gain and foreign exchange loss 
when the rate of inflation and the rate of devaluation differ substantially  the effect on reported interest expense can be substantial 
see selected financial data exchange rates and note to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
the company s financial statements are presented in accordance with us gaap and accordingly recognize certain effects of inflation and restate data from prior periods in constant reais of june  purchasing power 
such restatement has been effected using the integral restatement method correcao integral required by the cvm the brazilian securities commission to be used for financial statements of public corporations 
in periods of inflation  monetary assets generate inflationary loss  and monetary liabilities generate inflationary gain  due to the decline in purchasing power of the currency 
inflationary gains or losses on monetary assets and liabilities have been allocated to their corresponding income or expense in the income statement 
inflationary gains or losses without a corresponding income or expense caption have been allocated to other net operating income expense

venbo on march  is different from that prior to the acquisition  the following comparative financial data of the company for the twelve months ended december  proforma  and for the twelve months ended december  are herein included in an effort to facilitate a meaningful presentation of the evolution of the company s operating results 
since the implementation of real plan in june the brazilian economy has experienced declining levels of inflation rates  with a cumulative inflation rate for the three year period from july to june  as measured by the igp m a brazilian general price index  of 
considering the above  and the fact that there is a clear historical trend of decreasing inflation in brazil  management has made the determination that brazil is no longer a highly inflationary economy from july  onward  pursuant to fasb brazil fast food corp 
has been reporting its financial statements in brazilian reais since its acquisition on march  accordingly  operating results for the periods ended december  presented in the accompanying financial statements have been indexed and expressed in currency of constant purchasing power of june  by using a monthly index derived from igp m index 
the company believes that the igp m index is an appropriate general price inflation indicator to be used under us gaap 
for the twelve months ended december   the inflation as measured by the igp m was

the reduction in cost of restaurant sales is due to the continuous renegotiation of purchase terms and prices with suppliers and seeking alternative sources of products 
the increase of systemwide sales enabled the company to reduce the average cost of major products such as meat  french fries and ice cream  by approximately in the last two years 
this reduction was partly offset by an increase in costs of certain items such as bread and soft drinks  caused  mainly  by increased federal taxes on these items 
restaurant payroll and other employee benefits restaurant payroll and other employee benefits expressed as a percentage of net operating revenues increased slightly from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  this is primarily due to increases in salaries mandated by union driven agreements for rio de janeiro employees since october  and additional since october  as well as for sao paulo employees since july 
such increases have been partially offset by new procedures implemented in early i a thorough store headcount revision  resulting in a reduction in the number of assistant store managers and in the average number of store employees from in to in  ii adoption of a new recruiting program allowing for a greater degree of flexibility in manpower usage and lower costs of recruitment and replacement of the staff  and iii reductions in employee transportation costs through an optimization of bus routes
