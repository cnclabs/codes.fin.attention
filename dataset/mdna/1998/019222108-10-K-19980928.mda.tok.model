the decline in sales of core products reflected various internal and external factors 
a large part of this decrease was caused by the company s insistence for better margins on sales of distributed products  such as aluminum cylinders

louis  missouri facility in the second quarter of fiscal this is expected to reduce manufacturing costs while improving available capacity  and customer service

in the continued devaluation of asian currency has reduced international orders
