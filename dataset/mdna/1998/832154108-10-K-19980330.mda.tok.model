item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general smith micro  founded in  develops and sells personal computer communication software 
the company s communication software products include fax  video conferencing  video email  telephony and data transmission products 
the company shipped its first data communication software product in and  since that time  the company s revenues have been primarily the result of the market acceptance of its oem fax and data communication software products 
the company began providing video communication products in to both oem and retail customers 
in january  the company purchased certain fax software assets of mitek systems  inc to provide lan  internet and intranet fax transmission solutions designed for the corporate market 
the company recognizes revenues from sales of its software as completed products are shipped and from royalties from customers who are authorized to duplicate the company s software 
any material reduction in demand for the company s products would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company has continued to expand its business by introducing new products and its future success will depend in part on the continued introduction of new and enhanced oem  retail and corporate products that achieve market acceptance 
revenues are net of estimated returns and other adjustments at the time the products are shipped 
the company has allowed its customers to return unused software  constituting  and of the company s net revenues for  and  respectively 
returns include stock rotation for new versions of retail product releases that were  and of the company s net revenues for  and  respectively 
a small number of customers have historically accounted for a substantial portion of the company s revenues 
in june  com corporation com acquired us robotics corporation us robotics  to date the company s largest customer based on the percentage of revenues  as a wholly owned subsidiary 
sales to com primarily u 
s robotics and its subsidiaries  accounted for approximately  and in   and  respectively 
during   and  the company s three largest oem customers  including com  accounted for  and  respectively  of net revenues 
any reduction  delay or change in orders from such customers could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in april  the company entered into an oem agreement having an initial one year term with a wholly owned subsidiary of us robotics now a subsidiary of com 
the agreement superseded a previous agreement between the parties and automatically renews at the end of each one year term unless a party provides at least days notice of its intent to terminate the agreement at the end of the then current term 
during  the agreement automatically renewed according to its terms and certain other com entities hereinafter com  its affiliates and their subsidiaries will be referred to as com entities were added as parties pursuant to new addenda to the agreement 
under the terms of the agreement  the company granted certain pricing incentives to the com entities in consideration for which the company became the provider of fax  data  voice and telephony communications software for such com entities 
in addition  under the terms of the agreement  certain of the com entities agreed to place smith micro retail products and commercials for such products on certain of their compact disks 
the agreement does not require any com entity to purchase any minimum quantity of smith micro products and may be terminated by a party thereto at any time for any reason upon days prior written notice 
while the company believes that it has been the principal supplier of oem communication software products to us robotics  there can be no assurance that the com entities  including us robotics  will not seek additional sources for such products in the future 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that sales to the us robotics and the other com entities to which the company sells products in any future period will reach or exceed the historical levels of sales to us robotics 
a substantial decrease or delay in sales to the com entities would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the oem product ordering cycle beginning from placement of an order to shipping is very short 
oem customers generally operate under a just in time system and order software to be delivered as needed by their manufacturing operations 
the company s products are generally shipped as orders are received and  accordingly  the company has historically operated with little backlog  and does not consider backlog to be a significant indication of future performance 
as a result  sales in any quarter are dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter and are not predictable with any degree of certainty 
moreover  the company does not generally produce software in advance of orders and therefore has not maintained a material amount of inventory 
inventory in the retail channel exposes the company to product returns 
this exposure is considered when the allowance is made for product returns 
substantial returns of product from the retail channel could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by  the financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere 
historical results of operations  percentage relationships and any trends that may be inferred from the discussion below are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period

these reasons for the decrease were reflected in the decrease in revenue from com and motorola of and  respectively 
the decrease in retail sales was primarily driven by slower than anticipated sales of the video communication software product lines that the company believes continues to be impacted by the consumer s lack of acceptance of current video technology and pricing

gross profit decreased to million in from million in and gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased to in compared to in an increased percentage of revenue from royalty agreements  cost control measures and increased manufacturing efficiencies helped the company achieve only a slight decrease in gross profit percentage despite the decrease in sales 
gross profits as a percentage of net revenues decreased primarily due to the decrease in net revenue  an increase in inventory write offs resulting from releases of new version retail product releases during and an increase in royalty expenses primarily related to video products shipped

general and administrative expenses include expenses related to the general operations of the company 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in as a percentage of net revenues  general and administrative expenditures increased to in from in the company s cost control efforts reduced general and administrative expenses in most categories  particularly salaries and benefits  however  this reduction was offset by an increase in bad debt reserves

the company currently anticipates that capital expenditures will not vary significantly from recent years 
during early  the company used  in cash to acquire certain fax software providing fax over lans  the internet and intranets and related assets from mitek systems  inc the company has no other significant capital commitments 
year compliance many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  in less than two years  computer systems and or software used in many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
significant uncertainty exists in the computer industry concerning the potential effects associated with such compliance 
the company currently offers software products that are designed to be year compliant 
however  there can be no assurance that such products do not contain undetected errors or defects associated with year date functions 
the company has received confirmation from vendors of certain purchased software used for internal operations that current releases or upgrades are designed to be year compliant  if installed 
the company is in the process of determining whether to upgrade the current system or purchase a new system that is designed to be year compliant 
the company anticipates that all internally used software will be designed to be year compliant prior to operational requirements for year data 
the company currently believes that becoming year compliant will not have a significant impact on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
although the company is not aware of any material operational issues or costs associated with preparing its software products or internal information systems for the year  there can be no assurances that the company will not experience serious unanticipated negative consequences and or material costs caused by undetected errors or defects in the technology used in its internal systems  which are composed predominantly of third party software and hardware
