forward looking statements include statements regarding potential acquisitions  the anticipated performance of future acquisitions  recently completed acquisitions and existing properties  and statements regarding the company s financing activities 
all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to the company on the date hereof  and the company assumes no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
it is important to note that the company s actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied in such forward looking statements 
some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are set forth below 
risks associated with acquisitions risks associated with the addition of a substantial number of new properties the company is currently experiencing a period of rapid growth 
since the consolidation on december   the company has invested approximately billion in properties  as of the date of this filing 
the company s ability to manage its growth effectively will require it to apply successfully its experience managing its existing portfolio to new markets and to an increased number of properties 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage these operations effectively 
the company s inability to effectively manage its expansion could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
acquisitions could adversely affect operations or stock value consistent with its growth strategy  the company is continually pursuing and evaluating potential acquisition opportunities  and is from time to time actively considering the possible acquisition of specific properties  which may include properties managed or controlled by one of the associated companies or owned by affiliated parties 
it is possible that one or more of such possible future acquisitions  if completed  could adversely affect the company s funds from operations or cash available for distribution  in the short term or the long term or both  or increase the company s debt  or be perceived negatively among investors such that such an acquisition could be followed by a decline in the market value of the common stock 
assumption of general partner liabilities the company and its predecessors have acquired a number of their properties by acquiring partnerships that own the properties or by first acquiring general partnership interests and at a later date acquiring the properties  and the company may pursue acquisitions in this manner in the future 
when the company uses this acquisition technique  a subsidiary of the company becomes a general partner 
as a general partner the company s subsidiary becomes generally liable for the debts and obligations of the partnership  including debts and obligations that may be contingent or unknown at the time of the acquisition 
in addition  the company s subsidiary assumes obligations under the partnership agreements  which may include obligations to make future contributions for the benefit of other partners 
the company undertakes detailed due diligence reviews to ascertain the nature and extent of obligations that its subsidiary will assume when it becomes a general partner  but there can be no assurance that the obligations assumed will not exceed the company s estimates or that the assumed liabilities will not have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  an associated company may enter into management agreements pursuant to which it assumes certain obligations as manager of properties 
there can be no assurance that these obligations will not have an adverse effect on the associated companies results of operations or financial condition  which could adversely affect the value of the company s preferred stock interest in those companies 
risks relating to tender offers the company may  as part of its growth strategy  acquire properties and portfolios of properties through tender offer acquisitions of interests in public and private partnerships and other reits 
tender offers often result in competing tender offers  as well as litigation initiated by limited partners in the subject partnerships or by competing bidders 
due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation  the company could be subject to adverse judgments in substantial amounts 
as the company has not yet attempted an acquisition through the tender offer process  and because of competing offers and possible litigation  there can be no assurance that  if undertaken  the company would be successful in acquiring properties through a tender offer or that the tender offer process would not result in litigation and a significant judgment adverse to the company 
conflict of interest the company has acquired  and from time to time may acquire  properties from partnerships that robert batinovich  the company s chairman and chief executive officer  and andrew batinovich  the company s president and chief operating officer  control  and in which they and members of their families have substantial interests 
these transactions involve or will involve conflicts of interest 
these transactions may provide substantial economic benefits such as the payments or unit issuances  relief or deferral of tax liabilities  relief of primary or secondary liability for debt  and reduction in exposure to other property related liabilities 
despite the presence of appraisals or fairness opinions or review by parties who have no interest in the transactions  the transactions will not be the product of arm s length negotiation and there can be no assurance that these transactions will be as favorable to the company as transactions that the company negotiates with unrelated parties or will not result in undue benefit to robert and andrew batinovich and members of their families 
neither robert batinovich nor andrew batinovich has guaranteed that any properties acquired from entities they control or in which they or their families have a significant interest will be as profitable as other investments made by the company or will not result in losses 
dependence on executive officers the company is dependent on the efforts of robert and andrew batinovich  its chief executive officer and its president and chief operating officer  respectively  and of its other executive officers 
the loss of the services of any of them could have an adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of the company 
both robert and andrew batinovich have entered into employment agreements with the company 
certain tax risks general the company has elected to be treated as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  commencing with its taxable year ended december  no assurance can be given  however  that the company will be able to operate in a manner which will permit it to maintain its status as a reit 
qualification as a reit involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which only limited judicial or administrative interpretation exists  and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within the company s control 
the company receives nonqualifying management fee income and owns nonqualifying preferred stock in the associated companies 
as a result  the company may approach the income and asset test limits imposed by the code and could be at risk of not satisfying those tests 
in order to avoid exceeding the asset test limit  for example  the company may have to reduce its interest in the associated companies 
the company is relying on the opinion of its tax counsel regarding its ability to qualify as a reit 
this legal opinion is not binding on the internal revenue service irs 
consequences of failure to qualify as a reit if the company were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  the company would be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at corporate rates 
moreover  unless entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions  the company also would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost 
this treatment would reduce the net earnings of the company available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability to the company for the years involved 
in addition  distributions to stockholders would no longer be required to be made 
even if the company continues to qualify as a reit  it will be subject to certain federal  state and local taxes on its income and property 
possible changes in tax laws income tax treatment of reits may be modified  prospectively or retroactively  by legislative  judicial or administrative action at any time 
no assurance can be given that legislation  regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the tax laws with respect to the qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of this qualification 
in addition to any direct effects the changes might have  the changes might also indirectly affect the market value of all real estate investments  and consequently the ability of the company to realize its investment objectives 
risks relating to real estate environmental matters under federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations relating to protection of the environment environmental laws  a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances at such property  and may be required to investigate and clean up such contamination at such property or such contamination which has migrated from such property 
such laws typically impose liability and clean up responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such contamination  and the liability under such laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of responsibility 
in addition  the owner or operator of a property may be subject to claims by third parties based on personal injury  property damage and or other costs  including investigation and clean up costs  resulting from environmental contamination present at or emanating from such property 
environmental laws may also impose restrictions on the manner in which a property may be used or transferred or in which businesses may be operated  and these restrictions may require expenditures 
under the environmental laws  any person who arranges for the transportation  disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of investigation or clean up of such substances at the disposal or treatment facility  whether or not such facility is or ever was owned or operated by such person 
environmental laws also govern the presence  maintenance and removal of asbestos containing building materials acm 
such laws require that acm be properly managed and maintained  that those who may come into contact with acm be adequately apprised and trained  and that special precautions  including removal or other abatement  be undertaken in the event acm is disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building 
such laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers 
some of the properties  as well as properties previously owned by the company  are leased or have been leased  in part  to owners and operators of dry cleaners that operate on site dry cleaning plants  auto care centers  or to owners or operators of other businesses that use  store or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances 
some of these properties contain  or may have contained  underground storage tanks for the storage of petroleum products and other hazardous or toxic substances 
these operations create a potential for the release of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances 
some of the properties are adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain underground storage tanks used to store petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances 
several of the properties have been contaminated with petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances from on site operations or operations on adjacent or nearby properties 
in addition  certain of the properties are on  or are adjacent to or near other properties upon which others  including former owners or tenants of the properties  have engaged or may in the future engage in activities that may release petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances 
all of the properties presently owned by the company have been subject to phase i environmental assessments by independent environmental consultants 
some of the phase i environmental assessments recommended further investigations in the form of phase ii environmental assessments  including soil and groundwater sampling  and all of these investigations have been completed by the company or are in the process of being completed 
certain of the properties owned by the company have been found to contain acms 
the company believes that these materials have been adequately contained and that an acm operations and maintenance program has been implemented or is in the process of being implemented for the properties found to contain acms 
some  but not all  of the properties owned by partnerships managed by the associated companies have been subject to phase i environmental assessments by independent environmental consultants 
the associated companies determine on a case by case basis whether to obtain phase i environmental assessments on these properties and whether to undertake further investigation or remediation 
certain of these properties contain acms

although tenants of the properties owned by the company generally are required by their leases to operate in compliance with all applicable federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations and to indemnify the company against any environmental liability arising from the tenants activities on the properties  the company could nevertheless be subject to environmental liability relating to its management of the properties or strict liability by virtue of its ownership interest in the properties and there can be no assurance that the tenants would satisfy their indemnification obligations under the leases 
there can be no assurance that any environmental assessments of the properties owned by the company  properties being considered for acquisition by the company  or the properties owned by the partnerships managed by the associated companies have revealed all potential environmental liabilities  that any prior owner or prior or current operator of such properties did not create an environmental condition not known to the company or that an environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of such properties that could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition  either directly with respect to properties owned by the company  or indirectly with respect to properties owned by partnerships managed by an associated company by adversely affecting the financial condition of the associated company and thus the value of the company s preferred stock interest in the associated company 
moreover  there can be no assurance that i future environmental laws  ordinances or regulations will not have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition or ii the current environmental condition of such properties will not be affected by tenants and occupants of such properties  by the condition of land or operations in the vicinity of the properties such as the presence of underground storage tanks  or by third parties unrelated to the company
