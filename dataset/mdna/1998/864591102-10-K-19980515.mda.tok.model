at january   the company owned and operated retail locations  compared to locations at february  during fiscal the company opened three company owned retail locations and closed eleven underperforming locations 
same store sales showed strong improvement with a increase 
as planned  the number of catalogs mailed during fiscal decreased to million 
through the implementation of more sophisticated systems to better track its direct marketing efforts  the company has improved the effectiveness of its catalog mailings 
cost of goods sold was of net product sales for the year ended january   compared to for fiscal the increase in the cost of goods sold percentage was principally attributable to higher wholesale sales during fiscal that have a lower gross profit margin and thus raise the overall cost of goods sold percentage 
during fiscal the company relocated its multiple manufacturing distribution facilities to a new  single facility

income taxes were  for the year ended january   compared to a  tax benefit for fiscal the fiscal tax benefit primarily relates to the recognition of a portion of the net deferred tax asset 
in prior years a valuation allowance was established against the net deferred tax asset due to the uncertainty as to whether the company would realize the net operating loss nol carryforwards 
during fiscal  the valuation allowance associated with the net deferred tax asset was reduced by  to zero 
as of january   the company has approximately  of tax net nol carryforwards 
approximately  of the carryforwards relate to deductions arising from the exercise of non qualified stock options 
these carryforwards comprised a large portion of the net deferred tax asset of  at january  to the extent the nol carryforwards and existing deductible temporary differences are not offset by existing taxable temporary differences reversing within the carryforward period  the remaining nol carryforwards are expected to be realized by achieving future profitable operations based on the following during the past three years the company has assembled a new  experienced management team with the background  knowledge and incentives to grow the business profitably 
operating income significantly improved during fiscal and  after excluding the impact of the one time special charge  as compared to fiscal and the company expects to continue to experience savings and improved earnings from the cost containment efforts that were implemented during fiscal and prior years

the nol carryforwards do not begin expiring until as indicated above  realization of the recorded net deferred tax asset is dependent upon the company generating sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the nol carryforwards

the new order entry  inventory control  manufacturing  fulfillment  financial and point of sale systems are all year compatible 
the company is currently reviewing its other systems to determine if there are any year issues 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits  rather than four  to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in miscalculations or system failures 
the cost of addressing potential year problems are not currently expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations

the company s quarterly operating results may also vary depending upon such factors as the opening of new stores  new catalog mailings  and the timing of new product introductions by the company 
the company s cash requirements generally reach a seasonal peak in october to finance increased inventory levels needed to meet third and fourth quarter sales demand
