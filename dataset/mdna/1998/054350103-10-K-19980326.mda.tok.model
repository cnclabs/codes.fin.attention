item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with avondale industries  inc s the company or avondale consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elswhere in this form k 
overview the improvement in the company s operating results continued during fiscal with the company reporting record income from operations for income from operations increased above the level of the prior year while income before income taxes increased compared to fiscal the company s firm backlog at december  was approximately billion including estimated contract escalation exclusive of unexercised options aggregating approximately billion held by the us navy the navy including estimated contract escalation and approximately million held by a commercial customer for additional ship orders 
the firm backlog includes two navy contracts awarded in  the first of which was the exercise of a previously awarded option to construct an additional sealift ship for approximately million including estimated contract escalation 
the exercise of this option represents the sixth ship which the company has been awarded in the sealift program 
the six strategic sealift ships have a remaining backlog of approximately million including estimated contract escalation 
in addition  the navy holds an option to require the company to construct a seventh sealift vessel for an additional million including estimated contract escalation 
in the first quarter of  the navy exercised a portion of this option relating to approximately million for long lead time materials while the balance of the option is exercisable during the first quarter of delivery of the first two sealift ships is scheduled for as previously disclosed  in december the us navy awarded  and in april the general accounting office affirmed  a million contract to a company led alliance  which includes bath iron works bath and raytheon company raytheon formerly hughes aircraft company which later became a subsidiary of raytheon  to design and construct the first of an anticipated twelve ships under the navy s lpd program 
the contract award provides for options exercisable by the navy for two additional lpd ships to be built by the alliance 
under the terms of an agreement between the alliance members  the company will build the ship covered under the december contract  and  if the navy exercises the two options  the company would construct the second and bath would construct the third of the three lpd ships to be built under the initial contract 
raytheon is responsible for total ship integration and the alliance is using an advanced three dimensional ship design and modeling technology for the design and manufacture of the ship 
in order to fairly represent its role as the prime contractor under the lpd contract  the company is required to report in its financial statements as sales and cost of sales the entire contract amount for each vessel in the lpd program constructed by the alliance 
under the subcontracting agreements entered into between the company and each of bath and raytheon  the award fees that can be earned under the lpd contract are distributable among the alliance members in proportion to each member s performance and participation in the construction of the vessel for which the award was granted 
to the extent that the company s revenues include costs incurred and award fees paid to the other alliance members  such revenues will be recorded with no operating profit margin 
for additional information on the terms of the lpd contract award  the relationship between the members of the alliance and certain accounting considerations  see business overview 
also included in the firm backlog is the largest commercial contract ever awarded to avondale 
in june  the company was awarded a million contract for the construction of two  dwt crude oil carriers for the jones act trade to be built with double hulls in compliance with the oil pollution act of the contract also provides options exercisable by the customer for three additional ships 
delivery of the first ship is scheduled for the first quarter of vessel deliveries in fiscal include a mhc class coastal minehunter  representing the fourth and final minehunter constructed by the company for the navy 
additionally  during  the company delivered the final three vessels in a contract to retrofit four commercial tankers with double hulled forebodies and the remaining river hopper barges 
vessel deliveries expected in fiscal include the lsd cv and the first two strategic sealift vessels 
the company s operating results projected for are expected to be principally related to the strategic sealift  the icebreaker and the lpd contracts  while results projected for are expected to reflect primarily the sealift  lpd and arco product tanker contracts 
except for the lpd contract  the company records profits under the percentage of completion method of accounting based on direct labor charges 
see business overview 
although the company generally does not begin to record profits on its contracts until contract performance is sufficient to estimate final results with reasonable accuracy  actual profits taken with respect to such contracts may be affected if the company is required in the future to revise its estimate of the cost to complete one or more of such contracts 
as previously disclosed  certain of the company s operations closed in with the completion of their respective contracts 
two of these facilities were sold one in december and one in november and the one remaining facility is currently offered for sale 
with respect to the remaining property  the company currently is not aware of any material environmental liabilities to be incurred for site restoration  post closure monitoring commitments or other exit costs 
results of operations vs 
the company recorded net income of million  or per share basic and diluted  for compared to million  or per share basic and diluted  for net income for included an income tax benefit of million  or per share basic and diluted  which recognized  for financial reporting purposes  the benefit of certain net operating loss carry forwards available to offset estimated future earnings 
no similar benefit was recorded in income from operations for increased million  or  compared with this improvement is primarily reflected by operating profits recognized on the contracts to construct the six strategic sealift ships  the icebreaker and the lsd cv profit recognition began in for the sealift and for the icebreaker as contract progress was not sufficient to begin profit recognition until that time 
also contributing to the improved operating results during were operating profits of million generated by the company s marine repair  modular construction and wholesale steel operations 
these operating profits were offset  in part  by operating losses recorded on two commercial marine construction contracts 
during  avondale recorded additional losses of million on the contract to retrofit four single hulled commercial tankers with new double hulls the last of which was delivered in september  and an additional million loss on the contract to construct river hopper barges the last of which was delivered in november 
these losses resulted primarily from increases in the estimated labor needed to complete the contracts 
net sales for decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the decrease in net sales was due primarily to a reduction in production activity associated with contracts that are at or near completion 
the company recorded decreased net sales on the contract to retrofit four single hulled commercial tankers with new double hulls and the contracts to construct the seven t aos the last of which was delivered in may  the four mhcs the last of which was delivered in january  the lsd cv expected to be delivered in february and the three lsd cvs the last of which was delivered in march 
these decreases were partially offset by increased net sales recorded on the contracts to construct the six strategic sealift ships the first of which is expected to be delivered in  the lpd expected to be delivered in  the icebreaker scheduled for delivery in and the two  dwt double hulled crude oil carriers the last of which is scheduled for delivery in 
the contracts to construct the six strategic sealift ships  the lpd  the icebreaker and the two double hulled crude oil carriers collectively accounted for of the company s net sales 
gross profit for decreased million  or compared to this decrease is primarily attributable to the early stages of construction of the majority of the company s contracts in progress 
the company does not begin profit recognition until final results can be estimated with reasonable accuracy 
refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained elsewhere in this form k  for a discussion of the company s policies and procedures for revenue recognition 
in addition  the lpd and the two double hulled crude oil carriers are in the initial stages of contract performance which result in significant engineering design and material acquisition costs recognized without any operating margins 
as a result of the factors discussed herein  contracts which account for a majority of the company s net sales have little or no operating margins recognized 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased million  or  for compared to the overall decrease in sg a expenses was due primarily to a decrease in proposal preparation and related costs compared with those recorded in in connection with the preparation of the successful lpd proposal 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 reporting comprehensive income sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas 
the company is required to adopt both standards for fiscal refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained elsewhere in this form k  for a discussion of sfas and sfas management believes that the implementation of sfas and sfas will not have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial statements but may require additional disclosure 
in accordance with the us securities and exchange commission s staff legal bulletin no 
 the company has assessed both the cost of addressing and the costs or the consequences of incomplete or untimely resolution of the year issue and has determined that it is not material to the company s business  operations or financial condition 
vs 
the company recorded net income of million  or per share basic and diluted  for compared to million  or per share basic and diluted  for representing an increase of in net income over the prior year 
net income for and include income tax benefits of million  or per share basic and diluted  and million  or per share basic and diluted  respectively  as discussed below 
also included in and net income are million  or per share  basic and diluted  and million  or per share basic and diluted  respectively  reductions of a previously recognized loss which was recorded in prior years on the contract to construct three lsd cvs 
the reductions were due primarily to revisions of the total estimated contract cost as it neared completion 
in addition to the improvements on the three lsd cv contract  the increases in the company s operating results in reflect improved operating profits recognized on the seven t ao contract  which was completed in  and the lsd cv contract 
in addition  the company began profit recognition on the contract to construct five strategic sealift vessels for the navy 
also contributing to the increase in operating results for were operating profits of million recorded by the company s marine repair  modular construction and wholesale steel operations 
these profits were offset  in part  by losses recorded on two commercial marine construction contracts 
the company recognized an million loss on the contract to construct river hopper barges  primarily representing costs incurred in connection with the company s entry into this competitive market 
in addition  the company recorded a million loss with respect to the contract to retrofit four single hulled commercial tankers with new double hulls 
this loss resulted from several factors  the most important of which related to certain modifications to the hull design that were required in order to comply with american bureau of shipbuilding standards after construction had been commenced by the company in order to respond to a significantly compressed construction schedule caused by the customer s delay in obtaining financing 
in addition  this project was commenced prior to the time that the company s new automated production facility had become fully operational  and therefore did not benefit from the efficiencies which would have been realized from the completed factory 
finally  the pre delivery testing of the first vessel revealed a condition which required certain modifications causing the company to incur incremental costs 
the impact of these losses was mitigated by the fact that these contracts absorbed a substantial amount of operating expenses which  in the absence of these contracts  would have been allocated to other contracts 
in addition  these contracts have been important in the company s reemergence in the competitive commercial marine construction markets 
the tanker contract has also enabled the company to construct four forebodies which are patterned after the forebody of avondale s standard tanker  providing experience in constructing this portion of the vessel  enabling the company to refine the design and construction techniques  and furthering the company s progress toward achieving its stated goal of a more balanced mix of military and commercial work 
the first double hulled tanker was delivered on october  while the second hull was delivered january  the remaining vessels are scheduled to be delivered in may and september the company s net sales in increased million  or  as compared to the prior year 
the increase in net sales was due primarily to increases in sales revenues recognized on the contracts to construct the first five sealift ships  the icebreaker and the forebodies for four double hulled product tankers  which collectively accounted for of the company s net sales revenue 
the increase in net sales was partially offset by reductions in sales revenues recognized on the contracts to construct the three lsd cvs the last of which was delivered in march  lsd cv scheduled for completion in november  the seven t aos the last of which was delivered in may and four mhcs the third of which was delivered in july and the last vessel which was delivered in january 
the increase in net sales was also partially offset by reduced net sales recorded on paddle wheeled gaming vessels the last of which was delivered in 
the contracts to construct the three lsd cvs  the lsd cv  the seven t aos and four mhcs collectively accounted for of the company s net sales revenue 
gross profit for increased million  or  compared to the increase in gross profit was due primarily to profits recognized on the contract to construct the lsd cv and the seven t aos 
also contributing to the increase in gross profit was the start of profit recognition on the contract to construct the strategic sealift vessels 
the increase in gross profit was partially offset by the losses recorded on the barge and forebody contracts discussed above 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased million  or  for compared to the overall increase in sg a expenses was due primarily to increased labor costs  professional fees and related costs associated with the company s successful lpd proposal 
the company s and operating results include income tax benefits of million  or per share basic and diluted  and million  or per share basic and diluted  respectively 
as further discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  these amounts were principally the result of recognizing  for financial reporting purposes  income tax benefits from certain net operating loss carry forwards available to offset estimated future taxable earnings 
in and  the million and million respective tax benefits were offset by income tax provisions of million and million related to and operating results  respectively
