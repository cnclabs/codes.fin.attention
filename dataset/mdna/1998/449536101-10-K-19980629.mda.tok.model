in addition to product sales  the company s sources of revenue have consisted primarily of license or research payments pursuant to licensing or collaborative research agreements 
the company has entered into collaborative arrangements with corporate collaborators that provide for the development and marketing of certain origen systems 
these agreements provide fees and royalties payable to the company in exchange for licenses to produce and sell the resulting products 
in the near term  the company may selectively pursue additional strategic alliances although  over time  it expects an increasing amount of its revenues to be derived from sales of its products and royalties from corporate collaborations

per share on revenues of million for the year ended march  this compares with a net loss of million 
per share on revenues of million for the corresponding prior year ended march  during the current year  million of the company s revenue was generated from the sale of products  either directly by igen or from royalties on licensees sales 
this represents a increase from the million of revenue recorded last year from comparable sources 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company s license and contract revenue converted to royalty income based on product sales of corporate licensees

the company recorded royalty income from this agreement of million and  for the years ended march  and  respectively 
these amounts were offset by a million advance  secured by future royalties  received from bmg in january under the company s interpretation of the agreement which roche bm is disputing  estimated cumulative royalties due from roche bm which have not been recorded total at least million 
product costs were million or of product sales for the year ended march  compared to million of product sales for the corresponding prior year 
lower product costs and improved gross margins are attributable to a change in product mix between instruments  services and reagents and the reduction of sales to organon teknika for which the company received no gross margin 
operating costs  absent product costs  decreased to million in the current year compared to million last year 
during fiscal  research and development costs decreased million to million from million in fiscal due to expiring external collaborations 
partially offsetting this decrease was an  increase in marketing  general and administrative expenses in fiscal over the prior year due primarily to professional and legal fees associated with the company s litigation with bmg 
interest income  net of other expense  decreased  from lower interest income derived from lower cash balances through the first nine months of fiscal coupled with accrued interest expense associated with the advanced royalty agreement with bmg initiated during the fourth quarter of fiscal item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

fees from licenses and for contract research declined by million in fiscal to million and revenue from product sales and royalties increased to million in fiscal from million in the prior year 
this transition occurred primarily in the fourth quarter of fiscal as license and contract revenue declined by million while product sales and royalty income increased by  when compared to the increase in royalty income is directly attributable to royalties generated through the company s license agreement with bmg which launched its elecsys series of immunodiagnostic products in which are based on the company s origen technology

as it now stands  bmg will have the right to continue to market its elecsys products to hospitals and clinical reference laboratories during the term of the agreement unless and until the company is determined to have the right to terminate the agreement and then determines to terminate the agreement 
if the company elects to terminate the agreement  it would have a material adverse effect on the company s royalty revenue from license sales unless and until the company entered into a strategic partnership with another company that is able to develop and commercialize diagnostic instruments to central hospital laboratories and clinical reference laboratories 
there can be no assurance  if the company decided to terminate the agreement  that the company would be able to enter into such a strategic partnership on terms favorable to the company 
the company does not expect that failure to prevail in the hitachi litigation by itself would have a material adverse effect on the company s revenue or sales  since hitachi would continue to manufacture bmg instruments and the company would continue to earn royalties in connection therewith 
there can be no assurance that the company s failure in the hitachi litigation would not have a material adverse effect or the success by the company in the hitachi item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
continued litigation could have a material adverse effect on the company s intellectual property 
success by the company in the hitachi litigation could have a material adverse effect on the company s royalty revenues from sales of elecsys products to the extent that bmg s sales of elecsys or mosys instruments are hindered because it needs to find a new manufacturer for its instruments 
the company has incurred and expects to incur substantial additional research and development expenses  manufacturing costs and marketing and distribution expenses and costs related to the roche bm litigation in the future 
it is the company s intention to selectively seek additional collaborative or license agreements with suitable corporate collaborators  although there can be no assurance the company will be able to enter into such agreements or that amounts received under such agreements will reduce substantially the company s funding requirements 
additional equity or debt financing may be required  and there can be no assurance that these funds may be available on favorable terms  if at all 
the company s future capital requirements depend on many factors  including continued scientific progress in its diagnostics programs  the magnitude of these programs  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  changes in its existing license and other agreements  the ability of the company to establish development arrangements  the cost of manufacturing scale up and effective commercialization activities and arrangements
