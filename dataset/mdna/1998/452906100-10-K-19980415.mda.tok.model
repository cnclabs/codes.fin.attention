in june  imatron completed a private placement offering whereby  shares of heartscan series a preferred stock were sold at per share and realized net proceeds of  the preferred stock is convertible on a ten to one basis into heartscan common shares at any time 
mandatory conversion of the preferred stock into common stock will occur upon the successful completion of a heartscan initial public offering 
the heartscan series a preferred stock may be exchanged at the sole option of the holder into imatron common stock at an exchange price of per share until the earlier of a two year period following closing of the preferred stock offering  or b a heartscan initial public offering 
if there is no initial public offering within months of the preferred stock closing  holders may convert the heartscan series a preferred stock into imatron common stock  at a conversion price equal to the greater of per share or a discount from the weighted average closing price of imatron common stock for the day period immediately preceding months of the preferred stock closing and each date that is months thereafter to and including the th month of the preferred stock closing 
in march  subsequent to the company finalizing its consolidated financial statements  the securities and exchange commission sec announced its position on accounting for the issuance of convertible preferred stock with a nondetachable conversion feature that is deemed in the money at the date of issue a beneficial conversion feature 
the beneficial conversion feature is initially recognized and measured by allocating a portion of the preferred stock proceeds equal to the intrinsic value of that feature to additional paid in capital 
the intrinsic value is calculated at the date of issue as the difference of the conversion price and the quoted market price of the company s common stock  into which the security is convertible  multiplied by the number of shares into which the security is convertible 
the discount resulting from the allocation of proceeds to the beneficial conversion feature is treated as a dividend and is recognized as a return to the preferred shareholders over the minimum period in which the preferred shareholders can realize that return ie from the date the securities are issued to the date they are first convertible 
the accounting for the beneficial conversion feature requires the use of an unadjusted quoted market price ie no valuation discounts allowed as the fair value used in order to determine the intrinsic value dividend 
additionally  preferred dividends of a subsidiary are included in minority interest as a charge against income 
prior to applying to the accounting described above  in its previously issued financial statements  the company had not recognized an intrinsic value dividend on the heartscan preferred stock which was issued in june the discounted conversion features of this preferred stock into imatron common stock the immediate conversion at per share and the conversion in two years from the date of the preferred stock issuance at a discount was provided to the preferred shareholders  in essence to provide them with an exit strategy in the absence of a heartscan ipo see notes and 
thus the company did not believe a discount should be recognized on a contingently issuable security 
furthermore  at the time of agreeing to the terms of the transaction the per share immediate conversion price was above the market price of the company s common stock but at the time the heartscan preferred stock was actually issued  the market price had increased to and thereafter  it dropped below again 
accordingly  the company did not believe that any calculation of the discount should include the impact of this short term market fluctuation 
in december  the staff of the sec gave a speech further refining its march annoucement 
based on discussions with the staff of the sec in april  the staff concluded that the company should retroactively apply its annoucement because it should be applied to contigently issuable securities and  as discussed in the december speach  the portion attributable to the discount that could have been obtained immediately on conversion eventhough the share had not been registered yet should be recognized on the day the preferred shares were issued 
the balance of the discount based on a market value of per common share is being recoginized over two years from the date of issuance 
the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  have been restated to give effect to the accounting treatment described above 
the restatement resulted in a reclassification in the consolidated balance sheet of  reducing minority interests and increasing additional paid in capital equity and the recognition of a minority interest charge of  including  as of the date of the perferred shares were issued in the consolidated statement of operations increasing the company s net loss from  to  the remaining discount of  will be accreted to minority interests through june  the minority interest is recognized as an increase in minority interest in the balance sheet 
the restatement of the previously issued consolidated financial statements  in order to apply to the accounting described herein for the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion features  does not affect the cash flows of the company 
year compliance many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only digit entries in the date code field 
beginning in the year  these date code fields will need to accept digit entries to distinguish st century dates from the th century dates 
systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
as a result  in less than two years  computer systems and or software used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
the company is utilizing both internal and external resources to identify  correct or reprogram  and test its internal systems  for the year compliance 
the total cost of compliance and its effect on the company s future results of operations is being determined as part of the detailed conversion process 
the company is currently seeking to ensure that the software and operating systems included in its ultrafast ct scanner is year compliant 
failure or perceived failure of such product to be year compliant could significantly adversely affect sales of the company 
additionally  year issues could cause a significant number of companies  including current company customers  to reevaluate their current system needs and as a result consider deferring purchase of ultrafast ct scanner 
any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition
