item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations consolidated edison  inc cei was established as the holding company for consolidated edison company of new york  inc con edison on january  the following discussion and analysis relates to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes 
the financial statements include the accounts of con edison and all wholly owned subsidiaries and  therefore  also represent the consolidated financial statements of cei 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity cash and temporary cash investments were million at december  compared with million at december  these balances reflect  among other things  the timing and amounts of external financing 
in addition  at december  con edison had set aside million for the retirement of three long term debt issues 
cei expects to finance its operations  capital requirements and the payment of dividends to its shareholders primarily from dividends and other distributions it receives from con edison  and may also from time to time use external borrowings 
for information about restrictions on the payment of dividends by con edison  see note b to the financial statements 
con edison expects to finance its operations and capital requirements from internally generated funds and external debt financings  and may also from time to time make short term borrowings 
con edison s cash requirements are subject to substantial fluctuations during the year due to seasonal variations in cash flow and generally peak in january and july of each year when the semi annual payments of new york city property taxes are due 
to increase its financial flexibility  con edison initiated a million commercial paper program in january moody s investor service moody s  standard and poor s rating group s p and fitch ibca fitch rated con edison s commercial paper p  a and f  respectively 
see note c to the financial statements 
con edison s customer accounts receivable  less allowance for uncollectible accounts  amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the increase at year end compared with year end is primarily attributable to one less cash collection day in compared with in terms of equivalent days of revenue outstanding  these amounts represented and days  respectively 
regulatory accounts receivable amounted to a net credit to be refunded to customers of million at december  compared with a receivable recoverable from customers at december  of million 
the decrease at year end compared with year end is due primarily to the elimination in of electric and gas regulatory incentive mechanisms 
see note a to the financial statements 
deferred charges for enlightened energy demand side management program costs amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
these costs are recoverable from customers under the settlement agreement approved by the public service commission psc as discussed below 
con edison s net cash flows from operating activities for years through were as follows millions of dollars net cash flows from operating activities    less dividends on common and preferred stock net after dividends net cash flows in were higher than in due principally to reduced operations and maintenance expenses 
net cash flows in were lower than in due principally to lower incentive billings and higher costs for recoverable fuel and gas in storage 
financial ratios con edison s common equity ratio and interest coverage ratio continue to be high compared with the electric utility industry generally  an indication of con edison s continued financial strength 
con edison s common equity ratio was percent and percent at year end and  respectively 
con edison s interest coverage was and times for and  respectively 
see stock repurchase  below 
debt financings con edison issued a total of million of five year floating rate debentures  the interest rate on which is reset quarterly million in june and million in december in july con edison issued million of year debentures 
con edison s senior unsecured debt securities debentures and tax exempt debt are rated a  a and aa by moody s  s p and fitch  respectively 
con edison s subordinated debentures quics are rated a by moody s  a by s p and a by fitch 
refundings the psc has authorized con edison to issue securities for the refunding of its outstanding debt and preferred stock from time to time prior to the year refundings may be effected by means of any one or a combination of redemption calls  tender offers  exchange offers  negotiated transactions or open market purchases 
in february con edison issued million of year debentures and million of year debentures  to refund in march its tax exempt debt issued through the new york state energy research and development authority nyserda  debentures and debentures 
in december con edison issued million of year debentures to refund in january three series of tax exempt debt issued through nyserda 
in march con edison refunded million of certain series of its preferred stock with the proceeds from the issuance of million of year subordinated deferrable interest debentures interest payments on which are tax deductible  unlike preferred stock dividends and million of cash balances 
in may con edison issued million of year debentures  the proceeds of which were used to redeem  in advance of maturity  its debentures 
in august con edison issued million of year tax exempt debt through nyserda  the proceeds of which were used to redeem the outstanding tax exempt debt 
con edison used cash balances to redeem its outstanding debentures in december and its outstanding convertible preference stock in december stock repurchase to realign its capital structure with its evolving business risk  cei announced its intent to repurchase up to billion of its common shares  subject to psc approval and market conditions 
the repurchase is expected to be funded by con edison from internally generated funds  debt financings and  depending on the timing  the net proceeds of generating plant sales 
the psc is expected to act on the stock repurchase in march capital requirements the following table compares con edison s capital requirements for the years through and estimated amounts for and millions of dollars construction expenditures nuclear decommissioning trust nuclear fuel subtotal retirement of long term debt and preferred stock a total a does not include stock repurchases or debt refundings

cei expects to invest million in and in its subsidiaries other than con edison  including consolidated edison solutions  inc  formerly promark energy  inc  and consolidated edison development  inc  formerly gramercy development  inc electric capacity resources electric peak load in con edison s service area  adjusted for historical design weather conditions  grew by megawatts mw percent in this growth reflects primarily the robust local economy 
con edison s current resource plans indicate that its service area could require additional generation resources within the next five years 
however  con edison does not anticipate adding long term capacity resources to its electric system 
in a competitive electric market  unregulated entities  possibly including a subsidiary of cei  are expected to provide needed capacity resources as dictated by market conditions 
the psc approved the stock repurchase in march competition and industry restructuring in recent years federal and new york state initiatives have promoted the development of competition in the sale of electricity and gas 
in general these initiatives unbundle  or separate  the integrated supply and delivery services that electric and gas utilities have traditionally provided  and enable customers to purchase electricity and gas directly from suppliers other than their local utility 
under these initiatives con edison will continue to transport and deliver energy to customers in its service area  including energy from other suppliers  over its electric and gas systems 
the rates for such delivery services are expected to remain regulated on a cost of service basis 
the electric and gas transportation and delivery systems  along with con edison s steam system  which will also remain rate regulated  comprised more than percent of con edison s net utility plant at december  these initiatives have also fostered new unregulated energy supply and services businesses in which the subsidiaries of cei other than con edison may participate 
these new businesses will be subject to competition and different investment risks than those involved in con edison s utility business 
in april the federal energy regulatory commission ferc issued its order requiring electric utilities to file non discriminatory open access transmission tariffs that would be available to wholesale sellers and buyers of electric energy and allowing utilities to recover related legitimate and verifiable stranded costs subject to ferc s jurisdiction 
con edison s open access tariff took effect in july the company has billed approximately  under the tariff  subject to refund pending the outcome of a september hearing on the tariff before ferc 
fercis expected to act on the tariff in in addition  con edison and con edison solutions have been authorized by ferc to make wholesale sales of electricity at market based rates 
in january con edison  along with the other new york electric utilities  submitted a filing to ferc for approval of a restructuring of the wholesale electric market in new york state  including the establishment of an independent system operator iso that would control and operate most electric transmission facilities in new york as an integrated system  a new york state reliability council  which would promulgate reliability rules  and a power exchange that would establish visible spot market prices for wholesale energy 
in december con edison and the other new york utilities supplemented this filing with additional details regarding the proposed new market structure and a new iso governance structure based upon an unaffiliated iso board of directors 
in may the psc issued an order in its competitive opportunities proceeding endorsing a fundamental restructuring of the electric utility industry in new york state  based on competition in the generation and energy services sectors of the industry 
in september the psc approved a settlement agreement between con edison  the psc staff and certain other parties the settlement agreement 
see psc settlement agreement  below 
all of con edison s gas customers  either individually or by aggregating their demand with other customers  became eligible in to purchase gas directly from suppliers other than con edison 
psc settlement agreement the settlement agreement in the competitive opportunities proceeding provides for a transition to a competitive electric market through the development of a retail access plan  a rate plan for the period ending march  the transition  a reasonable opportunity for recovery of strandable costs and the divestiture by con edison to unaffiliated third parties of at least percent of its new york city fossil fueled electric generating capacity 
retail access con edison will implement an energy and capacity retail access program that will permit its customers to choose alternative energy suppliers 
the delivery of electricity to customers will continue to be through con edison s transmission and distribution systems 
the program will begin in june with up to mw of customer load 
the program will be expanded in increments and con edison will target the phase in of retail access to make it available to all of its customers by the earlier of months after the new york iso becomes fully operational or december  this schedule is subject to adjustment as circumstances warrant 
in general  con edison s delivery rates for retail access customers during the transition will equal the rates applicable to other comparable con edison customers  less a rate representing the market value of the energy and capacity 
rate plan in january con edison implemented an annualized rate reduction of million pursuant to the rate plan provisions of the settlement agreement 
additional rate decreases will be implemented during the transition 
the rate plan reduces the total generation related revenues that con edison would have received over the five year transition period had rate levels in effect on march  remained in effect by approximately billion  exclusive of additional revenue reductions from lower gross receipts taxes 
financing savings from any securitization of strandable costs  in excess of the amount of the savings that may be allocated by the psc for sbc programs defined below  and any further reductions in new york state gross receipts taxes  will be utilized for additional rate reductions 
in general  base electric rates will not otherwise be changed during the transition except in the event of changes in costs above anticipated annual levels resulting from legal or regulatory requirements including a requirement or interpretation resulting in con edison s refunding its tax exempt debt  inflation in excess of a four percent annual rate  property tax increases and environmental costs above pre determined levels  or in the event con edison s rate of return becomes unreasonable for the provision of safe and adequate service 
the settlement agreement also provides  among other things  for a non bypassable system benefits charge to recover  to the extent not otherwise recovered  the costs of required research and development  energy efficiency programs  programs to assist low income customers and environmental protection programs collectively  sbc programs 
in addition  the settlement agreement includes a penalty mechanism estimated maximum  million per year for failure to maintain certain service quality and reliability standards 
for any rate year during the transition  percent of any earnings in excess of a rate of return of percent on electric common equity will be retained for shareholders and percent will be applied for customer benefit  with one half of the amount to be applied to a reduction of rates or as otherwise determined by the psc and the balance to be deferred and applied to reduce con edison s generating plant balances through additional depreciation expense 
the rate of return calculation will exclude any incentive earnings and reflect any amounts by which the rate of return for earlier transition rate years fell below percent 
this earnings sharing will cease beginning in the year in which con edison fulfills its divestiture commitment or in which percent of the service area peak load excluding the existing load served by the new york power authority is supplied by entities other than by con edison 
divestiture commitment con edison has agreed to divest to unaffiliated third parties at least percent of its new york city fossil fueled electric generating capacity no later than december  and con edison may divest additional generating capacity 
it may be determined that divestiture should be advanced or delayed to maximize sales price or address other developments or that the percent divestiture commitment is not sufficient to mitigate market power 
con edison s fossil fueled electric generating units not divested to unaffiliated third parties will be transferred to an unregulated affiliate of con edison by december con edison will submit a detailed divestiture plan to the psc in march con edison has agreed to initiate the divestiture process with respect to at least percent of its new york city fossil fueled generating capacity within days after psc approval of the divestiture plan unless otherwise justified in the divestiture plan 
the psc could approve the divestiture plan as submitted or modify it to address market power or other concerns 
con edison will retain for its shareholders the first million of any net after tax gains from the divestiture of generating capacity 
any additional net gains or net losses from the divestiture  or from the transfer to an affiliate of con edison  of generating capacity during the transition will be deferred for disposition by the psc 
after the transition the difference between the remaining book value of generating plant and the net market values defined by divestiture will be reflected in the strandable costs to be recovered following the transition 
recovery of prior investments and commitments potential strandable costs for con edison include its fossil fueled generating plants  indian point nuclear generating unit  decommissioning of the indian point plant and contracts with non utility generators nugs 
under the settlement agreement  con edison will continue to recover its potential electric strandable costs during the transition in the rates it charges all customers 
in addition  con edison will provide for million of additional depreciation for its fossil fueled electric generating units that also supply the steam system 
also  as indicated above  certain excess earnings  if achieved  will be applied as an offset to strandable costs 
the settlement agreement provides that con edison will be given a reasonable opportunity following the transition to recover remaining electric strandable costs  as adjusted for net gains in excess of million or net losses from divestiture or transfer of con edison generating capacity  including a reasonable return on investments  through a non bypassable charge to customers 
for remaining fossil related strandable costs  the recovery period will be ten years and for the indian point nuclear unit  the recovery period will be the remaining operating license term of the unit 
with respect to its nug contracts  con edison will be permitted to recover at least percent of the amount by which the actual costs of its purchases under the contracts exceed market value after the transition 
any potential disallowance after the transition will be limited to the lower of i percent of the above market costs or ii million in dollars 
the potential disallowance will be offset by nug contract mitigation achieved by con edison after april  and percent of the gross proceeds of generating unit sales to third parties 
con edison will be permitted a reasonable opportunity to recover any costs subject to disallowance that are not offset by these two factors if it makes good faith efforts in implementing provisions of the settlement agreement leading to the development of a competitive electric market in its service territory and the development of an iso 
in october con edison  pursuant to the settlement agreement  requested the psc to defer certain costs related to agreements to terminate contracts with nugs for mw of capacity 
including these agreements  con edison has  since  entered into agreements to terminate nug contracts for approximately mw at a cost of million exclusive of interest  million of which has already been recovered from customers 
currently  con edison purchases capacity under nug contracts for plants with  mw of capacity 
see note g to the financial statements 
corporate structure the settlement agreement establishes guidelines governing transactions among affiliates 
without psc approval  con edison is prohibited from making loans to  or guaranteeing the obligations of  cei or any of its other subsidiaries  or pledging its assets as security for the indebtedness of cei or any of its affiliates 
see also note b to the financial statements 
con edison and the other subsidiaries must operate as separate entities  and transfers of assets  services and information between con edison and its affiliates are subject to certain restrictions 
con edison and the other subsidiaries must have separate operating employees  and non administrative operating officers of con edison may not be operating officers of any of the other subsidiaries 
transfers of employees from con edison to the other subsidiaries are also restricted 
accounting effect as a result of the settlement agreement  there have been changes to certain of con edison s accounting policies 
these changes  however  did not have a material effect on con edison s financial position or results of operations 
see note a to the financial statements 
electric rate agreement in april the psc approved a three year electric rate agreement effective april  however  the settlement agreement supersedes the provisions of the electric rate agreement that prescribe overall electric revenue levels for the months ending march  the settlement agreement also eliminated  effective april   the provisions of the electric rate agreement for incentives or penalties related to the enlightened energy program and customer service performance  the modified electric revenue adjustment mechanism eram and earnings sharing 
the principal features of the electric rate agreement were as follows limited changes in base revenues there was no increase in base electric revenues for the first rate year the months ended march  and rates were reduced by approximately million percent for the second rate year the months ended march  
earnings sharing the allowed rates of return on common equity in the first two rate years were percent and percent  respectively  based on an assumed percent common equity ratio 
primarily as a result of increased productivity  con edison s actual rates of return for the first two rate years exceeded a threshold level established for sharing earnings with customers 
as a result  con edison recorded provisions  before federal income tax  for the future benefit of electric customers of million for the first rate year primarily in the fourth quarter of and million for the second rate year million in and million in 
incentive provisions con edison was permitted to earn additional incentive amounts  not subject to the earnings sharing provisions  by attaining certain objectives for its enlightened energy program and for customer service 
there were also penalties for failing to achieve minimum objectives  and there was a penalty only incentive mechanism designed to encourage con edison to maintain its high level of service reliability 
con edison accrued benefits for these incentives of million in including million related to the prior year  million in and million in partial pass through fuel adjustment clause ppfac the electric rate agreement also provided for a fuel and purchased power cost savings incentive  which has been continued under the settlement agreement 
see note a to the financial statements 
con edison s earnings  before federal income tax  under the ppfac were increased by million in million of which was earned in the first calendar quarter under similar provisions of a electric rate agreement and million in for  primarily as a result of unscheduled outages at its indian point nuclear unit  con edison incurred a net penalty of million  before federal income tax  under the ppfac 
modified eram the agreement continued  in modified form  the eram rate making concept that was established in the agreement 
see note a to the financial statements 
for con edison set aside million to be refunded to customers for revenue overcollections under the eram provisions 
con edison accrued million for and million for for revenue undercollections under the eram provisions 
gas and steam rate agreements in january the psc approved a four year gas rate settlement agreement with the following major provisions base rates will  with limited exceptions  remain at september  levels through september   con edison will share in net revenue from interruptible gas sales previously used only to reduce firm customer gas costs by retaining in each rate year the first million of net revenue above million dekatherms and percent of additional net revenues  and percent of any increase in property taxes above levels implicit in rates will be recovered by offsetting amounts  if any  that would otherwise be returned to customers 
con edison will share with customers percent of earnings above a percent rate of return on gas common equity 
in september the psc approved a steam rate agreement between con edison and the psc staff 
the three year agreement provides for a million base rate increase  effective october  base rates for the remainder of the term of the agreement will not be increased or decreased except in certain limited circumstances 
in its order approving the steam rate agreement  the psc modified the agreement to require con edison to submit a long range plan for the steam system in time to be considered contemporaneously with the company s divestiture plan for fossil fueled generating capacity 
see psc settlement agreement divestiture commitment  above 
in october the psc approved three year rate agreements for gas and steam services 
pursuant to the gas agreement  rates were increased million percent for the first rate year and million percent for the second rate year 
con edison accrued million and million in and  respectively  for earnings under the incentive provisions of the agreement 
the gas rate agreement superseded the third rate year of the agreement and discontinued the incentive provisions effective october pursuant to the steam agreement  rates were increased million percent  million percent and million percent  respectively  for the three rate years 
financial market risks cei s primary market risks associated with activities in derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments  are interest rate risk and commodity price risk 
the interest rate risk relates primarily to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements  including maturing debt securities  and to variable rate debt 
in general  con edison s electric  gas and steam rates are not subject to change for fluctuations in the cost of capital during the respective terms of the current rate agreements 
con edison manages its interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed rate debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refundings of debt through optional redemptions and tender offers 
in addition  con edison  from time to time  enters into derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk 
there were no derivative financial instruments outstanding at december  the commodity price risk relates primarily to con edison s use of derivative commodity instruments to hedge its gas in storage 
in addition  con edison solutions uses derivatives to hedge its gas purchases 
con edison does not generally use derivatives to hedge its purchases of electricity  fuel to produce electricity and steam and gas  because the related commodity price risks are mitigated by the fuel adjustment provisions of its current rate agreements 
at december  neither the fair value of the derivatives outstanding nor potential  near term derivative losses from reasonably possible near term changes in market prices were material to the financial position  results of operations or liquidity of cei or con edison 
see note a to the financial statements for additional information about the fuel cost provisions of the rate agreements and gas hedging 
year exposure many information systems have been designed to function based on years that begin with cei expects that by the year it will have adapted its systems  to the extent it considers necessary  to process years that begin with  and does not expect that the costs of doing so will be material 
however  the company cannot predict the effect on it of any year problems of other entities such as suppliers  customers and service providers 
air quality the clean air act amendments of impose limits on sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide emissions from electric generating units 
under the reasonably available control technology provisions of the clean air act  new york and ten other member states of the northeast ozone transport commission have entered into a memorandum of understanding that calls for the states to adopt more stringent nitrogen oxide standards 
con edison does not expect that compliance with the sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide standards will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
in july the united states environmental protection agency adopted new ambient air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter 
con edison does not expect that compliance with the ozone standard will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
if ambient air quality monitoring identifies new york city as a non attainment area for the particulate matter standard  the new york state department of environmental conservation dec will be required to adopt regulations to achieve compliance with the standard 
depending on the regulations  compliance with the standard may require increased operating costs and capital expenditures 
nuclear generation indian point station con edison has operated its approximately  mw indian point nuclear generating unit since it was first placed into service in at december  indian point had a net book value of approximately million 
see note a to the financial statements for a discussion of costs of decommissioning indian point and the retired indian point unit 
rate recovery the settlement agreement provides that  following the transition  con edison will have a reasonable opportunity to recover  through a non bypassable charge  its investment in indian point and the costs of decommissioning its nuclear operations 
see psc settlement agreement recovery of prior investments and commitments  above 
the settlement agreement does not contemplate the divestiture or transfer of con edison s indian point nuclear generating unit 
the psc is expected to institute a collaborative process to further consider issues raised by an august psc staff report on nuclear generating facilities 
operation under normal operating conditions  scheduled refueling and maintenance outages  such as the outage completed in july  are generally required for indian point after each cycle of approximately months of operation 
the unit was out of service from january  to march  and has been out of service since october  for unscheduled maintenance 
fuel disposal the united states department of energy doe has defaulted on its obligation under a contract with con edison pursuant to which doe was to begin to take title to con edison s spent nuclear fuel snf generated at indian point as doe transports the fuel to a federal repository for permanent disposal 
in july the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia held that the doe has an obligation reciprocal to the utilities obligation to pay fees  to start disposing of the spent nuclear fuel no later than january  in january con edison and a number of other utilities petitioned the court for an order directing the doe to begin acceptance of snf  authorizing payment into escrow accounts of fees that would otherwise be payable to doe pursuant to snf disposal contracts  and instituting enhanced judicial oversight of doe s performance under the contracts 
in november the court ruled that the petition was premature pending a determination of whether provisions of the contracts would afford an adequate remedy 
in march  the psc instituted a proceeding on nuclear generation and the nrc issued a confirmatory action letter regarding indian point see electric facilities generating facilities in item con edison estimates that it has adequate on site capacity for interim storage of its spent fuel until absent regulatory or technological developments by  con edison expects that it will require additional on site or other spent fuel storage facilities 
such additional facilities would require regulatory approvals 
in the event that it is unable to make appropriate arrangements for the storage of its spent fuel  con edison would be required to curtail the operation of indian point superfund and asbestos claims and other contingencies reference is made to note f to the financial statements for information concerning potential liabilities of con edison arising from the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of superfund  from claims relating to alleged exposure to asbestos  and from certain other contingencies to which con edison is subject 
impact of inflation cei is affected by the decline in the purchasing power of the dollar caused by inflation 
regulation permits con edison to recover through depreciation only the historical cost of its plant assets even though in an inflationary economy the cost to replace the assets upon their retirement will substantially exceed historical costs 
this is  however  partially offset by the repayment of con edison s long term debt in dollars of lesser value than the dollars originally borrowed 
forward looking statements this discussion and analysis includes forward looking statements  which are statements of future expectation and not facts 
words such as estimates  expects  anticipates  intends  plans and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
actual results or developments might differ materially from those included in the forward looking statements because of factors such as competition and industry restructuring  changes in economic conditions  changes in historical weather patterns  changes in laws  regulations or regulatory policies  developments in legal or public policy doctrines  technological developments and other presently unknown or unforeseen factors 
results of operations basic and diluted earnings per share were in and in and the average numbers of common shares outstanding for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in earnings for the year was primarily the result of lower operations and maintenance expenses  reflecting ongoing productivity improvements  partially offset by the impact of weather on net revenues and reduced incentive earnings under agreements covering electric rates 
earnings for  and reflect the electric  gas and steam rate increases and decreases and other provisions of the related rate agreements discussed above 
operating revenues and fuel costs operating revenues in and increased from the prior year by million and million  respectively 
the principal increases and decreases in revenue were increase decrease millions of dollars over over electric  gas and steam rate changes fuel rider billings sales volume changes electric gas steam gas weather normalization electric eram modified eram accruals recoveries refunds of prior rate year eram accruals rate refund provisions off system sales other total excludes costs of fuel  purchased power and gas purchased for resale reflected in base rates 
includes con edison direct customers and delivery service for nypa and municipal agencies 
the increases in fuel billings in and reflect increases in the unit costs of purchased power  fuel used to produce electricity and steam  and gas purchased for resale 
electric fuel costs increased million in  primarily because of the increased unit cost of fuel  partially offset by lower generation 
electric purchased power costs increased by million in over the period due to increased purchases 
the increases in electric fuel and purchased power costs in are also attributable to decreased availability of nuclear generation from indian point electric fuel costs increased million in  reflecting a higher unit cost of fuel  partially offset by lower generation 
electric purchased power costs increased by million in over the period  reflecting a higher unit cost of power purchased under nug contracts 
the increases in electric fuel and purchased power costs in were mitigated by the greater availability in of nuclear generation from indian point the cost of gas purchased for resale increased million and million in and  respectively  reflecting higher unit costs of purchased gas and higher sendout 
the unit cost of gas was percent higher in and percent higher in steam fuel costs decreased million in due to decreased generation of steam by con edison  partially offset by the higher unit cost of fuel 
steam purchased power costs increased million in due to increased purchases and higher unit costs 
steam fuel and purchased power costs increased million in due to the higher unit cost of fuel 
electricity sales volume in con edison s service territory increased percent in and percent in gas sales volume to firm customers decreased percent in and increased percent in transportation of customer owned gas other than for the new york power authority  which comprised approximately percent of the gas sold or transported for customers in  increased percent in reflecting increased purchases of gas from third party suppliers by con edison customers 
steam sales volume decreased percent in and increased percent in con edison s electricity  gas and steam sales vary seasonally in response to weather 
electric peak load occurs in the summer  while gas and steam sales peak in the winter 
after adjusting for variations  principally weather and billing days  in each period  electricity sales volume increased percent in and percent in similarly adjusted  gas sales volume to firm customers decreased percent in and increased percent in  and steam sales volume decreased percent in and percent in weather adjusted sales represent con edison s estimate of the sales that would have been made if historical average weather conditions had prevailed 
other operations and maintenance expenses other operations and maintenance expenses decreased percent in and percent in for the decrease reflects lower costs for pensions and retiree benefits  a percent reduction in the workforce and reductions in the enlightened energy program  partially offset by expenses for indian point outages 
for the decrease reflects lower production expenses  principally because there was an indian point refueling and maintenance outage in  but no outage in the decrease was offset in part by higher costs for pensions and retiree benefits due to changes in actuarial assumptions 
in and con edison accrued million and million  respectively  for environmental liabilities related to various superfund sites 
during con edison accrued million for environmental remediation costs relating to con edison facilities  pursuant to a settlement of a dec civil administrative proceeding against the company  and million for two superfund sites 
see note f to the financial statements for additional information about the settlement

the principal components of and variations in operating taxes were increase decrease millions of dollars amount over over property taxes state and local taxes on revenues payroll taxes other taxes total  including sales taxes on customers bills  total taxes  other than federal income taxes  billed to customers in were  million 
the increase in property taxes in reflects an increase in tax rates and the increase in reflects higher assessed valuations 
other income other income decreased million in due principally to the start up and business development expenses of con edison solutions and con edison development  partially offset by increased investment income 
other income decreased million in  reflecting primarily lower investment income 
net interest charges and preferred stock dividend requirements interest on long term debt increased million in and million in principally as a result of new debt issues 
the increase in relates to the preferred stock refunding discussed above  which substantially reduced con edison s preferred stock dividend requirements 
other interest expense decreased million in  principally as a result of lower interest costs associated with certain tax settlements and customer overpayments
