item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the company  which was founded in  is the largest outsource provider of traffic reporting services and a leading supplier of local news  sports  weather  video news and other information programming services to the television and radio broadcast industries 
the company provides customized information reports to affiliated radio and television stations in exchange for commercial airtime inventory 
the company generates revenues by packaging such commercial airtime inventory and selling it on a local  regional or national basis 
while the majority of the company s revenues are currently generated from sales of advertising on its radio information services network  the company is experiencing increased revenues from its expanded radio services network and its metrotv network 
the company s expenses are primarily comprised of three categories i operations  which includes all the expenses related to gathering  producing  and broadcasting information reports  ii marketing  which includes sales commissions  salaries and benefits for sales personnel  and iii general and administrative expenses  which include corporate overhead 
most of the company s expenses are associated with its radio traffic services 
however  during  and  the company incurred additional expenses attributable to the development of its metrotv services and development and operation of its expanded radio services including operating expenses incurred prior to the generation of significant revenue from both of these operations 
from through october  the business of the company was operated through the predecessor companies and all of the equity interests in the predecessor companies were owned by the saperstein family 
see business reorganization 
immediately prior to the closing of the initial public offering  the controlling shareholder established the company as a holding company and consolidated the issued and outstanding equity interests in the predecessor companies into metro traffic control  inc by exchanging such interests for  shares of the company s common stock and  shares of the company s series a convertible preferred stock 
in november  metro traffic control  inc changed its name to metro networks communications  inc 
as the equity interests were held under common control and were contributed by the resulting shareholder of the company  the underlying assets are recorded at their historical costs  similar to pooling of interest accounting 
references to metro networks  inc in the consolidated financial statements of the company include the predecessor companies prior to the reorganization 
in the analysis set forth below  the company discusses ebitda  which consists of earnings before interest income  interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
ebitda does not represent cash flows as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and does not necessarily indicate that cash flows are sufficient to fund all of the company s cash needs 
ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income  cash from operating activities or other measures of liquidity determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the company believes that ebitda is a measure of financial performance widely used in the media and broadcast industries and is useful to investors 
in certain circumstances  the company engages in reciprocal arrangements with advertisers whereby the company exchanges a portion of its unsold commercial airtime inventory for goods and services 
the company believes that reciprocal transactions are common in the broadcasting industry 
in  revenues from reciprocal arrangements accounted for of total revenues and declined to in and in the company s advertising revenues vary over the calendar year with the first quarter generally reflecting the lowest revenues and the fourth quarter the highest revenues for the year 
expenses  other than marketing expenses  are generally spread evenly over the year  resulting in seasonality in the company s ebitda 
income taxes the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its wholly owned subsidiary  and  prior to the reorganization  the combined financial statements of the predecessor companies 
prior to the reorganization  mnw owned corporations which were taxed under the c corporation provisions of the internal revenue code 
taxes related to income from the entities taxed under the c corporation provisions are reported under the asset and liability method 
accordingly  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
subsequent to the reorganization  all of the operations have been included in the consolidated tax return of the company 
accordingly  at the time of the reorganization  the company recorded an increase in the deferred tax liability of  which represented the tax basis differential between financial and tax assets and liabilities associated with the s corporations and partnerships included in the reorganization 
prior to the reorganization  mri  mvn and mtc elected to be taxed under s corporation provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
under these provisions  mri  mvn and mtc are not liable for federal income taxes 
instead  the stockholders of such entities are liable individually for federal income taxes on their taxable income 
also  prior to the reorganization  mnw was a partnership for federal income tax purposes and accordingly  the partners were liable individually for federal income taxes on their respective partnership income 
accordingly  losses for these entities are not available to the company to offset income
