at march   the company operated stores compared to stores at march  the average jewelry units sold per comparable store decreased slightly  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this is due in part to the additional stores included in the comparable store base in fiscal that generally had lower dollar and unit sales volume than the company s older comparable stores

selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales primarily reflects higher expenses associated with new stores opened and acquired by the company

interest expense interest expense increased  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and as a percentage of net sales was unchanged at in fiscal and the increase in interest expense  which includes interest paid on bank borrowings  fees paid for letters of credit as part of the company s gold consignment program and gold consignment fees  primarily reflects an increase in total average borrowings under the company s revolving line of credit and an increase in the number of ounces consigned under the company s gold consignment program 
these increases were partially offset by a lower average interest rate on the revolving line of credit  which was in place for all of fiscal  and the use of the proceeds of a secondary offering of the company s common stock in june of to repay debt incurred in connection with acquisitions

the decrease in income taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes reflects the full year effect of certain tax planning strategies implemented during fiscal net income the company s net income increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the company believes that such increase resulted from the foregoing factors  among other things 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary ongoing short term capital requirements have been to fund an increase in inventory and to fund capital expenditures and working capital mostly inventory for new and acquired stores 
the company s long term liquidity requirements relate principally to the maturity of its long term debt in july of  operating lease commitments and store expansion 
the company s primary sources of liquidity have been funds provided from operations  a gold consignment program  bank borrowings and a public offering of common stock that was completed in june the company had working capital of million and million at the end of fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
see seasonality 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal versus  in fiscal net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal and fiscal primarily reflects net earnings plus depreciation  partially offset by increases in working capital requirements  including increases in inventory to support new and acquired store growth 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
these amounts reflect million and million of capital expenditures related to new and acquired stores in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
additionally  in fiscal  the company paid million for the acquisition of locations from silver gold 
in fiscal  the company paid million for the acquisition of locations 
net cash provided by financing activities was  in fiscal and million in fiscal these changes in net cash provided by financing activities over the last two fiscal years primarily reflect the company s expansion and acquisition activity during those periods 
during fiscal  cash provided by financing activities primarily reflects an increase in the company s revolving line of credit 
this increase was used to fund store expansion  acquisitions and an increase in inventory to provide merchandise for anticipated store openings and acquisitions 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal reflects the proceeds of an offering of common stock completed in july  partially offset by a repayment of funds previously borrowed under the company s revolving line of credit 
the company currently has an unsecured revolving line of credit facility  which expires july   that provides for maximum borrowings of million through a combination of cash advances which may not exceed million and letters of credit which may not exceed million to support the company s gold consignment financing program 
amounts borrowed under the facility generally accrue interest at the higher of i the prime rate of the company s primary lender minus basis points at march  or ii a rate based on overnight federal funds transactions with federal reserve system members plus basis points at march   however  the company may elect to have all or any portion of the outstanding balance under the facility accrue interest at a rate based on one  two  three or six month libor plus basis points at march  for a one month maturity  subject to certain restrictions 
fees are paid on letters of credit based on amounts outstanding at an annual rate of 
at march   the company had million available for cash borrowings under this revolving credit facility 
letters of credit in the amounts of approximately million and approximately million were issued at march  and  respectively 
the loan agreement contains various covenants which  among other things  limit certain corporate acts of the company such as mergers and acquisitions  require the company to maintain minimum ratios of indebtedness to adjusted net income as defined  current assets to current liabilities and indebtedness to capitalization as defined  place limitations on the company s ability to incur additional debt or grant security interests in its assets  and restrict the redemption  purchase or retirement of its capital stock 
the company utilizes gold consignment arrangements that allow the company to finance its gold merchandise at rates which are less than its traditional bank borrowing rates 
under the consignment arrangements  the company generally sells to a consignor the gold content of the merchandise that it owns and simultaneously has the gold consigned back to the company 
the jewelry containing the consigned gold is commingled with the gold jewelry owned by the company 
the company s obligation to the consignors is based upon the price of gold at the time of the sale by the company of the consigned gold and  therefore  is subject to fluctuation based on changes in the market value of gold 
if the gold ounces in merchandise held for sale by the company is about to be reduced below the amount of gold consigned  the company either repurchases the gold from a consignor or purchases additional gold jewelry from suppliers to support the amount of consigned gold 
in the event the price of gold at the time of such repurchases or purchases is greater than the price at the time the gold was originally sold to the consignor  the company s gross profit margin will be decreased 
the company does not engage  and currently has no plans to engage  in hedging transactions to protect against fluctuations in the market value of gold or to lock in prices for future purchases 
the company does  however  manage the amount of gold consigned in relation to its total merchandise available for sale in order to provide the company with the flexibility to consign or repurchase gold according to seasonal fluctuations in merchandise levels and sales 
during fiscal and  average financing costs under the consignment agreements were approximately and per annum  respectively  of the market value of the gold held under consignment 
additionally  the current consignment agreements require a letter of credit to support the market value of the gold consigned to the company 
the financing cost to the company of the consignment program is substantially less than the cost that would have been incurred if the company financed the purchase of all of its gold requirements with borrowings under its revolving credit facility 
the company s current gold consignment arrangements are terminable by either party upon either or days notice  depending on the consignor 
gold consignment programs are common in the gold jewelry industry and the company believes that  if the institutions with which it currently has gold consignment agreements were to terminate such agreements  it would have a number of opportunities to establish gold consignment programs with terms similar to its current arrangements 
during the last two fiscal years  the company has financed an average of approximately of the gold content of its merchandise under the consignment program 
as of march   the amount of gold consigned was  ounces with a value of million and  ounces with a value of million at march  the consigned gold is not included in inventory on the company s balance sheet and  therefore  there is no related liability recorded 
if the market value of gold increases  assuming the number of ounces consigned remain constant  the financing costs incurred by the company which are included in interest expense  and the repayment obligations to the consignors under the consignment arrangements  will increase in proportion to the increase in the market value of gold 
additionally  the amount of the letters of credit would need to be increased to support the increased market value of the consigned gold  thereby reducing the amount which might otherwise be available for cash borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility 
the company anticipates capital expenditures in fiscal to total approximately million  of which approximately million is related primarily to the construction of new stores and the renovation of existing stores and approximately million is related to the construction of a new warehouse and distribution facility 
the company currently anticipates opening approximately to new stores in fiscal as well as approximately locations acquired under an asset purchase agreement with sedgwick sales  inc the purchase of these locations will require approximately million plus costs for conversion to the company s formats 
the opening of a new store generally requires a total investment of approximately  including approximately  of inventory a portion of which is generally financed through consignment arrangements   for construction of the kiosk  fixtures  point of sale register and other equipment and supplies and  for pre opening expenses which are expensed when incurred 
the company believes that the expected net cash provided by operating activities  its gold consignment program and bank borrowings under its revolving line of credit facility will be sufficient to fund the company s currently anticipated capital and liquidity needs 
seasonality the company s business is highly seasonal 
due to the impact of the holiday shopping season  the company experiences a substantial portion of its total net sales and profitability in its third fiscal quarter ending december st 
during the last two fiscal years  the month of december  on average  has accounted for approximately of the company s annual net sales and of its annual income from operations 
the company has generally experienced lower net sales in each of the first  second and fourth quarters of each fiscal year  and lower net income or net losses in each of those quarters 
quarterly data set forth below is certain summary information with respect to the company s operations for the most recent eight fiscal quarters fiscal fiscal st nd rd th st nd rd th quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter in thousands  except per share data statement of income data net sales         gross profit         selling  general and administrative expenses         income loss from operation   net income loss   diluted earnings loss per share comparable store net sales increase decrease as a percentage of net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income loss from operations net income loss gross profit excludes depreciation on kiosks 
depreciation on kiosks is included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
if for any reason the company s net sales were below those normally expected for the third fiscal quarter  and  in particular  the month of december  the company s annual financial results would be materially adversely affected 
the seasonality of the company s business puts a significant demand on working capital resources to provide for a build up of merchandise for the holiday season 
historically  the company s working capital requirement is at its lowest level in january  increases steadily through the end of november  when it reaches its highest level  and declines rapidly through the holiday season 
the company s results of operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of a variety of factors  including fluctuations in the price of gold  the amount and timing of acquisitions and new store openings  the integration of recently acquired and newly opened stores into the operations of the company  the timing of promotions  fluctuations in the price of gold  and changes in national and regional economic conditions 
for example  earnings from operations in the first and second and fourth quarters of fiscal and have been adversely affected by the integration and assimilation of stores opened or acquired over the last three fiscal years 
this was due primarily to the relatively fixed nature of rent and other occupancy costs and selling  general and administrative costs associated with the recently acquired and newly opened stores  which had a significant adverse impact on these lower net sales volume quarters 
inflation the impact of inflation on the company s operating results has been moderate in recent years  reflecting the relatively moderate levels of inflation which have been experienced in the united states 
the company s leases for stores typically provide for a percentage rent based on store sales and  therefore  to the extent retail prices increase  there may be an increase in occupancy costs 
generally  the company prices its gold merchandise based on the price it paid suppliers for the merchandise and does not reprice the items based upon normal fluctuations in the price of gold 
while inflation has not had a material impact upon operating results  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
year compliance the company is aware of year issues existing in the programming code of some existing computer systems 
the company is currently working to identify  correct or reprogram  and test its systems for year compliance 
the company expects its year project to be completed on a timely basis 
however  there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems also rely will be timely converted or that any such failure to convert by another company would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems 
recent accounting pronouncements in fiscal  the company adopted sfas no 
reporting comprehensive income  which requires companies to report all changes in equity during a period  except those resulting from investments by owners or distributions to owners  in a financial statement for the period in which they are recognized 
the components of comprehensive income include net income and all other items of revenue  expenses  gains and losses that previously would have been reported directly in equity under sfas nos 
   and because the company has no other items of comprehensive income other than net income  a separate financial statement is not required and has not been presented 
in fiscal  the company adopted sfas no 
disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
this statement requires that public business enterprises report certain information about operating segments in complete sets of financial statements of the enterprise and in condensed financial statements of interim periods issued to shareholders 
it also requires that public business enterprises report certain information about their products and services  geographic areas in which they operate  and their major customers 
the company has evaluated the applicability of sfas no 
and concluded that it does not currently meet the criteria for segment reporting as defined in the sfas no 
accordingly  separate segment reporting has not been made
