item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis is provided to increase the understanding of  and should be read in conjunction with  the financial statements and notes 
historical results and percentage relationships among any amounts in the financial statements are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future period 
overview gtsi is one of the largest dedicated resellers of microcomputer and unix workstation hardware  software and networking products to the government 
the company currently offers access to over  information technology products from more than  manufacturers 
gtsi also performs network integration services  including configuring  installing and maintaining microcomputers in local area networks 
the company sells to virtually all departments and agencies of the government  many state governments and several hundred systems integrators and prime contractors that sell to the government market 
gtsi offers its customers a convenient and cost effective centralized source for microcomputer and workstation products through its competitive pricing  broad product selection and procurement expertise 
the company provides its vendors with a low cost marketing and distribution channel to the millions of end users comprising the government market  while virtually insulating these vendors from most of the complex government procurement rules and regulations 
changes in sales throughout the company s history have been attributable to increased or decreased unit sales  to expansion of the company s product offerings eg  peripherals  microcomputers and networking and workstation products  from through  to the addition of new vendors eg  ibm  sun  panasonic  apple and nexar  from through  and to the addition or expiration of sales contract vehicles eg  the addition of the desktop iv contract  the sewp i contract  the nih contract and the tda contract from through  and the expiration of the companion contract in and desktop iv systems ordering in 
the company s financial results have fluctuated seasonally  and may continue to do so in the future  because of the government s buying patterns which have historically favorably impacted the last two calendar quarters and adversely affected the first two calendar quarters 
the company s primary strategy is to focus on its core gsa schedule business and to compete aggressively on bids in order to win as many contract vehicles as possible under the various purchasing programs available to it in the government market 
with these contract vehicles in place  it is then possible for the company to use its significant product base and marketing knowledge to sell products which both meet customers requirements and provide an attractive financial return to the company

compared with sales 
sales consist of revenues from product shipments and services rendered net of allowances for customer returns and credits 
during  net sales decreased million or and were negatively impacted by million in higher industrial funding fees associated with the gsa and nih contracts 
these fees are collected by the company and remitted to the respective agency on a payment schedule determined by the respective agency 
decreased sales under gsa schedule and under open market contracts of million and million  respectively  were offset by increased sales under gtsi s various idiq contracts 
it is management s belief that the decline in open market sales is primarily attributable to recent changes in the procurement regulations that allow the government to purchase products by other means eg  gsa schedule contracts in a quicker and easier manner than was the case before such changes 
idiq contract sales rose during primarily as a result of higher revenue on the company s nih  tda and sewp contracts 
revenue from these contracts rose million  million and million  respectively  from however  higher sales from the nih  tda and sewp vehicles were offset by weaker sales activity on the gsa schedule b c contract 
sales of hewlett packard  compaq  panasonic  microsoft and nexar products increased million from the prior year and accounted for of gtsi s total sales activity by vendor 
this increase was offset by lower sales of ibm label products which decreased by million from the prior year 
backlog at december   was approximately million  down from approximately million at december  backlog was million at march  compared to million in the prior period 
the increase is primarily related to orders that were recorded as part of the btg division acquisition  which closed on february  backlog represents orders received but for which product has yet to ship 
generally  the company fulfills all orders within days from the time the order is received 
gross margin 
gross margin is sales less cost of sales which includes product purchase cost  freight and certain other overhead expenses related to the cost of acquiring products 
over the last seven years  gtsi has experienced lower gross margin percentages because of pressure on end user prices caused by the leverage of government agencies and other customers in negotiating low prices  the increasing maturation and shorter life cycles of leading microcomputer hardware and software products which causes customers to focus on price as the primary distinguishing factor among sellers of such products  and the use of low prices by competitors as the primary means to obtain government market share 
in addition  idiq contracts are complex and require service expenses  including warranty support and software upgrades 
gross margin percentages vary over time and change significantly depending on the contract vehicle and product involved  therefore  the company s overall gross margin percentages are dependent on the mix and timing of products sold and the strategic use of contract vehicles that are available to sell its products 
gross margin increased in by approximately million or  and increased as a percentage of sales from to 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded million in adjustments that were deemed necessary to provide for contractual obligations  and to reduce certain trade credits to the amounts ultimately expected to be realized 
other product cost factors that contributed to the improvement in the gross margin percentage during were the recognition of greater price protection credits and purchase discounts offered by vendors 
operating expenses 
operating expenses in decreased approximately million  or  and improved as a percentage of sales from to 
the change is primarily attributable to a million decrease in amortization expense associated with the accelerated write down of intangible assets which was recognized during the fourth quarter of interest expense 
total interest charges between and were relatively flat  although bank administrative and credit card fees were higher in by approximately million from the prior period 
these costs were offset by lower interest expenses due to reduced bank borrowings during certain times throughout income taxes 
in  a tax benefit of million was recorded as a result of the company s operating loss for that period  that was realized by carrying back the loss to prior years in which the company recognized taxable income 
compared with sales 
sales consist of revenues from product shipments and services rendered net of allowances for customer returns and credits 
during  sales decreased million or 
decreases in sales under idiq contracts and sales from other contracts of million and million  respectively  were partially offset by increased open market sales and sales under gsa schedule contracts 
the increase in open market sales primarily resulted from the inclusion of million of ibm label product originally purchased for sale under the company s desktop iv contract which was commercialized and sold via the open market during the first six months of if this product had been sold under the desktop iv contract as originally intended  open market sales in would have declined million when compared to the prior year 
it is management s belief that the decline in open market sales is primarily attributable to recent changes in the procurement regulations that allow the government to purchase products by other means eg  gsa schedule contracts in a quicker and easier manner than was the case before such changes 
sales under idiq contracts declined during primarily as a result of decreased sales under the company s desktop iv contract and the lack of sales under the companion contract which expired september  of million and million  respectively 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in sales under the company s nih contract of million and its sewp contract of million 
other new contracts procured by the company during took longer than expected to be awarded and  upon award to the company  did not generate sufficient revenue to offset the declining sales under contracts which had ended or were near completion 
the slight increase in sales under the company s gsa schedule contracts was primarily comprised of million of increased gsa schedule b c sales offset by a decline in sales under gsa schedule a of million 
during  there were no sales of the company s private label hardware  which was introduced in under the desktop iv contract a decrease of 
additionally  sales of apple products decreased approximately million 
these decreases were partially offset by sales of microsoft and panasonic products which increased approximately and  respectively  from million to million and from million to million  respectively 
sales of ibm label products also increased during from million to million primarily as a result of the company s inclusion of this product on its desktop iv contract 
as noted above  million of this product was ultimately sold via the open market during the first six months of during the period from august  date of the falcon acquisition to september   the number of employees exceeded applicable size standards necessary to qualify the company as a small business 
although the company cannot precisely quantify the specific effect of this change on its operations  it is believed that sales were negatively impacted during the period in which the company was not a qualified small business 
beginning september   the company once again began to compete for opportunities exclusively reserved for small business non manufacturers 
during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  the executive and legislative branches of the government could not agree on a budget for fiscal year although the company cannot precisely quantify the specific effect of the government s work stoppage on the company s operations  it is believed that sales were negatively impacted during these periods 
backlog at december   was approximately million  up by from backlog of million reported for december  backlog represents orders received but for which product has yet to ship 
generally  the company fulfills all orders within days from the time the order is received 
gross margin 
gross margin decreased in by approximately million or  and decreased as a percentage of sales from to 
the decrease in absolute dollars is primarily attributable to lower sales volume and adjustments of approximately million recorded by the company in the fourth quarter of such adjustments were deemed necessary to provide for contractual obligations  and to reduce certain trade credits to the amounts ultimately expected to be realized 
these adjustments were also the primary reason for the decline in gross margin percentage 
other factors that contributed to the decline in gross margin percentage during include the open market sale of near obsolete inventory noted above which earned little or no gross margin  a large drop shipment of product from one of the company s vendors directly to the customer at a lower than normal margin  several large software orders and the increased concentration of sales under the gsa schedule b c 
gsa schedule b c sales accounted for of sales as compared with of sales 
in  these sales earned margins lower than other company sales 
operating expenses 
operating expenses in increased approximately million  or  and increased as a percentage of sales from to 
this increase is primarily attributable to a million increase in amortization expense associated with the accelerated write down of intangible assets which was recognized during the fourth quarter of this change was offset by decreases in the provision for doubtful accounts receivable  personnel expenses and expenses for contracted services 
restructuring charge 
for the year ended december   the company recorded a million restructuring charge million after tax  or per share 
interest expense 
the approximate million or decrease in net interest expense in was due to a combination of lower average borrowings  lower interest rates and decreased bank fees throughout income taxes 
a tax benefit of million was recorded in as a result of the company s current year net operating loss 
this benefit was realized by carrying back the loss to prior years in which the company recognized taxable income 
in  the company determined that million of net deferred tax assets did not satisfy the recognition criteria set forth in statement of financial accounting standards fas  accounting for income taxes  and a valuation allowance was recorded against the applicable net deferred tax assets 
in  the company recorded a tax benefit of million 
new accounting pronouncements the company will adopt fas  reporting comprehensive income  and fas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  during the company is evaluating the impact of these statements on its consolidated financial statement presentation 
fas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  was adopted by the company during the first quarter of during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a charge of approximately million related to the impairment of intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition of falcon in fas  accounting for stock based compensation  was adopted by the company during this statement requires disclosure of the fair value of all stock based compensation using one of several option pricing models 
fas  earnings per share  and fas  disclosure of information about capital structure  were adopted by the company in the fourth quarter of  with no material effect on the company s consolidated financial statement presentation 
effect of inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material effect on its operations 
however  in the event inflation increases in the future it could at least temporarily adversely affect the profitability of gtsi s sales under its government fixed price contracts  which generally preclude the company from passing on inflation related or other increases in product costs to government customers during the term of a pre existing contract 
the company mitigates this risk in part by often obtaining agreements from certain of its suppliers prohibiting them from increasing their prices to gtsi during fixed price  term contracts 
seasonal fluctuations and other factors the company has historically experienced and expects to continue to experience significant seasonal fluctuations in its operations as a result of government buying and funding patterns  which also impact the buying patterns of gtsi s prime contractor customers 
these buying and funding patterns historically have had a significant positive effect on gtsi s bookings in the third quarter ending september each year the government s fiscal year end  and consequently on sales and net income in the third and fourth quarters of each year 
quarterly financial results are also affected by the timing of the award of and shipments of products under government contracts  price competition in the microcomputer and workstation industries  the addition of personnel or other expenses in anticipation of sales growth  product line changes and expansions  and the timing and costs of changes in customer and product mix 
in addition  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new product releases by leading microcomputer and workstation hardware and software manufacturers  delays in vendor shipments of new or existing products  a shift in sales mix to more complex requirements contracts with more complex service costs  and vendor delays in the processing of incentives and credits due gtsi  have occurred all of which are also likely to occur in the future and have adversely affected the company s operating performance in particular periods 
the seasonality and the unpredictability of the factors affecting such seasonality make gtsi s quarterly and yearly financial results difficult to predict and subject to significant fluctuation 
the company s stock price could be adversely affected if any such financial results fail to meet the financial community s expectations 
additionally  legislation is periodically introduced in congress that may change the government s procurement practices 
gtsi cannot predict whether any legislative or any regulatory proposals will be adopted or  if adopted  the impact upon its operating results 
changes in the structure  composition and or buying patterns of the government  either alone or in combination with competitive conditions or other factors  could adversely affect future results

see note to financial statements 
year the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the millennium year approaches 
the year problem is complex as certain computer operations will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to the issue is whether computer systems will properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
management is performing a preliminary assessment of the year compliance expense and related potential effect on the company s earnings 
since such assessment is yet to be completed  there can be no assurance that any potential year problem  if material  can be resolved by the company in a timely or cost effective fashion  or that any difficulty or inability in resolving such problem will not have a material adverse effect upon the company
