part i 
item business kentek information systems  inc kentek or the company is a leading supplier of heavy duty  high reliability  mid range  non impact laser printers and related consumable supplies and spare parts 
printers that print to pages per minute ppm and  to  pages per month characterize the mid range market 
the company s printers are designed primarily for high volume printing requirements  including i production printing applications which include printing invoices  forms  payroll  direct mail and check imaging  ii print on demand applications characterized by the use of a printer rather than a copy machine to generate multiple originals from digitally stored data on an as needed basis and iii computer network applications for connecting multiple users on a network in order to share a single heavy duty printer 
the company was incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware in its principal offices are located at wilderness place  boulder  co on april   the company completed its initial public offering ipo of  shares of its common stock at per share 
the company received  in proceeds net of offering costs of the company is the exclusive manufacturer of consumable supplies for its printers  with the exception of toner  which is manufactured exclusively for kentek to its specifications 
kentek estimates that its printers have an average useful life of approximately seven years 
over the useful life of these printers  the consumable supplies must be replaced several times each year under normal use conditions and  consequently  sales of consumable supplies and spare parts typically generate revenues in excess of three times the original cost of the printer and represent approximately of the total cost of ownership of the printer 
kentek currently sells its products to a broad base of oems  system integrators  and independent supplies resellers in the mid range market 
kentek s customers include banctec  ibm global services  lexmark  ncr  oce printing systems  printer systems international  standard register  tally and unisys 
the company believes its product offerings compete on the basis of its high printer reliability  the low total cost of ownership of its printers and consumable supplies  and the attractive pricing kentek offers its customers 
industry overview the market for non impact printers can be segmented based upon users need for speed ppm  duty cycle capacity of pages per month  functionality network connectivity  forms and fonts  and paper handling features and cost of ownership average cost per page over the life of a printer 
the average cost per page takes into account the initial purchase price  the cost of consumable supplies and maintenance costs 
at present  non impact printers generally can be divided into the following market segments low range 
this market segment  defined by printing speeds of less than ppm  is appropriate for personal desktop applications and small workgroup applications 
personal desktop printing for small and home offices typically requires a relatively inexpensive dot matrix  ink jet or non impact printer that is connected to a single personal computer 
small workgroup printing environments generally serve several personal computers or a small local area network 
the company believes that the primary selection criteria for low range printers are print speed and initial acquisition price 
mid range 
this market segment has broadened over the last months 
historically  it included printers with speeds of to ppm  that provided enhanced features such as continuous operation and higher duty cycle 
the past two years has seen the introduction of light duty  higher speed machines from companies such as hewlett packard  lexmark and xerox 
targeted for the requirements of the average networked office environment  these printers typically have many features in common with copiers including stapling  collating and duty cycles of less than  pages per month 
these printers are often referred to as digital copiers or mopiers 
the heavy duty portion of the mid range segment includes printers with speeds of ppm with duty cycles of  to  pages per month 
these printers typically demonstrate high reliability  high duty cycle  low cost per printed page and low maintenance 
they can handle complex print jobs  run continuously  and often have advanced computer and network connectivity 
printers in this range are typically utilized in three distinct applications production systems  print on demand applications and networks 
production systems serve specific  print intensive applications such as general accounting  invoicing  payroll  direct mail  check imaging and generation of mortgage or insurance forms and documents 
these operations share a need for either long periods of continuous operation or heavy use spread over the month and low cost per page 
the systems are typically connected to a mainframe  mini computer  or high end windows nt network 
print on demand applications use a printer as a digital copier for users who need to generate multiple custom documents on demand from a template stored on disk 
network applications use a printer to serve the print needs of multiple users connected to a network 
for many business applications  when aggregate usage exceeds  pages per month and or  page coverage the percentage of the page covered with toner is higher than a standard office memo  a heavy duty  mid range printer can provide a more efficient and cost effective solution than multiple low range printers or multiple light duty mid range printers 
additionally  a single  heavy duty mid range printer can offer a lower cost of ownership than multiple low range printers while providing the convenience of higher speed  high print quality and enhanced features such as duplex printing  advanced paper handling and larger memory capacity for storing fonts and customized forms 
heavy duty mid range printers can run continuously and hold sufficient paper and consumables to require only infrequent operator attention 
the consumable supply products for a mid range printer are a significant cost to the end user over the life of the printer and are roughly of the total cost of operation over the printer s useful life 
the consumable supply products include the photoconductor  toner  developer  fuser and cleaner 
end users typically purchase consumable supply products from the company that sold them the printer 
as one moves from the low range printer market to the mid range and high range markets  the revenues generated by sales of consumable supplies over the life of a printer increasingly exceed the revenues generated by the initial printer sale 
high range 
this market segment  defined by printing speeds of ppm or greater  provides higher duty cycle than the other categories 
high range printer applications include very high volume applications such as direct mail  public utility invoices and credit card statements 
principal products the company s objective is to provide a complete printer hardware  software and consumable supplies package that enables kentek s customers to easily install kentek printers within their systems and to meet the end user s ongoing supplies needs 
kentek s printers are designed to provide high print quality  ease of use and reliable operation under the conditions of continuous use found in production system  print on demand and network environments 
the company s printers typically have a usable life of seven years 
kentek printers employ technologies that result in lower incidence of paper jams and better durability than many other printers in the industry 
for example  the company utilizes a simple printer engine design incorporating a straight paper path that permits the use of a wide variety of printable media with an incidence of paper jams of approximately in  printed pages 
this characteristic  in conjunction with high volume paper handling accessories  permits kentek printers to operate continuously  unattended at full speed 
kentek pioneered the use of light emitting diode led technology in printhead design 
this technology is used to generate the individual pixels on the photoconductor 
the led array technology uses no moving parts and provides simple  direct and precise beam alignment from the diode array to the photoconductor 
in contrast  a laser beam printer utilizes a motor to drive a rotating polygon mirror at speeds of as high as  rpm and directs the scanning beam across the width of the photoconductor 
as the beam moves from one side to the other  the spot size modulation and magnification must be managed 
the company believes that its simple printer engine design and led array technology is more durable than laser beam technology  permitting higher duty cycles at lower costs 
the following descriptions illustrate the principal features of kentek s k kd  k kd  kd and kdx printers 
all printers in the company s current line have a rated duty cycle of at least  pages per month and interface with ibm  hp  dec and unix platforms through serial  parallel or network interfaces 
k printer kd printer 
the k kd incorporates the company s standard design features  including a straight paper path and led array printhead 
the k is capable of full page graphics printing at dots per inch dpi

available as an option is a mhz idt risc microprocessor to accelerate complex graphics 
the kd  a ppm duplex printer  was introduced in november kdx printer 
an extension of the kd  the kdx includes the features of straight paper path  led array printhead  dual component toner process and the sigs controller described below 
standard features of the kdx model also include a mhz pentium processor with an internal floating point co processor and to megabytes of ram  full graphics printing at dpi  multi active ports   per month duty cycle  one floppy disk drive  a gigabyte or larger internal hard disk  and dual cassette input trays containing a total of sheets and an output tray 
available as an option is electronic collation 
the kdx duplex printer was introduced in may of available as options on all of kentek s printers are  and  sheet input feeders   and  sheet output stackers  and printer cabinets 
kentek also designs and develops proprietary printer controller hardware and software to manage the complex tasks associated with communicating with multiple host computers over a network and coordinating complex print jobs at high speed 
kentek s printers generally include a printer controller image generation system or igs controller and a machine controller printer control logic or pcl controller  each with its associated software 
in  kentek invented a proprietary risc based image generation system rigs architecture that is used on the k kd and kd printers 
the rigs architecture uses higher speed microprocessors  expanded ram and enhanced asics designed to speed complex text and graphics manipulation 
kentek controllers come standard with hp pcle  hpgl printer control language emulations and tiff image decompression 
phoenix page postscripttm is available as a printer control language option 
sigs controller 
in may  kentek introduced its sigs controller system  which is used on its kdx printer 
the sigs controller uses an intel pentium r processor and an industry standard motherboard with to mb of ram  permitting a quick and straightforward upgrade path as faster processors become available 
in addition  the board incorporates a pci bus permitting the addition of industry standard connectivity add on cards 
the controller uses a kentek developed pci bus compatible multi function card to interface with the machine controller 
also  the sigs controller is based on the lynx operating system and xionic s intelligent peripheral systems software  postscript level ii  tiff and pcle  all industry standards 
the company believes that the use of such standards lowers its cost and reduces the time to market when compared to products with a more proprietary design 
consumables 
the company is the exclusive manufacturer of consumable supplies for its printers  with the exception of toner  which is manufactured exclusively for kentek to its specifications 
the company s consumable products are subject to re manufacturing or recycling by others 
although the company believes it has not historically lost a substantial amount of revenue to recycling or re manufacturing competition  there is no assurance that the company will not be materially and adversely effected by such competition in the future 
kentek has recently initiated work to develop its own line of remanufactured consumables 
product development the company believes that the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products are essential to its future success 
rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  and frequent new product introductions characterize the market for the company s products 
the company intends to continue to devote a substantial portion of its resources to research and development of high speed non impact printers  printer controllers  paper handling devices and software and consumable supply products 
the company attempts to maintain its technological competitiveness and position its products attractively by working with its customers to plan products that meet end users needs 
the company s current product development efforts are focused on its kw printer line  as well as on developing higher speed controller and software enhancements for its existing printer line and introducing new features such as highlight color and improved paper handling and additional consumable supply products 
the company believes that its success depends in part on its ability to enhance existing products and to develop new products that maintain technological leadership  meet a wide range of changing customer needs and achieve market acceptance 
kdf printer 
the kdf is anticipated to be introduced to customers in the first half of the kdf is a ppm printer designed to have superior print registration image registration from top of page within millimeter and the ability handle a wide variety of paper stocks and weights 
in conjunction with the kdf  the company plans to introduce a high capacity media feeder capable of feeding a similar variety of paper stocks and weights 
the company believes this product combination will help it penetrate the forms market 
kw product line the kw product line will offer a series of printers with speeds ranging from to ppm or more with an initial introduction of a ppm printer and will incorporate new features specifically addressing concerns of the production systems  print on demand and network computing market segments 
this will enable the company to bring high range performance to the mid range market segment 
the kw product line is a new design that will incorporate many of the fundamental characteristics of kentek s existing products  including a straight paper path  high speed and flexible controllers and software  and high reliability 
further  the standard kw printer will support wide format paper  increased paper handling capacity  dpi resolution  duplex printing  and a full speed highlight color option 
the kw product line also will include the sigs controller system  a scaleable pentium based controller motherboard  a pci bus that will increase data transfer rates and enable easy integration of co processors  and a multiple connectivity feature that will ease all types of network connectivity 
the company believes that the adoption of these industry standard processors and communication protocols will decrease the development and engineering cycles associated with implementing future product enhancements 
in addition  the company is designing consumable supplies for its kw printer line that will extend the life span of each component and reduce per page printing costs 
development work on the kw has taken longer than the company originally anticipated 
certain aspects of the technology development have proven to be very complex  requiring more time and resources than originally planned 
the company anticipates that it will continue to spend substantial resources over the next months in its efforts to bring the development of the kw to completion and introduce it into the marketplace 
the kw printers will be manufactured by kentek in boulder  colorado 
the company believes that locating manufacturing in the united states rather than in japan will reduce manufacturing costs and exposure to currency fluctuations 
in addition to printers and controllers  kentek is developing pre and post processing devices such as staplers  stackers and media feeders that are targeted for specialized needs of kentek s customers 
by focusing on the needs of specific vertical markets  the company believes it can increase its competitive position in the mid range market 
the company maintains product development centers in boulder  colorado for printer engine  controller and software development  and in nagano  japan  for printer engine and paper handling device design 
as of june  the boulder facility employed full time and contract engineering staff and nagano employed full time and contract engineering staff 
the company s r d expenditures for fiscal years ended june    were   and  respectively 
customers  marketing and support the company distributes its printers exclusively through sales to oem customers and system integrators 
in fiscal net sales to each of lexmark  tally and oce printing systems constituted greater than of the company s total net sales 
financial information regarding sales to principal customers is presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  which appear elsewhere in this form k 
the loss or decline of sales to lexmark  tally or oce printing systems would have a material adverse affect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
customers typically begin purchasing a printer only after they have completed a lengthy evaluation process and integrated the printer into their product lines 
this evaluation process includes participation in the early stages of the printer design process and qualification of production units as they become available 
in addition  before volume purchases of a commercially available product can occur  customers must develop marketing programs  including sales and service training 
this long sales cycle makes it difficult in the short term for the company to recapture lost revenues through sales to new customers or through sales of new products to existing customers 
kentek supports its customers through an array of sales literature  technical support and joint sales calling on value added resellers or end users 
the company identifies commercial niches where there is a strong need for the high reliability  high duty cycle and continuous operation features of kentek printers  then identifies new or existing customers that can penetrate that marketplace 
in this manner  kentek is able to leverage the resources of its sales and marketing organization 
the company has identified six key market niches community banking  direct mail  healthcare  insurance  forms producers and micr magnetic ink character recognition where it believes kentek printers have a competitive price performance advantage 
over the last fiscal quarter  the company has increased its sales force in an attempt to more fully exploit these opportunities 
in fiscal  the company plans to hire additional sales representatives in a further effort to increase printer sales both in the above niches as well as internationally 
consumable supply products for kentek s printers  excluding toner  are manufactured exclusively by kentek and distributed principally through its customers 
in addition  certain consumable supplies are distributed through third party resellers 
customers sell these consumable supply products and spare parts directly to their customers through resellers of their computer systems  or to independent supplies resellers for sale to such customers 
the company also sells its products directly to supplies distributors  where such sales do not adversely affect the company s oem customers 
the company purchases toner manufactured exclusively to kentek s specifications by outside suppliers 
kentek s consumable supply products used in ibm branded products manufactured by kentek are sold through lexmark pursuant to an exclusive relationship with the company under which lexmark is required to purchase its requirements of consumable supply products for ibm branded printers only from kentek 
under the terms of an agreement between ibm and lexmark  ibm may begin selling consumable supply products for ibm branded printers after march in order to do so  ibm would be required to purchase such consumable supplies from lexmark for resale by ibm or to incur engineering  tooling and manufacturing costs to enter the business of supply consumables for its customers 
as of june   the company s sales and marketing organization consists of nineteen persons  of whom seventeen are based in three locations in the united states  and two are located at a single office in europe 
the company complements its field sales support with in house technical sales personnel and a product support department to provide technical training and product support to its customers 
financial information about foreign and domestic sales  operating income and assets is presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  which appear elsewhere in this form k 
the company provides a two year warranty against defects in the company s printer products 
the company warrants its consumable supply products against manufacturing defects with an industry standard out of box warranty 
use of consumable supply products not manufactured or approved by kentek voids the user s warranty for both the printer and the consumable supply products 
the company believes that its commitment to quality has resulted in low warranty expense 
in the fiscal years ended june    and  the company processed warranty claims totaling   and  respectively 
manufacturing and sources of supply the company operates manufacturing facilities in boulder  colorado and in nagano  japan 
the boulder  colorado facility manufactures the photoconductor  developer  fuser  and cleaner consumable supply products 
the company manufactures high capacity sheet feeders and output stackers in its facility in nagano  japan 
the company designs and engineers its printer engines and supervises their assembly under contract with the nagano japan radio corporation 
the kw and future products in the kw printer line will be manufactured in boulder  colorado 
the company purchases toner manufactured exclusively to kentek s specifications by outside suppliers 
the company procures all of its component parts from outside suppliers including proprietary components associated with the production of both the printer products and the consumable supply products 
although the company generally purchases from multiple vendors  certain of the company s parts and components are obtained entirely or substantially from a single source 
the company owns all of the unique tooling and mask work used for production of these parts 
the tools for producing component parts of the printer engines reside with component suppliers in japan  while tooling designed and produced for manufacturing the components of the consumable supply products are located mostly in the united states 
the company employs proprietary asics in its controller products and relies on contract manufacturers to assemble its printed circuit boards 
in management s opinion  adequate sources of supply exist to maintain current production levels 
the company currently sources over of its piece part volume and approximately of the cost of the components for its consumable supplies in the united states 
the company believes that this has reduced its manufacturing costs and also reduced its exposure to currency fluctuation 
the company has significant operations in japan  where certain components of its printers are sourced  designed and manufactured 
operating expenses and production costs related to kentek s japanese operations are subject to fluctuations in the dollar yen exchange rate 
the company mitigates a portion of its currency fluctuation risk through a contractual risk sharing provision included in certain of its customer agreements that provides for adjustment of sales price in accordance with fluctuations in exchange rates as well as through the purchase of forwards in the foreign exchange market 
see item a 
in november  the company completed the sale of its  square foot facility in japan 
the facility had most recently been used for the manufacture of consumable supplies and was put up for sale when kentek transferred its manufacturing to the united states 
backlog aggregate backlog as of june  was approximately million  compared to approximately million as of june  in both fiscal and  a major customer of the company placed orders for delivery of product for a time horizon greater than three months if these excess orders were excluded from backlog calculations  total backlog would be approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal the reduction in normalized backlog is primarily due to the reduction in consumable supplies orders from lexmark resulting from the decline in the installed base of ibm branded and ppm printers 
backlog consists of customer orders  the majority of which are scheduled for shipment within three months following the order date 
the company also receives orders for immediate shipment  which may not be reflected in backlog at any given time 
purchasers of standard products may generally cancel or reschedule orders without significant penalty  and  accordingly  the company s backlog at any time is not necessarily indicative of future sales 
while the company has operated historically with a to day backlog of orders  results of operations for a given quarter are significantly dependent on orders booked and shipped during that quarter  and increasingly becoming more dependent on orders received during the quarter 
competition the company competes with many companies in the printer segment of its business  including hewlett packard  hitachi dataproducts  qms  konica  ricoh canon  xerox and fuji xerox  each of which sells non impact printers and has substantially greater name recognition  engineering  manufacturing and marketing capabilities  and greater financial and personnel resources than the company 
for certain applications  the company s products compete with similar speed impact printers manufactured by genicom  tally and printronix 
the company expects increased competition from established and emerging printer manufacturers and resellers  including fujitsu  kodak and minolta 
as a result of the complexity of the printer and consumable supplies manufacturing and distribution businesses  many of the company s principal customers are also current or potential competitors  including ibm  oce printing systems  printronix and tally 
in addition  the company s consumable supplies products are increasingly being remanufactured by third parties  however  the majority of customers still purchase the company s unique consumable supplies 
the principal elements of competition in the company s markets include total cost of ownership  product features  product quality and reliability  performance characteristics and responsiveness to customers 
proprietary rights the company regards much of its hardware and software as proprietary and relies on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  employee and third party non disclosure agreements  and other methods to protect its products and technology 
as of june   the company had us patents  german patents and united kingdom patents  all of which will expire in the period between july and september there can be no assurance  however  that the patents held by the company will protect the company s technology or provide meaningful competitive advantage 
in addition  there can be no assurance that measures taken by the company to protect its products and technology will be adequate or that the company s competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company s technologies 
in addition  the company has not applied for patents in japan 
moreover  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect the company s proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
other companies may assert patent  copyright or other intellectual property rights against the company 
if such a claim were made against the company  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to obtain a license to use such technology if necessary or that such license could be obtained on terms that would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial statements 
should the company s products be found to infringe a third party s protected technology  the company could be required to pay damages to the infringed party or be enjoined from manufacturing and selling such products 
the company could also incur substantial costs to redesign its products or to defend any legal action taken against it 
employees as of june   the company had a total of employees including full time and part time or contract 
there were full time and part time employees in manufacturing  full time employees in sales and marketing  and full time and four part time employees in general and administrative functions 
in addition  full time and part time employees were engaged in research and development 
of the employees  are located in the us  in japan and two in europe 
the company s employees are not represented by any union  and the company believes that its relationships with its employees are good 
item properties kentek leases its main facilities in boulder  colorado and nagano  japan 
in boulder  the company leases five buildings an approximately  square foot facility for sales  marketing  research and development  and general and administrative purposes  an approximately  square foot facility for consumables manufacturing and warehousing  an approximately  square foot facility for consumable supplies recycling  an approximately  square foot building for engineering design work  and an approximately  square foot facility for future manufacturing of the kw printer

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the registrant s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
overview the company sells mid range  non impact printers and related consumable supplies and spare parts 
since  more than  printers have been sold and  as a result  the sale of consumable supplies and spare parts represents a majority of the company s net sales 
from to  the company sold its printers  consumable supplies and spare parts exclusively to ibm 
since  the company has sought to reduce its dependence on ibm by expanding its marketing efforts to other oems 
in  ibm formally announced its intention to buy a competitor s line of mid range printers 
accordingly  sales of printers  consumable supplies and spare parts have continued to decrease as older printers are taken out of service thus reducing the installed base of customers who purchase consumable supplies and spare parts 
the company continues to manufacture its current printer models in japan and is therefore subject to fluctuations in cost related to the dollar yen exchange rate 
the company is developing the kw printer to meet the evolving needs of the mid range printer market and is manufacturing this printer in the united states 
operating results comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year net sales 
net sales decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal printer sales constituted and  respectively  of net sales in fiscal and consumable supplies and spare parts constituted and  respectively  of net sales in fiscal and the company derives the majority of its revenue from the ongoing sales of consumable supplies and spare parts to support its installed base 
as the installed base continues to decline  due to end of life and replacement  the corresponding decrease in sales could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
printer sales 
printer sales revenue decreased by from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this decrease is due primarily to increased competition in the printer market 
consumable supplies and spare parts sales 
sales of consumable supplies and spare parts decreased by from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this decrease was due to a declining ibm printer installed base  which resulted in lower consumable supply sales as well as an increase in market competition by third party remanufacturers of consumable supplies 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased by from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the gross margin percentage increased from to in the same period 
the shift of sales from printers to consumable supplies and spare parts  which have a higher gross margin  contributed to the improved gross margin percentage 
the decrease in the company s reserves for obsolete inventories and the continued strengthening of the dollar in relation to the japanese yen also contributed to the improved gross margin percentage 
the company continues to focus on inventory management and reduction of slow moving items 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decrease was a result of the sale of the company s property in japan  a decrease in sales and marketing expense and lower legal expenses due to settlement of all pending litigation 
research and development expense 
research and development expenses increased by from  in fiscal to  in fiscal fiscal includes a significantly higher level of expenses associated with the development of prototype kw printers and an increase in salary expense of approximately  the development staff has increased by more than personnel and the company plans to spend more than of fiscal sales on research and development expenses 
other income expense 
other income expense increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this increase reflects a one time book loss of  related to the sale of the company s property in japan recorded in fiscal the remaining increase of approximately  reflects better performance of investments and marketable securities as well as more cash available to invest in income tax expense 
income tax expense for fiscal was  compared to  for fiscal income tax expense for fiscal included additional tax expense related to the sale of the company s property in japan 
during fiscal  the company filed amended prior year tax returns  utilizing available research and development credits  which resulted in a substantial refund 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to in fiscal a reconciliation of the income tax rates to the federal statutory rate is presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year net sales 
net sales declined from  in fiscal to  in fiscal printer sales constituted and  respectively  of net sales in fiscal and fiscal consumable supplies and spare parts sales constituted and  respectively  of net sales in fiscal and fiscal printers 
printer sales decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decrease in printer sales was due to two major factors the introduction by hewlett packard of a competing page per minute printer  and the acquisition of siemens nixdorf the company s largest printer customer by oce
