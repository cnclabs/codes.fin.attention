write down of assets in connection with a refinancing of its indebtedness in  gbcc issued million discounted principal amount of deferred interest notes the ppi funding notes to hcc in exchange for million principal amount of notes issued by another gbcc subsidiary and held by hcc 
it was anticipated that one of hcc s primary methods of realizing the carrying value of the new notes would be through the utilization of existing tax net operating losses of the gbcc group 
as a result of hcc s distribution of gbcc stock at december   gbcc s tax net operating losses are no longer available for utilization in hcc s consolidated tax returns  accordingly  at december   hcc performed an evaluation of the collectability of the ppi funding notes 
based on i the planned utilization of million of such notes in connection with the acquisition from gbcc of the general partnership interest in the limited partnership which holds the aurora management contract see liquidity and capital resources financing activities below  ii management s intention  subject to the approval of the independent directors of gbcc  to utilize additional notes to acquire other assets from gbcc  and iii an evaluation of the future prospects for repayment based on cash flow projections and other available information  hcc established a valuation allowance in the amount of million at december  to adjust the carrying amount of the ppi funding notes to their estimated realizable value at that date 
hcc again evaluated the collectability of the million carrying value of the ppi funding notes at december  such evaluation was based  in part  on hcc s determination of the potential for repayment of the ppi funding notes by means of the available cash and noncash assets of ppi funding and its affiliates 
particular consideration was given to the filing for protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code by gbcc s most significant operating subsidiary on january  hcc concluded that an additional write down of its receivable in the amount of million at december  was necessary to reduce the carrying amount of the ppi funding notes to their estimated realizable value 
during november  hcc loaned million of the proceeds from the hcc refinancing see liquidity and capital resources financing activities below to an unaffiliated gaming company in the form of two million notes series a and series b 
the loans were payable in quarterly installments of principal and interest at the rate of prime plus one percent per annum commencing in february with the final payment due in november on february   both parties agreed to settle the outstanding obligations with the payment of million and the issuance of two new  short term obligations totaling million 
the million difference between the million carrying amount of the notes receivable and the agreed upon settlement has been reflected as a write down of the notes receivable as of december  during  management determined that certain properties in texas acquired as potential sites for future development should be offered for sale 
an evaluation of net realizable value for such sites resulted in a write down for the anticipated loss on disposal of the properties of million for the year ended december  no additional write downs were recorded in net interest expense net interest expense of the hcc group increased million and million  respectively  during and compared to the prior years 
the increase is primarily attributable to additional interest incurred with respect to the new parking garage at the aurora casino which is treated as a capital lease for financial reporting purposes and to the capitalization of interest at the tunica casino with respect to construction of its new hotel tower during the net interest expense increase is attributable to interest incurred on million of senior secured notes issued during october  partially offset by the elimination of interest from the retirement of previously outstanding debt 
such increases were partially offset by the increased capitalization of interest on construction projects 
gain loss on disposal of assets the gain resulted primarily from the sale of a company owned aircraft 
loss on disposal of assets during includes the sale of excess barges by hct which were acquired in january together with other assets of the partially completed tunica project from the project s previous owner 
the barges were sold to third parties at a price below management s estimate of net realizable value  resulting in a loss on the sale 
hcc consolidated items income tax provision benefit hcc and its subsidiaries have tax net operating loss carryforwards nol s totaling approximately million  none of which begin to expire until the year additionally  hcc and its subsidiaries have various tax credits available totaling approximately  which do not begin to expire until the year based on the operating results of the aurora casino and the tunica casino since commencement of their operations  management believes that it is more likely than not that future consolidated taxable income will be sufficient to utilize at least a portion of the nol s  tax credits and other deferred tax assets resulting from temporary differences 
accordingly  under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  the consolidated balance sheet reflects the recording of a net deferred tax asset of million as of december  subject to a change of control as discussed below not occurring  the ultimate recognition of this amount of deferred tax assets will be dependent on hcc and its subsidiaries ability to generate approximately million of taxable income for federal tax purposes prior to the expiration dates of the nol s and tax credit carryforwards and the reversal of other temporary differences 
net operating loss carryforwards sales by hcc or existing stockholders of common stock by a five percent stockholder  as defined in the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  can cause a change of control  as defined in section of the code  which would limit the ability of hcc or its subsidiaries to utilize these loss carryforwards in later tax periods 
should such a change of control occur  the amount of loss carryforwards available for use in any one year would most likely be substantially reduced 
future treasury regulations  administrative rulings or court decisions may also effect hcc s future utilization of its loss carryforwards 
extraordinary item hcc is required to make an offer to purchase not more than million in principal amount of its senior secured notes at each semiannual interest payment date 
on november   hcc made such an offer and redeemed million of the senior secured notes 
this early redemption resulted in an extraordinary loss of  reduced by an estimated income tax benefit of  during october  hcc completed the refinancing of million of senior notes as well as other debt incurred in connection with the construction of the tunica casino 
as a result  costs and fees incurred  together with the write off of unamortized transaction costs  resulted in the recording of an extraordinary item in the amount of million in year compliance management believes that its information systems are year compliant 
inflation management believes that in the near term  modest inflation  together with increased competition within the gaming industry for qualified and experienced personnel  will continue to cause increases in operating expenses  particularly labor and employee benefits costs 
seasonality historically  the aurora casino s operations have experienced some seasonality  with the peak activity occurring from may to september 
consequently  the results of hcc s operations for the first and fourth quarters have traditionally been less profitable than the other quarters of the fiscal year 
furthermore  management believes that seasonality may also cause fluctuations in reported results at the tunica casino 
in addition  the operations of the aurora casino and the tunica casino may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors  including chance 
such seasonality and fluctuations may materially affect hcc s casino revenues and overall profitability 
liquidity and capital resources since their openings on june  and august   respectively  the aurora casino and the tunica casino have become the principal sources of liquidity and capital resources for hcc 
prior to the commencement of operations of the aurora facility  hcc s principal business activities were limited to its approximate ownership of gbcc 
gbcc s principal sources of liquidity and capital resources were cash flow from the sands  proceeds from debt financings and proceeds from asset sales

in addition to operating expenses at the aurora casino and the tunica casino  uses of operating cash by the hcc group include interest payments on the senior secured notes million  costs to pursue development opportunities million and corporate overhead costs million 
subsequent to its distribution of gbcc common stock  the hcc group has tax net operating loss carryforwards totaling approximately million and tax credits available totaling approximately  due to the availability of such net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  management presently does not anticipate hcc and its subsidiaries being required to make significant tax payments in the near future 
financing activities during october  the hcc group completed the refinancing of its senior notes and first mortgage notes through a public offering of million of senior secured notes due november   discounted to yield per annum the hcc refinancing
