the company has a history of adapting its products to a continually changing marketplace and the historical increase of sales is primarily the result of developing new products and of increasing the unit sales volumes of existing products 
during  the company introduced and began shipping several new communications and mass storage interface products for the pcibus market and announced new products for the cpci market 
cpci is a new standard bus architecture that combines the attributes of the vmebus and pcibus hardware into a ruggedized industrial system for the embedded oem marketplace 
initially the company will migrate its wide area network adapter products to this new standard but later in  mass storage adapters based on scsi and fibre channel technologies will be available 
these new products will initially be directed toward telecommunications and industrial applications 
cooperative marketing relationships with ziatech corporation and vi computer inc  both selling processors for the cpci market  were announced in january even in this early stage of this emerging market  the company is seeing significant new business opportunities based on this technology

the engineering staff for this location has been assigned to accelerate certain of the company s wan development projects 
the company believes that redirecting these valuable engineering resources onto corporate projects will result in delivering wan products to market more rapidly 
the products and services of uconx will continue to be supported and sold  but consolidated revenues may be impacted in the short term 
in december  the company was awarded iso certification achieving compliance with quality standards developed by the international organization of standardization of geneva  switzerland

due to what appears to be a slowdown in orders for the customer s product that incorporates the company s i o subsystem product  this customer requested delays of its fourth quarter deliveries and has not placed any orders for product deliveries for the first half of the specialty software protocol business is typically project oriented which can result in fluctuations 
the volume of this business in was less than originally forecasted and at the end of  the company integrated the uconx organization into its corporate structure 
the products and services of uconx will continue to be sold but future engineering efforts will be more focused on pti s wan projects
