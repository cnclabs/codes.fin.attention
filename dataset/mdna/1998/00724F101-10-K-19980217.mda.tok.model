results of operations overview adobe systems incorporated adobe or the company develops  markets  and supports computer software products and technologies that enable users to express and use information across all print and electronic media 
the company licenses its technology to major computer  printing  and publishing suppliers  and markets a line of application software products and type products for authoring and editing visually rich documents 
the company distributes its products through a network of original equipment manufacturer oem customers  distributors and dealers  and value added resellers vars and systems integrators 
the company has operations in north america  europe  japan  and asia  pacific  and latin america 
in january  the company divested its prepress applications product business to a newly established company  luminous corporation luminous 
under the terms of the agreement  luminous continued to develop  market  and distribute adobe s prepress application products  and adobe maintained ownership of certain core technologies for adobe prepress products 
revenue from the prepress application business unit was approximately million in fiscal year in october  the company sold its remaining interest in luminous for approximately million  which was recorded as a realized gain 
revenue change change total revenue revenue growth in is attributable primarily to increased application products shipments resulting from the release of new and enhanced products 
in  revenue grew due to increases in both licensing activity related to the company s postscript interpreter and application products 
product unit volume as opposed to price growth was the principal factor in the company s revenue growth in application products revenue in both and no customer accounted for more than of the company s total revenue in   or change change product group revenue licensing percentage of total revenue licensing revenue is derived from shipments by oem customers of products containing the adobe postscript interpreter  adobe printgear software  and the display postscript system 
such adobe postscript products include standard roman printers as well as printers that work with japanese  chinese  and korean languages  imagesetters  and workstations 
licensing revenue is also derived from shipments of products containing the configurable postscript interpreter cpsi by oem customers 
cpsi is a fully functional adobe postscript interpreter that resides on the host computer system rather than in a dedicated controller integrated into an output device 
the configuration flexibility of cpsi allows oems and software developers to create and market a variety of adobe postscript products independently of controller hardware development 
adobe postscript products sell to the small office home office soho market  as well as the corporate enterprise and high end imagesetter markets 
adobe printgear software is targeted to the soho and home computer market 
royalty per unit is generally calculated as a percentage of the end user list price of a printer  although some components of licensing revenue based on a flat dollar amount per unit typically do not change with list prices 
licensing revenue in was unchanged from licensing revenue 
increased demand for cpsi  color capability  and adobe printgear products was offset by a number of factors affecting oems  primarily in the japanese and macintosh markets 
these factors included  but were not limited to  continuing weakness in macintosh related printer sales and in japanese personal computer and printer markets  as well as a slow pace of new adobe postscript and adobe printgear products being brought to market by oems 
the company has seen year to year increases in the number of oem customers from which it is receiving licensing revenue and believes that such increases are attributable to the continued acceptance of adobe postscript software  as well as the diversification of the company s customer base across multiple platforms 
during  a number of oem customers introduced new adobe printgear products that serve the soho market 
late in  some oem customers began to transition from adobe postscript level products to adobe postscript products 
this transition is expected to continue through also in the fall of  one of adobe s largest postscript customers  hewlett packard company hp  introduced a non adobe clone version of postscript in one family of monochrome laser printers 
the company continues to be cautious about licensing revenue in the short term because of the factors identified in the previous paragraph and the anticipated loss of revenue from monochrome laser printer products from hp 
change change product group revenue application products percentage of total revenue application products revenue is derived from shipments of application software programs marketed primarily through retail and distribution channels  however  adobe pagemill  adobe sitemill  adobe framemaker  and adobe acrobat products are becoming more widely distributed through vars and systems integrators 
adobe photodeluxe is primarily distributed through oem bundling agreements with digital camera  scanner  and personal computer manufacturers 
application products revenue growth in was primarily due to increased demand for adobe photoshop  the adobe acrobat family of products  adobe photodeluxe  adobe illustrator  and adobe pagemaker 
a new version of adobe photoshop was released in late fiscal  and new versions of adobe pagemaker and adobe illustrator were released in the first and second quarters of fiscal  respectively 
in addition  during the second half of  a new version of adobe framemaker across multiple platforms and in multiple languages  the windows version of adobe photodeluxe  and various other products in localized international versions were released 
the revenue growth in this area resulted from increased demand for adobe photoshop  adobe pagemill  adobe sitemill  adobe illustrator  and the adobe acrobat family of products  as well as demand for new products 
the increase was partially offset by decreased demand for adobe framemaker and adobe pagemaker products 
the company released adobe photoshop for both the macintosh and windows platforms  and adobe acrobat near the end of the fourth quarter of in addition  adobe pagemill and adobe sitemill  which were both released in late  added revenue in overall  revenue from the company s application products on the windows platform increased by in over  while application products revenue from the macintosh platform increased 
in  the windows and macintosh platforms accounted for and  respectively  of application products revenue  excluding platform independent and unix products  compared to and  respectively  in the company expects this trend toward the windows platform to continue for the foreseeable future 
at the end of  the company experienced a decline in revenue from the japanese market  due to reductions in sell through rates by the company s japanese distributors and corresponding higher inventory levels 
the company remains cautious about the economic conditions in japan as well as the fluctuating economic conditions in other asian countries in the short term 
direct costs change change direct costs percentage of total revenue direct costs include direct product  packaging  and shipping costs  as well as royalties  localization costs  and amortization of acquired technologies 
gross margin expressed as a percentage of revenue  in general  is affected by the mix of licensing revenue versus application products revenue  as well as the product mix within application products 
direct costs for application products decreased during as the company transitioned from distribution of its products on disk to distribution on cd rom media  which has a lower cost per unit 
in addition  certain acquired technologies became fully amortized during  and localization costs were lower in than in localization costs will vary from year to year depending on the timing of the release of new versions of products 
direct costs were slightly higher in compared to as a percentage of revenue due to higher localization costs 
also  there was a general decline in in adobe framemaker revenue and associated gross margins 
gross margin in is expected to be approximately the same as in as the cost savings from the continued shift to cd rom media is offset by higher localization costs 
operating expenses change change software development costs research and development percentage of total revenue research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and benefits for software developers  contracted development efforts  related facilities costs  and expenses associated with computer equipment used in software development 
research and development expense has increased over the last three years as the company has invested in new technologies  new product development  and the infrastructure to support such activities 
the increase reflects the expansion of the company s engineering staff and related costs required to support these efforts 
the company continues to make significant investments in the development of its adobe postscript and application software products  including those targeted for the growing internet market 
the company believes that investments in research and development are necessary to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced products 
accordingly  the company intends to continue recruiting and hiring experienced software developers 
while the company expects that research and development expenditures in will increase in absolute dollars  such expenditures are expected to remain approximately the same as a percentage of revenue 
change change software development costs amortization of capitalized software development costs percentage of total revenue during  software development expenditures on all products  after reaching technological feasibility  were immaterial and therefore were expensed as incurred 
certain software development expenditures on products developed by frame technology corporation frame and aldus corporation aldus prior to their acquisition by adobe were capitalized and were amortized over the lives of the respective products 
amortization of capitalized software development costs decreased in and as a result of achieving full amortization of all frame products by the end of and all aldus products by the end of the company expects that software development expenditures on all products  after achieving technological feasibility  will continue to be immaterial in the future and therefore will be expensed as incurred 
change change sales  marketing  and customer support percentage of total revenue sales  marketing  and customer support expenses generally include salaries and benefits  sales commissions  travel expenses  and related facility costs for the company s sales  marketing  customer support  and distribution personnel 
sales  marketing  and customer support expenses also include the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue  such as advertising  trade shows  and other market development programs 
increases in sales  marketing  and customer support expenses in both and are due to increased advertising and promotional expenditures for upgrades of existing products and further development of customer and technical support services to support a growing installed base of customers 
in addition  a portion of the increase relates to new product releases  increased investment in the windows market  and programs related to furthering worldwide recognition of the adobe brand 
for fiscal  sales  marketing  and customer support expenditures are expected to increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenue 
change change general and administrative percentage of total revenue general and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and benefits  travel expenses  and related facility costs for the finance  human resources  legal  information services  and executive and administrative personnel of the company 
general and administrative expenses also include outside legal and accounting fees  provision for bad debts  and expenses associated with computer equipment and software used in the administration of the business 
general and administrative expenses increased from compared to due to higher information system costs  legal costs  and employee costs primarily associated with a more comprehensive administrative infrastructure 
the increase over resulted primarily from frame integration costs in the first quarter of and a higher headcount entering fiscal in addition  the increase was driven by salary increases as well as higher systems and legal costs in the company expects general and administrative spending in to be slightly higher than levels in absolute dollars as the company continues to invest in an expanded and more comprehensive executive and administrative infrastructure 
change change write off of acquired in process research and development percentage of total revenue during   and  the company acquired seven software companies  in separate transactions  and accounted for them using the purchase method 
in each of these transactions  a portion of the purchase price was allocated to in process research and development and was expensed at the time of the acquisitions 
change change merger transaction and restructuring costs percentage of total revenue merger transaction and restructuring costs for were million 
this represents charges of million less the reversal of million of excess reserves related to restructuring costs recorded in prior years 
the charges were recorded in connection with the disposition of two business units previously owned by frame 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded merger transaction and restructuring costs primarily associated with the acquisition of frame of million and reversed approximately million of excess restructuring reserves related to the acquisition of aldus in as well as the remaining accrued restructuring costs related to a restructuring implemented by frame 
at november   the remaining accrued restructuring balance of million  included in other accrued expenses on the balance sheet  related to lease and third party contract termination payments  resulting from the planned closure of duplicate offices in europe and the united states 
these payments are expected to continue through the lease terms or negotiated early termination date  if applicable 
change change other nonrecurring items percentage of total revenue nonrecurring items in included a gain of million related to the divestiture of a product line partially offset by a million charge related to the acquisition of an intellectual property 
nonoperating income change change investment gain loss  percentage of total revenue investment gain loss consists principally of realized gains or losses from direct investments as well as mark to market valuation adjustments for adobe ventures lp investments 
in  the investment gain relates primarily to the company s liquidation of its investment in netscape communications corporation netscape through the distribution to its stockholders of  shares of netscape as a dividend in kind and the sale of its remaining netscape shares 
the gain arose primarily as a result of realized gains of approximately million and approximately million for the sale of a portion of the company s investment in netscape and its entire investment in luminous corporation  respectively 
also  a portion of one of the equity investments included in the adobe ventures lp portfolio was sold for a gain of million during and at november   the remaining portion of this investment was marked to market for an unrealized gain of approximately million 
these and other gains were partially offset by write downs on certain other investments 
change change interest and other income percentage of total revenue interest and other income consists principally of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments as well as foreign exchange transaction gains and losses 
the increase in interest and other income in from is primarily due to higher interest income in on higher average cash balances 
the slight decrease in from is primarily due to foreign exchange gains in compared to foreign exchange losses in income tax provision change change income tax provision percentage of total revenue effective tax rate the company s effective tax rate decreased in from primarily due to lower nondeductible charges for the write off of acquired in process research and development and higher tax exempt income 
the tax rate decreased significantly from primarily as a result of lower nondeductible charges  including merger costs  goodwill  and the write off of acquired in process research and development 
an analysis of the differences between the statutory and effective income tax rates is provided in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company expects that the effective tax rate for fiscal will be between and due to lower tax exempt interest income as a result of cash requirements for the company s stock repurchase programs 
net income and net income per share change change net income percentage of total revenue net income per share weighted average shares in thousands    net income in each of the three years included several one time charges  and in and  significant investment gains that would not normally be included in the company s operating results 
a reconciliation of the reported results of operations to the results of operations excluding these one time charges for each of the years follows income before income net income tax net income taxes provision income per share in thousands  except per share amounts reported results of operations    write off of acquired in process research and development costs   other nonrecurring items net investment gain    results of operations excluding one time charges gains    income before income net income tax net income taxes provision income per share in thousands  except per share amounts reported results of operations    write off of acquired in process research and development costs    restructuring costs    other one time charges   net investment gain    results of operations excluding one time charges gains    income before income net income tax net income taxes provision income per share in thousands  except per share amounts reported results of operations    write off of acquired in process research and development   acquisition of frame merger transaction costs   restructuring costs    other one time charges    effect of fourth quarter antidilutive common stock equivalents results of operations excluding one time charges    factors that may affect future results of operations the company believes that in the future its results of operations could be affected by various factors  such as delays in shipment of the company s new products and major new versions of existing products  market acceptance of new products and upgrades  continuing weakness in demand for macintosh application software and macintosh related printers  renegotiation of royalty arrangements  growth in worldwide personal computer and printer sales and sales price adjustments  consolidation in the oem printer business  industry transitions to new business and information delivery models  ongoing weakness in the japanese and other asian economies  and adverse changes in general economic conditions in any of the countries in which the company does business 
the company s ability to develop and market products  including upgrades of current products that successfully adapt to changing customer needs  may also have an impact on the results of operations 
the company s ability to extend its core technologies into new applications and to anticipate or respond to technological changes could affect its ability to develop these products 
a portion of the company s future revenue will come from these products 
delays in product introductions could have an adverse effect on the company s revenue  earnings  or stock price 
the company cannot determine the ultimate effect that these new products or upgrades will have on its revenue or results of operations 
although the company generally offers its application products on macintosh  windows  and unix platforms  a majority of the overall revenue from these products prior to has been for the macintosh platform  particularly for the higher end macintosh computers 
in  windows based application revenue exceeded that for the macintosh platform for the first time 
if there is a continuing slowdown of customer purchases in the higher end macintosh market  or if the company is unable to increase its sales to windows customers  the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected 
also  if the company broadens its customer base to achieve greater penetration in the corporate business and consumer markets  the company may need to adapt its application software distribution channels 
the company could experience decreases in average selling prices and some transitions in its distribution channel which could materially adversely affect its operating results 
in addition  to the extent that there is a slowdown of customer purchases of personal computers in general  the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected 
the company s oem customers on occasion seek to renegotiate their royalty arrangements 
the company evaluates these requests on a case by case basis 
if an agreement is not reached  a customer may decide to pursue other options  which could result in lower licensing revenue for the company 
in the fall of  hp began to ship non adobe clone software in some hp laserjet printers  resulting in somewhat lower licensing revenue to the company  although the impact was minimal 
the company expects a more significant impact on its licensing revenue  although it continues to work with hp printer operations to incorporate adobe postscript and other technologies in other hp products 
during late  the company experienced a decline in both application and licensing revenue from the japanese market  due to a weak japanese computer market and general economic conditions in japan 
in addition  at the end of fiscal  inventory levels for application products at the company s japanese distributors remained higher than what the company considers normal 
the company expects these adverse economic conditions to continue in the short term  and they may adversely affect the company s revenue and earnings 
although there are also adverse conditions in other asian economies  the countries affected represent a much smaller portion of the company s revenue and thus have less impact on the company s operational results 
through its acquisitions  the company has experienced significant growth 
the company s ability to effectively manage its growth will require it to continue to improve its operational and financial controls and information management systems  and to attract  retain  motivate  and manage employees effectively 
the failure of the company to effectively manage growth and transition in multiple areas of its business could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations 
the internet market is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an increasing number of market entrants that have introduced or developed products addressing authoring and communications over the internet 
as is typical in the case of a new and evolving industry  demand and market acceptance for recently introduced products and services are subject to a high level of uncertainty 
the software industry addressing the authoring for and communications over the internet is young and has few proven products 
in addition  new models for licensing software will be needed to accommodate new information delivery practices 
moreover  critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet including security  reliability  ease of use and access  cost  and quality of service remain unresolved and may affect the growth of internet use  together with the software standards and electronic media employed in such markets 
the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating income from its subsidiaries located in europe  japan  and asia  pacific  and latin america 
the company generally experiences lower revenue from its european operations in the third quarter because many customers reduce their business activities in the summer months 
while most of the revenue of the european subsidiaries is denominated in us dollars  the majority of revenue derived from japan is denominated in yen and the majority of all subsidiaries operating expenses are denominated in their local currencies 
as a result  the company s operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
to date  the accounting impact of such fluctuations has been insignificant 
the company s hedging policy attempts to mitigate some of these risks  based on management s best judgment of the appropriate trade offs among risk  opportunity  and expense 
the company has established a hedging program as described below in derivatives and financial instruments 
the program is used to hedge its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  primarily of the japanese yen 
the company s hedging program is not comprehensive  and there can be no assurance that the program will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates 
due to the factors noted above  the company s future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period 
additionally  the company may not learn of such shortfalls until late in the fiscal quarter  which could result in an even more immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
finally  the company participates in a highly dynamic industry 
in addition to factors specific to the company  changes in analysts earnings estimates for the company or its industry and factors affecting the corporate environment or the securities markets in general will often result in significant volatility of the company s common stock price 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 earnings per share 
sfas no 
establishes a different method of computing net income per share than is currently required under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
under sfas no 
 the company will be required to present both basic net income per share and diluted net income per share 
basic net income per share is expected to be higher than the currently presented net income per share  as the effect of dilutive stock options will not be considered in computing basic net income per share 
diluted net income per share is expected to be comparable to the currently presented net income per share 
the company plans to adopt sfas no 
in its fiscal quarter ending february   and at that time  all historical net income per share data presented will be restated to conform to the provisions of sfas no 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income

for its fiscal year in october  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
sop establishes standards relating to the recognition of all aspects of software revenue 
sop is effective for transactions entered into in fiscal years beginning after december  and will require the company to modify certain aspects of its revenue recognition policies 
the company does not expect the adoption of sop to have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations 
year issues the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the year approaches 
the year problem is pervasive and complex  as many computer systems will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
the year issue creates risk for the company from unforeseen problems in its own computer systems and from third parties with whom the company deals on financial transactions worldwide 
failures of the company s and or third parties computer systems could have a material impact on the company s ability to conduct its business 
the company s financial information systems include an sap system recently implemented in the united states and japan and an oracle system in europe that will be upgraded to the most recent version in the first quarter of fiscal these systems are believed to be year compliant 
the company is analyzing its remaining computer systems to identify any potential year issues and will take appropriate corrective action based on the results of such analysis 
management has not yet determined the cost related to achieving year compliance 
in addition  the year issue could affect the products that the company sells 
the company believes that the current versions of its products are year compliant 
the company s products are subject to ongoing analysis and review 
financial condition cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments change change cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments the company s cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments decreased in from primarily as a result of cash expended for the company s stock repurchase program 
these expenditures were partially offset by cash generated from operations 
cash equivalents consist of highly liquid money market instruments 
all of the company s cash equivalents and short term investments  consisting principally of municipal bonds  auction rate certificate securities  united states government and government agency securities  and asset backed securities  are classified as available for sale under the provisions of sfas no 
the securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
noncurrent liabilities and stockholders equity change change noncurrent liabilities and stockholders equity included above is stockholders equity  and at november   deferred income taxes of million related to unrealized gains and losses on equity investments  and obligations for put warrants of million 
the company has no long term debt 
stockholders equity as of november  was million  compared to million as of november  and million as of december  the year to year increases in stockholders equity include issuances of common stock under the company s stock option and employee stock purchase plans and  in  the reclassification of the put warrant obligation back to stockholders equity 
in and  the increase in stockholders equity was substantially offset by the repurchase of stock 
in september  the board of directors authorized  subject to certain business and market conditions  the purchase of up to  shares of the company s stock over the next two years 
under this program  as well as under previously authorized programs  the company repurchased  shares and  shares in and  respectively 
the company may continue to directly repurchase common shares and arrange options to purchase common shares  depending on market conditions and the company s cash requirements 
the company has paid cash dividends on its common stock each quarter since the second quarter of during  the company paid cash dividends of per common share 
in addition  during  the company distributed its holdings in netscape communications corporation and siebel systems  inc to the company s stockholders as a dividend in kind 
the declaration of future dividends  whether in cash or in kind  is within the discretion of the company s board of directors and will depend upon business conditions  the company s results of operations and financial condition  and other factors 
working capital change change working capital the decrease in working capital in fiscal from is primarily due to lower cash and short term investment balances as a result of the company s stock repurchase program 
cash flow provided by operations during fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal expenditures for property and equipment in totaled million 
such expenditures are expected to continue  including expenditures for computer systems for research and development  sales and marketing  product support  and administrative staff 
in the future  additional cash may be used to acquire software products or technologies complementary to the company s business 
net cash used by financing activities during was million  or million greater than in fiscal  primarily resulting from the repurchase of common stock and payment of cash dividends partially offset by issuance of common stock under employee stock plans 
the company believes that existing cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  together with cash generated from operations  will provide sufficient funds for the company to meet its operating cash requirements in the foreseeable future 
derivatives and financial instruments item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency hedging instruments the company transacts business in various foreign currencies  primarily in certain european countries and japan 
accordingly  the company is subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure is primarily related to yen denominated sales in japan and local currency denominated operating expenses in europe  where the company sells primarily in us dollars 
the company s japanese operating expenses are in yen  which mitigates the exposure related to yen denominated sales in japan 
in addition  the company hedges firmly committed transactions using primarily forward contracts with maturities of less than three months 
at november   the company held million of aggregate foreign currency forward exchange contracts for the sale of japanese yen  all of which expire at various times through february  the unrealized gains and losses associated with these contracts are not material 
the company s accounting policies for these instruments are based on the company s designation of such instruments as hedging transactions 
gains and losses associated with the mark to market of outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated and effective as hedges of existing transactions  for which a firm commitment has been attained  are recognized in income in the current period 
corresponding gains and losses on the foreign currency denominated transactions being hedged are recognized in income in that same period 
in this manner  the gains and losses on foreign currency denominated transactions will be offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency contracts 
the company does not anticipate any material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows as a result of these instruments 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor does the company hedge its foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
the company currently does not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in europe 
instead  the company believes that a natural hedge exists  in that local currency revenue from product upgrades substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses 
the company assesses the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge european currency exposure on an ongoing basis 
the company regularly reviews its hedging program and may as part of this review determine at any time to change its hedging program 
fixed income investments at november   the company had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities  including those classified as cash equivalents  of million 
these securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations 
an increase in interest rates could affect the market value of the company s fixed income securities 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on the company s investment portfolio as of november  this sensitivity analysis is based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus  plus  or plus basis points over a month time horizon 
the market value changes for a   or basis point increase in short term treasury security yields were not material due to the limited duration of the company s portfolio 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk 
the company does  however  limit its exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and strictly monitoring clear policies and guidelines for its fixed income portfolios 
at the present time  the maximum duration of all portfolios is limited to years 
the guidelines also establish credit quality standards  limits on exposure to one issue  issuer  as well as the type of instrument 
due to the limited duration and credit risk criteria established in the company s guidelines  the exposure to market and credit risk is not expected to be material 
put warrants and call options to facilitate the company s stock repurchase program  the company sold put warrants in a series of private placements in and each warrant entitled the holder to sell one share of adobe s common stock to the company at a specified price 
approximately million and million put warrants were written in and  respectively 
at november   approximately million put warrants were outstanding that expire on various dates through may that have exercise prices ranging from to per share  with an average exercise price of per share 
in addition  in and  the company purchased call options from an independent third party that entitled the company to buy million and million shares  respectively  of its common stock 
at november   approximately million call options were outstanding that expire on various dates through april and have exercise prices ranging from to per share  with an average exercise price of per share 
under these arrangements  the company  at its option  can settle with physical delivery or net shares equal to the difference between the exercise price and the market value at the date of exercise 
commitments the company s principal commitments as of november  consisted of obligations under operating leases  a real estate development agreement  and various service agreements with a related party 
during  the company entered into a real estate development agreement and an operating lease agreement in connection with the construction of an office facility 
in august  the construction was completed and the operating lease commenced 
the company will have the option to purchase the facility at the end of the lease term  in october in the event the company chooses not to exercise this option  the company is obligated to arrange for the sale of the facility to an unrelated party and is required to pay the lessor any difference between the net sales proceeds and the lessor s net investment in the facility  in an amount not to exceed that which would preclude classification of the lease as an operating lease  approximately million 
during the construction period  the company was required to pledge certain interest bearing instruments to the lessor as collateral to secure the performance of its obligations under the lease 
as of november   the company s deposits under this agreement totaled approximately million in united states government treasury notes and money market mutual funds 
these deposits are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
in  the company exercised its option under the development agreement to begin a second phase of development for an additional office facility 
in august  the company entered into a construction agreement and an operating lease agreement for this facility
