at december   these three categories accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the company s loan portfolio 
the interest rates charged for the loans made by the company vary with the degree of risk  the size and maturity of the loans  the borrowers depository relationships with the company and prevailing money market rates indicative of the company s cost of funds 
concentration of the company s lending activities in the real estate sector could have the effect of intensifying the impact on the company of adverse changes in the real estate market in the company s lending areas 
the ability of the company to continue to originate mortgage loans may be impaired by adverse changes in local or regional economic conditions  adverse changes in the real estate market  increasing interest rates  or acts of nature including earthquakes or floods  which may cause uninsured damage and other loss of value to real estate that secures the company s loans 
due to the concentration of the company s real estate collateral  such events could have a significant adverse impact on the value of such collateral or the company s earnings 
the following table sets forth the amounts of loans outstanding by category as of the dates indicated 
there were no concentrations of loans exceeding of total loans which are not otherwise disclosed as a category of loans in the table below

these loans were predominantly originated in sonoma and mendocino counties 
total residential loans declined  during the year as a result of normal prepayments 
as of december   residential mortgage loans totaled  or of total loans 
such loans declined  during the year due to prepayments and continuing restructuring of allied s balance sheet 
this restructuring was accomplished by a  loan sale in the second quarter of in  total residential mortgage loans decreased  the decrease in residential real estate loans is due primarily to loan sales of million during the second quarter of the sale was executed to restructure allied s balance sheet and consequently improve allied s capital ratios and reduce its interest rate risk 
in addition  in the third quarter of  the company swapped million of adjustable rate loans with fannie mae for a mortgage backed security which had a coupon rate of and was scheduled to mature in  this security  which was classified as available for sale  was sold prior to december   with settlement due from broker in january the company does not anticipate any further restructuring of the company s balance sheet through loan sales 
at december    or  of the company s residential real estate mortgage loans were fixed rate mortgage loans having original terms ranging from one to thirty years  another  or  were held as adjustable rate mortgages  substantially all of which adjust semi annually  based on the eleventh district cost of funds index published monthly by the fhlb 
the balance of these loans   or  consisted of multifamily loans  second mortgage loans and loans on improved single family lots 
the majority of the company s residential mortgage loans have been underwritten for the company s portfolio and do not necessarily meet standard underwriting criteria for sale in the secondary market 
approximately of the total amount outstanding had principal balances that were less than  the company s residential real estate mortgage loans predominately have loan to value ratios of or less  using current loan balances and appraised values as of the time of origination 
the company s general policy is not to exceed an loan to value ratio on residential mortgage loans without mortgage insurance 
the company generally does not make portfolio loans on a negative amortization basis

see mortgage banking 
real estate construction loans 
real estate construction loans are primarily for residential housing 
the primary market focus is toward individual borrowers and small residential and commercial projects 
the economic viability of the project and the borrower s past development record and creditworthiness are primary considerations in the loan underwriting decision 
the company had  in construction loans outstanding at december   comprising of its total loans 
these loans were principally located in northern california 
this represents a decrease of  or from in construction loans increased  or from approximately million of these loans consisted of single family individual borrower construction loans  and the remaining loans included subdivision projects  land development projects and commercial projects 
at december   the largest single family construction loan commitment was  and the average commitment was less than  the largest commitment for a subdivision project was million  and the average subdivision commitment was less than  the average commercial project involved a loan of approximately  construction loans are funded on a line item  percentage of completion basis 
as the builder completes various line items foundation  framing  electrical  etc 
of the project  or portions of those line items  the work is reviewed by one of several independent inspectors hired by the company 
upon approval from the inspector  the company funds the draw request according to the percentage completion of the line items that have been approved 
the company rotates inspectors during construction to insure independent review 
actual funding checks must be signed by an officer of the company  and that officer must also initial the line item worksheet used to support the draw request 
in addition  company personnel or agents routinely inspect the various construction projects  all of which are located in the company s lending area 
commercial real estate mortgage and construction lending contains potential risks which are not inherent in other types of commercial loans 
these potential risks include declines in market values of underlying real property collateral and  with respect to construction lending  delays or cost overruns which could expose the company to loss 
in addition  risks in commercial real estate lending include declines in commercial real estate values  general economic conditions surrounding the commercial real estate properties  and vacancy rates 
a decline in the general economic conditions or real estate values within the company s market area could have a negative impact on the performance of the loan portfolio or value of the collateral 
because the company lends primarily within its market area  the real property collateral for its loans is similarly concentrated  rather than diversified over a broader geographic area 
the company could therefore be adversely affected by a decline in real estate values in its primary market area even if real estate values elsewhere in california remained stable or increased 
commercial loans 
commercial loans consist primarily of short term financing for businesses and professionals located in sonoma and mendocino counties 
at december   these loans totaled  or  of the company s total loans 
this represents an increase of  or from in commercial loans decreased  or from the commercial loans are diversified as to industries and types of businesses  with no material industry concentrations 
commercial loan borrowers generally have deposit relationships with the company 
the commercial loans can be unsecured or secured by various assets  including equipment  receivables  deposits and other assets 
commercial loans may be secured by commercial or residential property  however they are not classified as mortgage loans since these loans are not typically taken out for the purpose of acquiring real estate and the loans are short term 
in these cases  the mortgage collateral is often taken as additional collateral 
as of december   the size of individual commercial loans varied widely  with having principal balances less than  at december   the company had commercial borrowers whose aggregate individual liability exceeded  loan commitments 
in the normal course of business  there are various commitments outstanding to extend credit that are not reflected in the financial statements 
annual review of the commercial credit lines and ongoing monitoring of outstanding balances reduces the risk of loss associated with these commitments 
as of december   the company had outstanding  in unfunded mortgage loan commitments   in undisbursed loan commitments and  in standby letters of credit 
the company s undisbursed commercial loan commitments represented primarily business lines of credit 
the undisbursed construction commitments represented undisbursed funding on construction projects in process 
the mortgage loan commitments represented approved but unfunded mortgage loans with the company s mortgage banking business 
residential lending the company s results of operations has been substantially effected by residential lending activity  which can fluctuate significantly  in both volume and profitability  with changes in interest rates 
for  residential lending loan originations totaled million  or billion less than the billion originated in in mortgage loan originations were million more than the billion originated in the mix of these originations in was approximately fixed rate loans vs

year ended december  in millions mortgage banking loan originations  increase decrease from prior period mortgage banking loan sales  increase decrease from prior period mortgage banking revenue operating loss profit in thousands   all of the company s mortgage loans held for sale meet certain investor underwriting criteria regarding loan to value ratios  maturities  yields and related documentation 
the majority of the loans sold by the company have been sold to either fannie mae  freddie mac or other institutional mortgage conduits 
these loans must conform to established freddie mac fannie mae underwriting criteria  including a maximum dollar limit  maturities that vary from five to thirty years  loan to value ratios of or less or less with mortgage insurance  adequate borrower liquidity  and the ability of the borrower to service the mortgage debt and all other debt out of income 
loans sold to other investors  such as savings and loans  insurance companies and other conduits  usually are for dollar amounts in excess of the freddie mac fannie mae limit  but otherwise generally meet standard freddie mac fannie mae underwriting criteria 
as part of its residential lending activities  the company enters into forward commitments to sell mortgage loans  either in the form of mortgage backed securities mbs or as whole loans 
these commitments may be optional or mandatory 
under optional commitments  a commitment fee is paid and the company carries no risk in excess of the loss of such fee in the event that the company is unable to deliver sufficient mortgage loans to fulfill the commitment 
mandatory commitments may entail possible financial risk to the company if it is unable to deliver mortgage loans in sufficient quantity or at sufficient rates to meet the terms of the commitments 
in order to minimize the risk that a change in interest rates will result in a decrease in the value of the company s current mortgage loan inventory or its commitments to purchase or originate mortgage loans committed pipeline  the company enters into hedging transactions 
the company s hedging policies generally require that its inventory of mortgage loans held for sale and the maximum portion of its committed pipeline that may close be hedged with forward sales of mbs or options to buy or sell mortgage backed or us treasury securities 
as such  the company is not exposed to significant risk nor will it derive any significant benefit from changes in interest rates on the price of the mortgage loan inventory net of gains or losses of associated hedge positions 
the correlation between the price performance of the hedge instruments and the inventory being hedged is very high due to the similarity of the asset and the related hedge instrument 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that the portion of loans from the committed pipeline that actually closes at the committed price is less than the portion expected to close in the event of a decline in rates  and in the event such decline in closings is not covered by forward contracts and options to purchase mbs needed to replace the loans in process that do not close at their committed price 
the company determines the portion of its committed pipeline that it will hedge based on numerous factors  including the composition of the company s committed pipeline  the portion of such committed pipeline likely to close  the timing of such closings and the current interest rate environment 
the following lists the notional amounts of the various hedging instruments outstanding at december  and the date through which exercise dates extend exercise dates notional amount extend through in thousands forward contracts to sell mbs  january mortgage loan servicing 
mortgage loan servicing includes the collection and remittance of loan payments  accounting for principal and interest  holding escrow impound funds for payment of taxes and insurance  making inspections of the mortgage premises when required  collection of past due amounts from delinquent mortgagors  supervision of foreclosures in the event of unremedied defaults  and general administration of the loans  either for the company or for the investors to whom the loans have been sold 
the amounts of impound payments held by the company for others totaled   and  on december   and  respectively 
servicers of loans sold to freddie mac or fannie mae generally receive a loan servicing fee of at least 
per annum on the declining principal balance of the loans being serviced  but the actual fee can be higher depending upon the coupon rate of the loans being serviced and the actual pass through rate paid to the investor 
servicing fees for other investors can vary according to market conditions at the time the loan is sold 
in general  the value of the company s loan servicing portfolio may be adversely affected by declining mortgage interest rates and increasing loan prepayments 
income generated from the portfolio may also decline in such an environment 
in a low interest rate environment  the rate at which mortgage loans are prepaid tends to increase as borrowers refinance their loans 
a high level of prepayments for an extended period of time could have an adverse effect on the value of the company s pmsr pools  the level of the company s outstanding loan portfolio  and the size of its mortgage loan servicing portfolio 
additionally  the company s decision to sell servicing rights  and the timing of such sales  may affect the company s earnings on a quarter to quarter basis 
certain factors  including demand and prepayment  delinquency and foreclosure rates  could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to sell servicing rights and the value of those rights 
in a rising interest rate environment  prepayments of loans decrease and the value of the company s loan servicing portfolio will decline at a slower rate 
the following table sets forth the dollar amounts of the company s mortgage loan servicing portfolio at the dates indicated  the portion of the company s loan servicing portfolio resulting from loan originations and purchases and the carrying value as a percentage of loans serviced 
december  in thousands loans originated by the company and sold    loans underlying purchased mortgage servicing rights   total    purchased and originated mortgage servicing rights  purchased and originated mortgage servicing rights as a percentage of loans serviced 


management may from time to time determine to sell the company s mortgage loans on a servicing released basis based on market conditions 
the company sells loan servicing rights to offset the cost of originating mortgage loans 
the amount of loan servicing rights sold annually by the company may vary because of market fluctuations in the pricing of loan servicing rights  and the amount of gain upon sale of servicing rights may vary significantly from period to period 
in and  the company sold a portion of its originated servicing rights on a bulk basis for gains of  and  no such gains or losses were realized in the company also purchases mortgage servicing rights pmsr in order to better utilize its servicing capabilities and to take advantage of market prices which management believed to be favorable 
the amounts the company pays for the rights to service loans are carried on the company s statement of financial condition as intangible assets and are amortized in proportion to  and over the estimated life of  the related pools of mortgage loans using a method approximating the interest method 
the company s carrying values of purchased mortgage servicing rights  and the amortization thereon  are evaluated quarterly  by portfolios  and such carrying values are adjusted for indicated impairments based on management s best estimate of the remaining cash flows 
such estimates may vary from the actual remaining cash flows due to unanticipated prepayments of the underlying mortgage loans and increases in servicing costs 
the company s carrying values of purchased mortgage servicing rights do not purport to represent the amount that would be realizable by a sale of these assets in the open market 
the prepayment rates of the company s pmsr pools ranged between and during the company s omsr and pmsr amortization  including valuation adjustments  totaled  for   for and  for the amortized values of the company s pmsr pools were  and  at december  and  respectively

the company conducts its own internal credit review processes and  in addition  contracts with an independent loan reviewer who performs monthly reviews of new loans and potential problem loans that meet predetermined parameters 
the boards of directors of nbr has an internal asset review committee which reviews the asset quality of new and problem loans on a monthly basis and reports the findings to the full board 
in management s opinion  this loan review system facilitates the early identification of potential problem loans 
the performance of the company s loan portfolio is evaluated regularly by management 
the company places a loan on nonaccrual status when one of the following events occurs any installment of principal or interest is days or more past due unless  in management s opinion  the loan is well secured and in the process of collection  management determines the ultimate collection of principal of or interest on a loan to be unlikely  or the terms of a loan have been renegotiated to less than market rates due to a serious weakening of the borrower s financial condition 
with respect to the company s policy of placing loans days or more past due on nonaccrual status unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection  a loan is considered to be in the process of collection if  based on a probable specific event  it is expected that the loan will be repaid or brought current 
generally  this collection period would not exceed days 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  the company s general policy is to reverse and charge against current income previously accrued but unpaid interest 
interest income on such loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash is received and future collection of principal is deemed by management to be probable 
where the collectibility of the principal of or interest on a loan is considered to be doubtful by management  it is placed on nonaccrual status prior to becoming days delinquent 
on january   the company adopted sfas no 
accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosure 
these statements address the accounting and reporting by creditors for impairment of certain loans 
in general  a loan is impaired when  based upon current information and events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
these statements are applicable to all loans  uncollateralized as well as collateralized  except loans that are measured at the lower of cost or fair value 
impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  except that as a practical expedient  the company measures impairment based on a loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent

the effect of adopting sfas has not been material to the company s balance sheet or statement of operations 
interest income is recognized on impaired loans in a manner similar to that of all loans 
it is the company s policy to place loans that are delinquent days or more as to principal or interest on nonaccrual status unless secured and in the process of collection  and to reverse from current income accrued but uncollected interest 
cash payments subsequently received on nonaccrual loans are recognized as income only where the future collection of principal is considered by management to be probable

the average recorded investment in impaired loans during the year ended december  and was  and  the related amount of interest income recognized during the period that such loans were impaired was  and  no interest income was recognized using a cash basis method of accounting during the period that the loans were impaired

other assets owned were contract receivable rights and repossessed personal property carried at  in addition to the above mentioned assets  management of the company has identified approximately million in potential nonperforming loans  as to which it has serious doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present repayment terms and which may become nonperforming assets  based on known information about possible credit problems of the borrower 
the following table provides certain information for the years indicated with respect to the company s allowance for loan losses as well as charge off and recovery activity

allowance for loan losses to total loans allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans net charge offs increased by  to  in primarily due to  in charge offs related primarily to three separate borrowers 
the allowance for loan losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of the provision for loan losses 
loan losses are charged to  and recoveries are credited to  the allowance for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses is determined after considering various factors such as loan loss experience  current economic conditions  maturity of the portfolio  size of the portfolio  industry concentrations  borrower credit history  the existing allowance for loan losses  independent loan reviews  current charges and recoveries to the allowance for loan losses  and the overall quality of the portfolio  as determined by management  regulatory agencies  and independent credit review consultants retained by the company 
the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan losses is based on specific and formula allocations to the company s loan portfolio 
specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses are made to identified problem or potential problem loans 
the specific allocations are increased or decreased through management s reevaluation of the status of the particular problem loans 
loans which do not receive a specific allocation receive an allowance allocation based on a formula  represented by a percentage factor based on underlying collateral  type of loan  historical charge offs and general economic conditions  which is applied against the general portfolio segments 
it is the policy of management to make additions to the allowance for loan losses so that it remains adequate to cover anticipated charge offs  and management believes that the allowance at december  is adequate 
however  the determination of the amount of the allowance is judgmental and subject to economic conditions which cannot be predicted with certainty 
accordingly  the company cannot predict whether charge offs of loans in excess of the allowance may be required in future periods 
the provision for loan losses reflects an accrual sufficient to cover projected probable charge offs and the maintenance of the allowance at a level deemed adequate to absorb potential future losses 
the table below sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan type as of the dates specified 
the allocation of individual categories of loans includes amounts applicable to specifically identified as well as unidentified losses inherent in that segment of the loan portfolio and will necessarily change whenever management determines that the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio have changed 
management believes that any breakdown or allocation of the allowance for loan losses into loan categories lends an appearance of exactness which does not exist  in that the allowance is utilized as a single unallocated allowance available for all loans and undisbursed commitments 
the allocation below should not be interpreted as an indication of the specific amounts or loan categories in which future charge offs may occur

from time to time the company may be required to repurchase mortgage loans from investors depending upon representations and warranties of the purchase agreement between the investor and the company 
such representations and warranties include valid appraisal  status of borrower  first payment default or fraud 
primarily these repurchases involve loans which are in default 
the company expects that it may be required to repurchase loans in the future 
the company maintains a reserve for its estimate of potential losses associated with the potential repurchase of previously sold mortgage loans 
such reserve amounts to  as of december  liquidity redwood s primary source of liquidity is dividends from its financial institution subsidiary 
redwood s primary uses of liquidity are associated with cash payments made to the subordinated debt holders  dividend payments made to the preferred stock holders  and operating expenses 
it is the company s general policy to retain liquidity at the parent at a level which management believes to be consistent with the safety and soundness of the company as a whole 
as of december   redwood held  in deposits at its subsidiaries and a  subordinated note issued by nbr 
beginning with the fourth quarter of  redwood paid a quarterly dividend of 
per share of common stock 
in the fourth quarter of  this dividend was increased to 
per share 
in the fourth quarter of the dividend was suspended 
in addition  redwood pays quarterly dividends of on  of its preferred stock and interest at on  of subordinated debentures issued in payment of these obligations is dependent on dividends from nbr 
federal regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit the payment of dividends by nbr to redwood if a finding is made that such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice  or if nbr became undercapitalized 
if nbr is restricted from paying dividends  redwood could be unable to pay the above obligations 
no assurance can be given as to the ability of nbr to pay dividends to redwood 
during  nbr and allied declared dividends of  and  respectively 
during  nbr and allied declared dividends of  and  respectively 
in  nbr declared dividends of  management believes that at december  the company s liquidity position was adequate for the operations of redwood and its subsidiaries for the foreseeable future 
although each entity within the consolidated group manages its own liquidity  the company s consolidated cash flows can be divided into three distinct areas  operating  investing and financing 
for the year ended december  the company received  and  in cash flows from operations and investment activities while using  in financing activities  respectively 
the principal sources of asset liquidity are federal funds sold and loans held for sale 
secondary sources of liquidity are loan repayments  investments available for sale  maturing investments  and investments that can be used as collateral for other borrowings 
at december   the company had  in federal funds sold and  in loans held for sale 
total investments were  of which  were pledged 
time deposits from other financial institutions totaled million  or 
of total deposits  at december   a decrease of million from the million recorded at december   which amounted to of total deposits at that time 
these deposits are used to supplement liquidity when the company determines that deposits from local sources would be more expensive 
the company is able to retain such deposits at favorable rates when desired 
the volume of these deposits are dependent on anticipated mortgage origination volumes 
liability based liquidity includes interest bearing and noninterest bearing retail deposits  which are a relatively stable source of funds  time deposits from financial institutions throughout the united states  federal funds purchased  and other short term and long term borrowings  some of which are collateralized 
the company collateralized fhlb advances as nbr is a member of the fhlb 
management uses fhlb advances as part of its funding strategy because the rates paid for those advances are generally lower than the rates paid on deposits 
fhlb advances must be collateralized by the pledging of qualified mortgage loans of nbr 
nbr s fhlb borrowing limitation at december  was  compared to million at december  at december   allied had million in fhlb advances outstanding  as compared to  at december  as an integral part of its funding strategy  the company will consider alternatives to fhlb advances while seeking to increase its maximum borrowing limits from the fhlb as allied s total assets increase from time to time 
there is no assurance  however  that the company will be able to continue to obtain additional increases in its fhlb borrowing authority  or that the rates paid on such advances will be advantageous in the future 
if additional increases are not obtained  the company s cost of funds could increase  as the company may be required to raise interest rates offered on deposit programs in order to retain deposits in both the retail and wholesale markets to fund its mortgage banking operations 
capital a strong capital base is essential to the company s continued ability to service the needs of its customers 
capital protects depositors and the deposit insurance fund from potential losses and is a source of funds for the substantial investments necessary for the company to remain competitive 
in addition  adequate capital and earnings enable the company to gain access to the capital markets to supplement its internal growth of capital 
capital is generated internally primarily through earnings retention 
the company and nbr are each required to maintain minimum capital ratios defined by various federal government regulatory agencies 
the frb and the occ have each established capital guidelines  which include minimum capital requirements 
the regulations impose two sets of standards a risk based and leverage 
under the risk based capital standard  assets reported on an institution s balance sheet and certain off balance sheet items are assigned to risk categories  each of which is assigned a risk weight 
this standard characterizes an institution s capital as being tier capital defined as principally comprising shareholders equity and noncumulative preferred stock and tier capital defined as principally comprising the allowance for loan losses and subordinated debt 
at december   and  the company and its subsidiaries were required to maintain a total risk based capital ratio of  including a tier capital ratio of at least 
under the leverage capital standard  an institution must maintain a specified minimum ratio of tier capital to total assets  with the minimum ratio ranging from to 
the minimum leverage ratio for the company and nbr is based on average assets for the quarter 
nbr maintains insurance on its customer deposits with the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
the fdic manages the bank insurance fund bif  which insures deposits of commercial banks such as nbr  and the savings association insurance fund saif  which insures deposits of savings associations such as allied 
fdicia mandated that the two funds maintain reserves at of their respective federally insured deposits 
the table below shows the capital ratios for the company and nbr at december  company nbr total capital to risk based assets tier capital to risk based assets leverage ratio in addition to these capital guidelines  the federal deposit insurance act of required each federal banking agency to implement a regulatory framework for prompt corrective actions for insured depository institutions that are not adequately capitalized 
the fdic and occ have adopted regulations which became effective on december   implementing a system of prompt corrective action pursuant to section of the federal deposit insurance act and section of the fdic improvement act of the regulations establish five capital categories with the following characteristics total risk tier risk based capital based capital leverage ratio ratio ratio well capitalized the institution is at least at least at least not subject to an order  written agreement  capital directive or prompt corrective action directive adequately capitalized the at least at least at least institution does not meet the definition of a well capitalized institution undercapitalized the institution s less than less than less than capital level fails to meet the minimum levels significantly undercapitalized the less than less than less than institution s capital level is significantly below the minimum levels critically undercapitalized the institution has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets of or less the regulations established procedures for classification of financial institutions within the capital categories  filing and reviewing capital restoration plans required under the regulations and procedures for issuance of directives by the appropriate regulatory agency  among other matters 
the regulations impose restrictions upon all institutions to refrain from certain actions which would cause an institution to be classified within any of the three undercapitalized categories  such as the declaration of the dividends or other capital distributions or payment of management fees  if following the distribution or payment the institution would be classified within one of the undercapitalized categories 
in addition  institutions which are classified in one of the three undercapitalized categories are subject to certain mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions 
mandatory supervisory actions include increased monitoring and review by the appropriate federal banking agency  implementation of a capital restoration plan  total asset growth restrictions  and limitation upon acquisitions  branch expansion  and new business activities without prior approval of the appropriate federal banking agency 
discretionary supervisory actions may include requirements to segment capital  restriction upon affiliate transactions  restrictions upon deposit gathering activities and interest rates paid  replacement of senior executive officers and directors  restrictions upon activities of the institution and its affiliates  requiring divestiture or sale of the institution  and any other supervisory action that the appropriate federal banking agency determines is necessary to further the purpose of the regulations 
under the most stringent capital requirement  the company has approximately  in excess capital before it becomes under capitalized 
similarly  nbr has  in excess capital 
year the inability of computers  software and other equipment utilizing microprocessors to recognize and properly process data fields containing a two digit year is commonly referred to as the year compliance issue 
the company has purchased substantially all of its software applications from third party vendors under licensing arrangements 
these vendors  including vendors who sold and support the company s loan  deposit  and financial management processing software have indicated that their software is year compliant 
management believes that costs associated with year compliance is immaterial and the company s level of preparedness is appropriate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk as a financial institution  the company s primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuation in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of the bank s assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  other than those which possess a short term to maturity 
since virtually all of the company s interest bearing liabilities and all of the company s interest earning assets are located at the bank  virtually all of the company s interest rate risk exposure lies at the bank level 
as a result  all significant interest rate risk management procedures are performed at the bank level 
based upon the nature of its operations  the bank is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
the bank s real estate loan portfolio  concentrated primarily within northern california  is subject to risks associated with the local economy 
the company does not own any trading assets 
see asset quality 
the fundamental objective of the company s management of its assets and liabilities is to maximize the economic value of the company while maintaining adequate liquidity and an exposure to interest rate risk deemed by management to be acceptable 
management believes an acceptable degree of exposure to interest rate risk results from the management of assets and liabilities through maturities  pricing and mix to attempt to neutralize the potential impact of changes in market interest rates 
the bank s profitability is dependent to a large extent upon its net interest income  which is the difference between its interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and its interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
the bank  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest earning assets reprice differently than its interest bearing liabilities 
the bank manages its mix of assets and liabilities with the goals of limiting its exposure to interest rate risk  ensuring adequate liquidity  and coordinating its sources and uses of funds 
the bank seeks to control its interest rate risk exposure in a manner that will allow for adequate levels of earnings and capital over a range of possible interest rate environments 
the bank has adopted formal policies and practices to monitor and manage interest rate risk exposure 
as part of this effort  the bank measures risk in three ways repricing of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  changes in net interest income for interest rate shocks up and down basis points  and changes in the market value of equity for interest rate shocks up and down basis points 
the following table sets forth  as of december   the distribution of repricing opportunities for the company s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the interest rate sensitivity gap  the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap  the interest rate sensitivity gap ratio ie  earning assets divided by interest bearing liabilities and the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio 
after three after six after one within months but months but year but three within six within within after five months months one year five years years total dollars in thousands earning assets federal funds sold   investment securities and other      mortgage loans held for sale   loans       total earning assets       interest bearing liabilities interest bearing transaction accounts   time deposits      other borrowings   subordinated notes   total interest bearing liabilities       interest rate sensitivity gap       cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap      interest rate sensitivity gap ratio 

cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio 
the company s gap position is substantially dependent upon the volume of mortgage loans held for sale and held in the portfolio 
these loans generally have maturities greater than five years  however  mortgage loans held for sale are generally sold within to days of funding and therefore are classified in the above table as repricing within three months 
the company enters into commitments to sell such loans on a forward basis  usually within to days 
the amount of loans held for sale and the amount of forward commitments can fluctuate significantly from period to period 
additionally  interest bearing transaction accounts  which consist of money market  demand and savings deposit accounts  are classified as repricing within three months 
some of these deposits may be repriced at management s option  and therefore a decision not to reprice such deposits could significantly alter the company s net interest margin 
management expects that  in a declining rate environment  the company s net interest margin would be expected to decline  and  in an increasing rate environment  the company s net interest margin would tend to increase 
the company has experienced greater mortgage lending activity through mortgage refinancings and financing new home purchases as rates declined  and may increase its net interest margins in an increasing rate environment if more traditional commercial bank lending becomes a higher percentage of the overall earning assets mix 
there can be no assurance  however  that under such circumstances the company will experience the described relationships to declining or increasing interest rates 
on a monthly basis  nbr management prepares an analysis of interest rate risk exposure 
such analysis calculates the change in net interest income and the theoretical market value of the bank s equity given a change in general interest rates of basis points up and basis points down 
all changes are measured in dollars and are compared to projected net interest income and the current theoretical market value of the bank s equity 
this theoretical market value of the bank s equity is calculated by discounting cash flows associated with the company s assets and liabilities 
the following is a december  summary of interest rate risk exposure as measured on a net interest income basis and a market value of equity basis  given a change in general interest rates of basis points up and basis points down 
change in annual change in change in interest rate net interest income market value of equity the model utilized by management to create the report presented above makes various estimates at each level of interest rate change regarding cash flows from principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities and or call activity on investment securities 
in addition  repricing these earning assets and matured liabilities can occur in one of three ways the rate of interest to be paid on an asset or liability may adjust periodically based on an index  an asset  such as a mortgage loan  may amortize  permitting reinvestment of cash flows at the then prevailing interest rates  or an asset or liability may mature  at which time the proceeds can be reinvested at current market rate 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates which would result in significant differences in the calculated projected change
