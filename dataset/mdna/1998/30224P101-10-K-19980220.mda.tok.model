item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general extended stay america  inc was organized on january  as a delaware corporation to develop  own  and manage extended stay lodging facilities 
studio plus hotels  inc was formed in december and acquired through merger and exchange of sph common stock for partnership interests immediately prior to completion of the sph initial public offering in june all of the assets of studio plus  inc and the sph predecessor entities  which owned and operated studioplus tm extended stay facilities since the acquisition of the interests of the controlling stockholder or partner and affiliates of the sph predecessor entities was accounted for as if it were a pooling of interests 
on april   esa  merger sub  and sph consummated a merger pursuant to which sph was merged with and into merger sub and the  shares of sph common stock that were outstanding on the closing date were converted into  shares of esa s common stock and options to purchase  shares of sph common stock were converted into options to purchase  shares of common stock 
as a result of the merger  sph became a wholly owned subsidiary of esa 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the company give effect to the merger  which has been accounted for as a pooling of interests 
the company owns and operates three brands in the extended stay lodging market studioplus tm hotels  extended stayamerica efficiency studios  and crossland economy studiossm  each designed to appeal to different price points below per week 
all three brands offer the same core components a living sleeping area  a fully equipped kitchen or kitchenette  and a bathroom 
extended stay rooms are designed to compete in the economy category 
crossland rooms are typically smaller than extended stay rooms and are targeted for the budget category  while studioplus facilities serve the mid price category and generally feature larger guest rooms  an exercise room  and a swimming pool 
the following is a summary of the company s selected development and operational results for the years ended december    and year ended december  total facilities open at period end total facilities developed total facilities acquired average occupancy rate average weekly room rate average occupancy rates are determined by dividing the rooms occupied on a daily basis by the total number of rooms 
due to the company s rapid expansion  its overall average occupancy rate has been negatively impacted by the lower occupancy typically experienced during the pre stabilization period for newly opened facilities 
this negative impact on occupancy is expected to diminish as the ratio of new property openings during a period to total properties in operation at the end of that period decreases 
average weekly room rates are determined by dividing room revenue by the number of rooms occupied on a daily basis for the applicable period and multiplying by seven 
the average weekly room rates vary from standard room rates due primarily to i stays of less than one week  which are charged at a higher nightly rate  ii higher weekly rates for rooms that are larger than the standard rooms  and iii additional charges for more than one person per room 
future occupancy and room rates may be impacted by a number of factors  including the number and geographic location of new facilities as well as the season in which such facilities commence operations 
there can be no assurance that the foregoing occupancy and room rates can be maintained 
the following is a summary of the company s development status as of december   by brand 
the company expects to complete the construction of the facilities currently under construction generally within the next twelve months and to commence construction on the majority of the sites under option at various dates in the future 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will acquire the sites under option or complete construction within time periods historically experienced by the company 
the company s ability to complete development of sites under construction and under option may be materially impacted by various factors including zoning  permitting  and environmental issues  as well as weather induced construction delays

accordingly  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million in  which represented the write off of debt issuance costs associated with the mortgage facilities 
the company is currently negotiating to amend the credit facility to provide the company with a million revolving credit facility and million of term loan facilities the amended credit facility 
the company expects that at least million of the new term loan facilities will be drawn on the effective date of the amended credit facility the effective date 
of the remaining million  million may be borrowed until july  and up to million may be borrowed until september   declining by each month after the effective date 
in addition  the amended credit facility will permit  but not make available  amounts not borrowed above to be borrowed at any time after the effective date and also permit  but not make available  an additional million after january  amounts borrowed under the amended credit facility would mature beginning december  availability under the credit facility and the amended credit facility  is dependent upon the company satisfying certain financial ratios of debt and interest compared to property level ebitda for qualifying properties  less corporate operating expenses 
in no event  however  is availability under the credit facility and the amended credit facility less than million at any time 
under the credit facility and the amended credit facility  the company is required to repay indebtedness outstanding with the net cash proceeds from certain sales of assets  from issuances of debt or equity by the company  and from insurance recovery events subject to certain reinvestment rights 
the company is also required to repay indebtedness outstanding under the credit facility and the amended credit facility  annually in an amount equal to of the company s excess cash flow as defined in the credit facility 
amounts drawn under the credit facility and the amended credit facility  bear interest  at the company s option  at either a prime rate or a eurodollar rate as defined in the credit facility  plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin for the credit facility and the revolving loans and certain of the term loans under the amended credit facility is an annual rate which fluctuates based on the company s ratio of total debt to total ebitda and which is between and for prime rate loans and and for eurodollar rate loans 
if at least million of gross cash proceeds are received by the company on or before september  from the issuance of certain debt instruments including the notes described below or common stock  the applicable margin will be between 
and for prime rate loans and between and for eurodollar rate loans 
the applicable margin for the remaining term loans under the amended credit facility will be for prime rate loans and for eurodollar rate loans 
the company s obligations under the credit facility are and if established  its obligation under the amended credit facility would be guaranteed by each of the company s subsidiaries and secured by a first priority lien on the stock of the company s subsidiaries and substantially all of the assets of the company and its subsidiaries other than mortgages on the real property of the company s and its subsidiaries 
the credit facility contains and  if established  the amended credit facility would contain a number of covenants that limit  among other things  the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to incur debt  make investments  pay dividends  prepay other indebtedness  engage in transactions with affiliates  enter into sale leaseback transactions  create liens  make capital expenditures  acquire or dispose of assets  or engage in mergers or acquisitions 
in addition  the credit facility contains affirmative covenants that require  among other things  maintenance of corporate existence  compliance with laws  maintenance of properties and insurance  and the delivery of financial and other information 
the company is also required to comply with certain financial covenants  including a maximum leverage ratio  minimum interest coverage ratio  and maximum debt to capitalization ratio

the company is currently in the process of seeking to raise approximately of gross proceeds in an offering of senior subordinated notes the notes 
the notes are expected to mature in  pay interest semiannually in cash  be redeemable by the company after five years from the date of their issuance  be unsecured  and be subordinated to the credit facility and  if established  the amended credit facility 
the company intends to use a portion of the proceeds from the offering of the notes to reduce revolving loans under the credit facility or the amended credit facility and to use the remainder to expand its business by developing additional extended stay lodging facilities and for other general corporate purposes 
the company expects to continue to rapidly expand its operations 
the company had commitments to complete construction of additional extended stay properties with a total cost of approximately million at december  and expects to make capital expenditures totalling at least million in the company believes that the net proceeds from the note offering  together with cash on hand  cash flow from operations  and borrowings expected to be available under the amended credit facility  will provide sufficient funds for the company to expand its business as presently planned and to fund its operating expenses at least through early thereafter  the company expects it will require additional funding to continue its expansion as currently planned 
the timing and amount of financing needed will depend on a number of factors  including the number of properties the company constructs or acquires  the timing of such development  and the cash flow generated by its properties 
in the event that the capital markets provide favorable opportunities  the company s plans or assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate  or the foregoing sources of funds prove to be insufficient to fund the company s growth and operations or if the credit facility is not amended as contemplated  or if the company consummates acquisitions  the company may seek additional capital sooner than currently anticipated 
sources of financing may include public or private debt or equity financing 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available to the company or  if available  that it can be obtained on acceptable terms or within the limitations contained in the company s financing arrangements 
failure to obtain such financing could result in the delay or abandonment of some or all of the company s development and expansion plans and expenditures and could have a material adverse effect on the company 
impact of the year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
based on its recent assessment  management of the company does not anticipate that any significant modification or replacement of the company s software will be necessary for its computer systems to properly utilize dates beyond december  or that the company will incur significant operating expenses to make any such computer system improvements 
the company is not able to determine  however  whether any of its suppliers  lenders  or service providers will need to make any such software modifications or replacements or whether the failure to make such software corrections will have an effect on the company s operations or financial condition 
seasonality and inflation based upon the operating history of the company s facilities  management believes that extended stay lodging facilities are not as seasonal in nature as the overall lodging industry 
management does expect  however  that occupancy and revenues may be lower than average during the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year 
because many of the company s expenses do not fluctuate with occupancy  such declines in occupancy may cause fluctuations or decreases in the company s quarterly earnings 
the rate of inflation as measured by changes in the average consumer price index has not had a material effect on the revenue or operating results of the company during any of the periods presented 
there can be no assurance  however  that inflation will not affect future operating or construction costs
