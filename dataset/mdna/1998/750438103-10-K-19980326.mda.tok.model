advertising expense decreased  both in dollars and as a percentage of sales and operating revenues  in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this decrease over the prior year is primarily the result of reductions in incredible universe advertising in due to stores closed pursuant to the restructuring plan 
computer city had a substantial increase in vendor participation in its advertising campaigns in compared to somewhat offsetting these decreases was a slight dollar increase in advertising expense at radioshack to promote the sprint store within a store concept  which was launched in september radioshack advertising expense as a percentage of sales in remained constant with in  advertising dollars are expected to be comparable to  with the exception of the expenses associated with the prior year sprint marketing launch 
rent expense increased as a percentage of sales to in from in this increase is related to a decrease in the number of computer city and incredible universe stores which have lower rent expense as a percentage of sales than the company as a whole 
rent expense in dollars decreased in from due to incredible universe and computer city store closures pursuant to the restructuring plan 
rent expense for radioshack remained consistent with the prior year in dollars and decreased slightly as a percentage of sales

these increases were offset by additional restructuring expense of the million related to store closings pursuant to the store closure plan

provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate of for fiscal year  compared to an effective tax benefit of for the comparable period in fiscal year the fiscal effective tax rate differed from the fiscal effective tax rate primarily because the fiscal tax rate included foreign income taxes which were incurred on foreign income despite the overall loss incurred by the company 
fiscal compared with fiscal net sales and operating revenues consolidated net sales and operating revenues increased to  million in from  million in the increase was primarily attributable to two factors the addition of radioshack stores net of closures and computer city stores during and the incremental addition of a full year s revenue related to stores opened during whose total revenue reflected a partial year 
for the year ended december   the company showed a comparable store sales decline  which was the result of all divisions experiencing comparable sales declines during the year 
although radioshack same store sales declined less than  incredible universe was down and computer city was down 
these declines were indicative of the heightened level of competition within the industry and lower consumer demand which negatively impacted the consumer electronics industry as a whole 
this lower demand was primarily attributed to higher consumer debt levels and the lack of new products with significant technological advances

continuing computer city sales would have approximated of total sales  after giving effect to the store closure plan 
furthermore  the company s gross profit margin for calendar year  excluding stores in the closure plan and the fourth quarter lower of cost or market inventory impairment  would have approximated 
see provision for business restructuring below 
during  radioshack s gross margin was up slightly when compared to due to the relative stability of product mix as a percentage of overall sales from to excluding lower of cost or market writedowns associated with store closures  computer city s gross margin decreased slightly in due to competitive forces which existed in the computer retail industry and the lack of introduction in of new products with significant technological advances

commencing in  the company receives fees from an unrelated third party financier of its private label credit card portfolio balance for the generation of normal interest bearing accounts  and pays a fee for the generation of special purpose promotional accounts  such as zero interest for six months 
incredible universe and computer city utilized these promotions frequently in fiscal and the fees are classified as credit card fees in the accompanying sg a table above 
other sg a expenses  which include repair  maintenance  travel  and other miscellaneous expenses had  in total  remained relatively consistent between and of sales during and net interest income expense net interest expense was million for versus net interest income of million for the reversal to a net interest expense position in was primarily attributable to the sale of the company s private label credit card portfolios to a third party in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of see sale of credit operations below for further information 
interest expense grew from to as a result of the company s increased usage of short term borrowing facilities  including seasonal bank credit lines and commercial paper facilities  as excess funds from the sale of credit operations were fully utilized
