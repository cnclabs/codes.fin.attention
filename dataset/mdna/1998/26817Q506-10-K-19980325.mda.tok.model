in addition  short term interest rates increased during march  which raised the company s weighted average borrowing costs to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the overall yield on interest earning assets increased to for year ended december   from for the same period in this increase is primarily due to the arm assets in the company s portfolio resetting upwards during and the purchase of higher yielding arm residual trusts during the latter part of and during the first three quarters of individually  the net interest spread on collateralized bonds decreased basis points  from basis points for the year ended december  to basis points for the same period in this decline was primarily due to the securitization of lower coupon collateral  principally a quality single family arm loans during coupled with the prepayments of seasoned  higher coupon single family collateral during in addition  the spread on the net investment in collateralized bonds decreased due to higher premium amortization caused by increased prepayments during the latter part of the net interest spread on mortgage securities increased basis points  from basis points for the year ended december  to basis points for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributed to the arm securities in the company s portfolio during having a higher margin than those arm securities in the company s portfolio in in addition  the company purchased higher yielding arm residual trusts during the latter part of and during the first three quarters of the net interest spread on other investments increased basis points  from a negative basis points for the year ended december   to basis points for the year ended december   due primarily to lower borrowing costs associated with the company s single family model home purchase and leaseback business during the net interest spread on loans held for securitization decreased basis points  from basis points from the year ended december   to basis points for the same period in this decrease is primarily attributable to the purchase of lower coupon loans  principally a quality single family arm loans during compared to the increase in net interest spread for relative to is primarily the result of the increase in the spread on arm securities and an increase in the average balance and spread on the net investment in collateralized bonds  which for  constituted the largest portion of the company s investment portfolio on a weighted average basis

the company s overall weighted average borrowing costs decreased to for from for the overall yield on interest earning assets increased to from as the company s portfolio became more heavily weighted in collateral for collateralized bonds which have higher effective rates than arm securities

interest income and interest earning assets the company s average interest earning assets grew to billion during  an increase of from billion of average interest earning assets during this increase in average interest earnings assets was primarily the result of the addition of billion of collateral for collateralized bonds during of this amount  billion resulted from the pledge of arm securities already owned by the company as collateral for collateralized bonds 
this was offset by billion of principal paydowns on securities and loans during average interest earning assets increased to billion during  from billion during this increase in interest earnings assets from to was primarily a result of the addition of billion of collateral for collateralized bonds during  net of billion of principal paydowns on securities and loans during total interest income rose during  from million for the year ended december   to million for the same period of this increase in total interest income was due to the growth in average interest earning assets during total interest income also rose during from million for the year ended december  to million for the same period in overall  the yield on average interest earning assets rose to for the year ended december   from and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these increases resulted from increased yields on arm loans included in the company s investment portfolio for collateral for collateralized bonds  arm securities and arm residual trusts 
as indicated in the table below  the average yields were  and higher than the average daily six month libor interest rate during  and  respectively 
while a majority of the arm loans underlying the company s arm securities and collateral for collateralized bonds are indexed to and reset based upon the level of the london interbank offered rate libor for six month deposits six month libor  approximately one third are indexed to and reset based upon the level of the constant maturity treasury index cmt

funds to finance the investment portfolio are borrowed primarily in the form of collateralized bonds and repurchase agreements  both of which are primarily indexed to libor  principally one month libor 
the company may use interest rate swaps  caps and financial futures to manage its interest rate risk 
the net cost of these instruments is included in the cost of funds table below as a component of interest expense for the period to which it relates 
the company s average borrowed funds increased from billion during to billion during the increase resulted primarily from the issuance of billion of collateralized bonds during this increase was partially offset by a reduction of repurchase agreements primarily as a result of the company securitizing million of arm securities previously financed with repurchase agreements as collateral for collateralized bonds

interest rate agreements as part of the company s asset liability management process for its investment portfolio  the company enters into interest rate agreements such as interest rate caps  swaps and financial futures contracts 
these agreements are used to reduce interest rate risk which arises from the lifetime yield caps on the arm securities  the mismatched repricing of portfolio investments versus borrowed funds  and finally  assets repricing on indices such as the prime rate which differ from the related borrowing indices 
the agreements are designed to protect the portfolio s cash flow and to provide income and capital appreciation to the company in the event that short term interest rates rise quickly 
the following table includes all interest rate agreements in effect as of each year end for asset liability management of the investment portfolio 
interest rate agreements used by the company for asset liability management include interest rate swap  cap  futures and forward agreements and options on interest rate futures 
this table excludes all interest rate agreements in effect for the company s loan production operations 
generally  interest rate swaps and caps are used to manage the interest rate risk associated with assets that have periodic and annual interest rate reset limitations financed with borrowings that have no such limitations 
financial futures contracts and options on futures may be used to lengthen the terms of repurchase agreement financing  generally from one month to three and six months 
amounts presented are aggregate notional amounts

such amounts exclude the hedging costs and benefits associated with the company s production activities as these amounts are deferred as additional premium or discount on the loan funded and amortized over the life of the loan as an adjustment to its yield 
the net interest rate agreement expense declined slightly for the year ended december  compared to the same period in this slight decrease was the result of the amortization of existing interest rate agreements and no new interest rate agreements being entered into during the increase in the net interest rate agreement expense for compared to is primarily the result of the addition of an interest rate swap agreements to reduce the company s exposure to basis risk for certain collateral for collateralized bonds and to cap the borrowing costs during any six month period for a portion of the short term borrowings

this increase in the portfolio s value is primarily attributable to the increase in the value of the collateral for collateralized bonds relative to the collateralized bonds issued during all of the collateral pledged to secure collateralized bonds has been securitized  and  therefore  is considered to be debt securities according to statement of financial accounting standard no

year the year issue affects virtually all companies and organizations 
many companies have existing computer applications which use only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
these applications were designed and developed without considering the impact of the change of the century 
if not corrected these computer applications may fail or create erroneous results by the year the majority of the company s information critical systems have been developed internally since the development of these systems was undertaken with full awareness of issues involving the year  and consequently the company does not expect to encounter any significant year problems with these systems 
the company relies upon a small number of third party software vendors for certain information systems 
testing of these vendors systems is expected to be completed by the end of  and the company does not expect to see any significant impact to the operations supported by these vendors as a result of year problems 
the company does not expect that any expenses incurred as a result of any necessary modifications will be material to the results if operations 
liquidity and capital resources the company has various sources of cash flow upon which it relies for its working capital needs 
sources of cash flow from operations include primarily net interest margin and the return of principal on the portfolio of investments 
the company s primary source of borrowings is through the issuance of collateralized bonds 
other borrowings such as repurchase agreements and warehouse lines of credit provide the company with additional cash flow in the event that it is necessary 
historically  these sources have provided sufficient liquidity for the conduct of the company s operations 
however  if a significant decline in the market value of the company s investment portfolio that is funded with recourse debt should occur  the company s available liquidity from these other borrowings may be reduced 
as a result of such a reduction in liquidity  the company may be forced to sell certain investments in order to maintain liquidity 
if required  these sales could be made at prices lower than the carrying value of such assets  which could result in losses 
in order to grow its equity base  the company may issue additional capital stock 
management strives to issue such additional shares when it believes existing shareholders are likely to benefit from such offerings through higher earnings and dividends per share than as compared to the level of earnings and dividends the company would likely generate without such offerings 
during  the company issued  shares of its common stock pursuant to a registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission for net proceeds of million 
the company also issued  shares of its common stock during pursuant to its dividend reinvestment program for net proceeds of million 
the company borrows funds on a short term basis to support the accumulation of loans prior to the issuance of collateralized bonds 
these borrowings may bear fixed or variable interest rates  may require additional collateral in the event that the value of the existing collateral declines  and may be due on demand or upon the occurrence of certain events 
if borrowing costs are higher than the yields on the assets financed with such funds  the company s ability to acquire or fund additional assets may be substantially reduced and it may experience losses 
these short term borrowings consist of the company s lines of credit and repurchase agreements 
these borrowings are paid down as the company securitizes or sells loans 
a substantial portion of the assets of the company are pledged to secure indebtedness incurred by the company 
accordingly  those assets would not be available for distribution to any general creditors or the stockholders of the company in the event of the company s liquidation  except to the extent that the value of such assets exceeds the amount of the indebtedness they secure 
non recourse debt the company  through limited purpose finance subsidiaries  has issued non recourse debt in the form of collateralized bonds to fund its investment growth 
the obligations under the collateralized bonds are payable solely from the collateral for collateralized bonds and are otherwise non recourse to the company 
collateral for collateralized bonds are not subject to margin calls 
the maturity of each class is directly affected by the rate of principal prepayments on the related collateral 
each series is also subject to redemption according to specific terms of the respective indentures  generally when the remaining balance of the bonds equals or less of the original principal balance of the bonds 
at december   the company has billion of collateralized bonds outstanding as compared to billion at december  recourse debt secured 
at december   the company had three credit facilities aggregating million to finance loan fundings of which million expires in and million expires in one of these facilities includes several sublines aggregating million to serve various purposes  such as multifamily loan fundings  working capital  and manufactured housing loan fundings 
unsecured working capital borrowings under this facility are limited to million 
the company expects these credit facilities will be renewed  if necessary  at their respective expiration dates  although there can be no assurance of such renewal 
the lines of credit contain certain financial covenants which the company met as of december  however  changes in asset levels or results of operations could result in the violation of one or more covenants in the future 
at december   the company had million outstanding under its credit facilities 
the company finances a portion of its investments through repurchase agreements 
repurchase agreements allow the company to sell investments for cash together with a simultaneous agreement to repurchase the same investments on a specified date for a price which is equal to the original sales price plus an interest component 
at december   the company had outstanding obligations of million under such repurchase agreements compared to  million at december  increases in either short term interest rates or long term interest rates could negatively impact the valuation of mortgage securities and may limit the company s borrowing ability or cause various lenders to initiate margin calls for mortgage securities financed using repurchase agreements 
additionally  certain of the company s arm securities are aaa or aa rated classes that are subordinate to related aaa rated classes from the same series of securities 
such aaa or aa rated classes may have less liquidity than securities that are not subordinated and the value of such classes is more dependent on the credit rating of the related insurer or the credit performance of the underlying mortgage loans 
in instances of a downgrade of an insurer or the deterioration of the credit quality of the underlying mortgage collateral  the company may be required to sell certain investments in order to maintain liquidity 
if required  these sales could be made at prices lower than the carrying value of the assets  which could result in losses 
to reduce the company s exposure to changes in short term interest rates on its repurchase agreements  the company may lengthen the duration of its repurchase agreements secured by investments by entering into certain interest rate futures and or option contracts

fourth quarter review the company reported net income of million for the fourth quarter of and earnings per common share of 
these results were a slight decrease from the fourth quarter of net income of million and earnings per common share of 
compared with the fourth quarter of  the company s fourth quarter results reflect mainly an increase in the general and administrative expenses  offset partially by an increase in net interest margin 
net interest margin totaled million for the fourth quarter of compared with million for the fourth quarter of the increase resulted primarily from an increase in average interest earning assets to billion for the fourth quarter of compared to billion for the fourth quarter of the increase in the average interest earning assets was primarily due to the addition of billion in collateral for collateralized bonds during  net of billion of paydowns 
this increase in interest earnings assets was offset by the decline in the net interest spread on collateralized bonds which decreased from for the fourth quarter of to for the fourth quarter of this decline was primarily due to the securitization of lower coupon collateral  principally a quality single family arm loans during coupled with the prepayments of higher coupon collateral during the fourth quarter the spread on the net investment in collateralized bonds was also effected by higher premium amortization caused by the increased prepayments during the fourth quarter of these factors were the major contributors to the overall decrease in the net interest spread on all interest earning assets from in the fourth quarter of to for the fourth quarter of annualized return on common shareholders equity was in the fourth quarter of compared to for the fourth quarter of the average borrowed funds increased billion to billion for the fourth quarter of compared to billion for the fourth quarter of this increase was directly related to the increase in the average interest earning assets  primarily collateral for collateralized bonds

adjusted for two for one common stock split effective may  forward looking statements certain written statements in this form k made by the company  that are not historical fact constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
such forward looking statements may involve factors that could cause the actual results of the company to differ materially from historical results or from any results expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
the company cautions the public not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which may be based on assumptions and anticipated events that do not materialize 
the company does not undertake  and the securities litigation reform act specifically relieves the company from  any obligation to update any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause actual results to differ from historical results or from any results expressed or implied by forward looking statements include the following economic conditions 
the company is affected by consumer demand for manufactured housing  multifamily housing and other products which it finances 
a material decline in demand for these products and services would result in a reduction in the volume of loans originated by the company 
the risk of defaults and credit losses could increase during an economic slowdown or recession 
this could have an adverse effect on the company s financial performance and the performance on the company s securitized loan pools 
capital resources 
the company relies on various credit facilities and repurchase agreements with certain investment banking firms to help meet the company s short term funding needs 
the company believes that as these agreements expire  they will continue to be available or will be able to be replaced  however no assurance can be given as to such availability or the prospective terms and conditions of such agreements or replacements 
interest rate fluctuations 
the company s income depends on its ability to earn greater interest on its investments than the interest cost to finance these investments 
interest rates in the markets served by the company generally rise or fall with interest rates as a whole 
a majority of the loans currently originated by the company are fixed rate 
the profitability of a particular securitization may be reduced if interest rates increase substantially before these loans are securitized 
in addition  the majority of the investments held by the company are variable rate collateral for collateralized bonds and adjustable rate investments 
these investments are financed through non recourse long term collateralized bonds and recourse short term repurchase agreements 
the net interest spread for these investments could decrease during a period of rapidly rising short term interest rates  since the investments generally have periodic interest rate caps and the related borrowing have no such interest rate caps 
defaults 
defaults by borrowers on loans retained by the company may have an adverse impact on the company s financial performance  if actual credit losses differ materially from estimates made by the company at the time of securitization 
the allowance for losses is calculated on the basis of historical experience and management s best estimates 
actual defaults may differ from the company s estimate as a result of economic conditions 
actual defaults on arm loans may increase during a rising interest rate environment 
the company believes that its reserves are adequate for such risks 
prepayments 
prepayments by borrowers on loans securitized by the company may have an adverse impact on the company s financial performance 
prepayments are expected to increase during a declining interest rate or flat yield curve environment 
the company s exposure to rapid prepayments is primarily i the faster amortization of premium on the investments and  to the extent applicable  amortization of bond discount  and ii the replacement of investments in its portfolio with lower yield securities 
at december   the yield curve was considered flat relative to its normal shape  and as a result  the company expects some prepayment acceleration during the first six months in competition 
the financial services industry is a highly competitive market 
increased competition in the market could adversely affect the company s market share within the industry and hamper the company s efforts to expand its production sources 
regulatory changes 
the company s business is subject to federal and state regulation which  among other things require the company to maintain various licenses and qualifications and require specific disclosures to borrowers 
changes in existing laws and regulations or in the interpretation thereof  or the introduction of new laws and regulations  could adversely affect the company s operation and the performance of the company s securitized loan pools 
new production sources 
the company has expanded both its manufactured housing and commercial lending businesses 
the company is incurring or will incur expenditures related to the start up of these businesses  with no guarantee that production targets set by the company will be met or that these businesses will be profitable 
various factors such as economic conditions  interest rates  competition and the lack of the company s prior experience in these businesses could all impact these new production sources
