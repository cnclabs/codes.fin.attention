recent developments during the first quarter of the company developed a strategy to reduce debt and increase cash flows consisting of the following i implement a cost reduction plan which includes a significant reduction in nonessential staff and other consolidation synergy  heretofore not applied 
the aggregate reduction of these employee related expenses is expected to save approximately million annually  ii divest non core assets and focus upon the company s core business 
in addition to the mdi transaction described below  the company is currently reviewing other non core assets and will pursue other such sales as warranted  iii seek to refinance the company s long term debt  and iv once the first three steps have been accomplished  institute a sustained strategy of prudent acquisitions and new center development 
on march   the company entered into a definitive agreement to sell certain non core assets  specifically the company s mobile subsidiary medical diagnostics  inc mdi to alliance imaging inc

mobile imaging operations do not conform with the company s core business of fixed site mri and mutimodality imaging centers 
in the year ended december   the company recorded a non cash impairment charge of million 
the majority of acquired businesses and imaging centers which comprise the company were purchased in therefore was the first year of uninterrupted operation for such acquired entities as a part of the company s consolidated group 
during  current management became aware that many of the acquired centers were not performing as originally projected 
at year end all acquired businesses were analyzed in depth  in light of the additional operating data during the period of the company s ownership  to determine whether such shortfalls in performance were of a temporary nature and if current and expected future operating income would be sufficient to cover annual amortization of intangible and long lived assets acquired 
management has recorded impairment losses for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of those centers for which the sum of the expected cash flows does not cover the carrying value of the assets acquired 
management is currently investigating the causes of such performance shortfalls including  in some cases  to what extent the impairment losses are a result of misrepresentations by sellers

liquidity and capital resources for information regarding the company s credit facilities and certain contingencies related thereto  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company had working capital of million  compared to million at december  the increase was primarily due to borrowings under the company s credit facilities

in addition  cash balances were negatively affected by an increase in bad debt expense and accounts receivable resulting from a failure to fully collect receivables from third party payors  in part as a function of the company s conversion to a new centralized billing and collection system and in part  as a function of inefficiencies in realizing on the collection of patient copayments and deductible payments 
this reduction in cash balances has continued during the first quarter of and in response  the company has devoted additional resources to the collection of accounts receivable and implemented intense remedial efforts with respect thereto 
the company has also identified the strategy described above  including the sale of mdi  as well as the potential sale of other non core assets 
see overview and recent developments 
if the company s strategy is not sufficient or if collections cannot be improved to the extent necessary  the company s liquidity and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  if the uncertainties with respect to the company s credit facilities described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements cannot be satisfactorily resolved  the company may be required to pay down or refinance all or a portion of such credit facilities 
in any such event the company would likely need to seek new financing  either through an equity offering  additional borrowings or asset sales 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to obtain such new financing or effect such asset sales in a timely fashion or upon acceptable terms  or if at all

computer technologies and year compliance the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the year approaches 
many existing computer programs use only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
the issue is whether such code exists in the company s mission critical applications and if that code will produce accurate information with relation to date sensitive calculations after the turn of the century 
the company has completed a thorough review of its material computer applications 
in  the company began installing a new million state of the art billing and collection system as well as a new accounting system 
these new systems are year compliant 
there are many facility systems acquired by the company as a result of its acquisitions which may not be year compliant 
however  the company anticipates that all such systems will be replaced by its new systems before the year the company has received written confirmation from its vendors that its new systems are currently year compliant or will be made year compliant before year the cost to be incurred by the company relating to the year compliance for these systems is currently not expected to be material 
the company has initiated a program to determine whether the computer applications of its significant payors and suppliers will be upgraded in a timely manner 
the company has also initiated a program to determine whether embedded applications which control certain medical and other equipment will be affected 
the company has not yet completed these reviews 
the nature of the company s business is such that any failure to these types of applications may have a material adverse effect on its business 
because of the many uncertainties associated with year compliance issues  and because the company s assessment is necessarily based on information from third party vendors  payors and suppliers  there can be no assurance that the company s assessment is correct or as to the materiality or effect of any failure of such assessment to be correct
