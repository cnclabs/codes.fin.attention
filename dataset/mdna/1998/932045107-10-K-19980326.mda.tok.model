item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations overview the company s results of operations have historically varied substantially from quarter to quarter  and the company expects that they will continue to do so 
the timing and amount of the company s quarterly net revenues depend on a number of factors  such as the size and timing of customer orders or license agreements  the timing of the introduction and customer acceptance of new products or product enhancements by the company or its competitors  changes in pc operating systems introduced by microsoft  ibm or other companies  changes in pricing policies by the company or its competitors  product returns or rotations  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  customers postponing purchases of software products while they find year fixes and changes in general economic conditions 
net revenues will also depend upon the success of the company s recently announced cyberprise strategy 
products generally are shipped as orders are received and  accordingly  the company historically has operated with little or no backlog 
in addition  the company s operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term and a significant portion of the revenues for each quarter typically is received near the end of the quarter 
as a result  variations in timing of revenues can cause significant variations in quarterly results of operations 
the company has developed plans to address issues related to the impact on its products and systems of the year products have been modified  financial and operational systems have been assessed and plans have been developed to address modification requirements 
the financial impact of making the required changes is not expected to be material to the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  if the company or its vendors or distributors are unable to resolve such issues in a timely manner or if the company s products are used in conjunction with the software of other suppliers that have not adequately addressed year issues  it could result in a material financial risk 
accordingly  the company plans to devote the necessary resources to resolve all significant year issues in a timely manner 
the growth in net revenues and operating income experienced by the company during the past five years is not necessarily indicative of future results 
in view of the significant growth of the company s operations in recent years  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance 
the company s business is seasonal  with a substantial percentage of its annual net revenues and operating income typically occurring in the fourth quarter of the year 
since  the company has frequently incurred higher operating expenses in each sequential quarter primarily due to an increase in the number of employees 
the company expects that in the first quarter of lower net revenues  as compared to the fourth quarter of  will result in significantly lower net income
