factors affecting future operating results from time to time  information provided by the company  statements made by its employees or information included in its filings with the securities and exchange commission including statements in this form k may contain statements which are not historical facts  so called forward looking statements  and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provision of the private securities litigation reform act of and releases of the securities and exchange commission 
in particular  certain statements contained in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which are not historical facts including  but not limited to  statements concerning anticipated availability of capital for working capital and for capital expenditures constitute forward looking statements 
the company s actual future results may differ significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below and the other risks discussed in the company s prospectuses dated april  and october  included in its registration statements on form s reg 
nos 
and  respectively and from time to time in the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
supply and manufacturing risks the company currently relies on three outside foundries to supply fully processed semiconductor wafers 
there are significant risks associated with reliance on outside foundries  including the lack of assured wafer supply and control over delivery schedules  the unavailability of or delays in obtaining access to key process technologies and limited control over quality assurance  manufacturing yields and production costs 
the company is also subject to significant manufacturing risks including yield variances which the company or its outside foundries may experience 
intellectual property rights the company relies on certain intellectual property protections to preserve its intellectual property rights 
any invalidation of these intellectual property rights or lengthy and expensive defense of these rights could have a material adverse effect on the company 
dependence on new products the company s success will depend upon its ability to develop new semiconductor devices for existing and new markets  to introduce such products in a timely manner and to have such products selected for design into new products of its customers 
successful product development and introduction depends on a number of factors  including accurate new product definition  timely completion and introduction of new product designs  availability of foundry capacity  achievement of manufacturing yields and market acceptance of the company s and its customers products 
competition  the semiconductor industry the company competes with several domestic semiconductor companies  most of which have substantially greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing  distribution and other resources and broader product lines than the company 
the company believes that its ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including the breadth of its product line  the ability to develop and introduce new products rapidly  product innovation  product quality and reliability  product performance  price  technical service and support  adequacy of manufacturing quality and capacity and sources of raw materials  efficiency of production  delivery capabilities and protection of the company s products by intellectual property laws 
the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical and is subject to significant economic downturns at various times  characterized by diminished product demand  accelerated erosion of average selling prices and production over capacity 
the company may experience substantial period to period fluctuation in future operating results due to general semiconductor industry conditions and overall economic conditions 
international sales the company derives a significant portion of its net sales from international sales  including asia  which are subject to certain risks  including unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements  changes in tariffs  exchange rates and other barriers  political and economic instability  difficulties in accounts receivable collection  difficulties in managing distributors or representatives  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  difficulties in protecting the company s intellectual property overseas  seasonality of sales and potentially adverse tax consequences 
there can be no assurance that recent economic troubles in certain asian countries will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
potential fluctuations in operating results the company s quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially and adversely affect net sales and profitability from period to period  including competitive pressures on selling prices  the timing and cancellation of customer orders  availability of foundry capacity and raw materials  fluctuations in yields  changes in product mix  the company s ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis  introduction of products and technologies by the company s competitors  market acceptance of the company s and its customers products  the level of orders received which can be shipped in a quarter  the timing of investments in research and development  including tooling expenses associated with product development  process improvements and production  and the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry 
due to the absence of substantial noncancellable backlog  the company typically plans its production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
because the company is continuing to increase its operating expenses for personnel and new product development and for inventory in anticipation of increasing sales levels  operating results would be adversely affected if increased sales are not achieved 
in addition  the company is limited in its ability to reduce costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
as a result of the foregoing or other factors  the company may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect its business  financial condition and operating results 
historically  the company has also experienced quarterly fluctuations in net sales and gross profit  principally arising from the amount and timing of orders of products for military applications 
these sales generally result in lower gross margins than sales of commercial products 
the company anticipates a continuing decline in sales of products for military applications as part of its transition from a supplier of product with military applications to a supplier of commercial products 
should sales of these products decline more rapidly than the company anticipates in the near future  such decline could have the effect of causing further fluctuations in quarterly or annual operating results 
stock price volatility the trading price of the company s common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  general conditions in the semiconductor manufacturing and electronic markets  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  or other events or factors 
in addition  the public stock markets have experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility in recent months 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
year issue the company has recently commenced a year date conversion project to assess the possible impact of year issues on its business 
the company is looking at a its internal information and operating systems  b possible effects on the company of third parties failure to fix their own year issues  and c whether any material contingencies may exist related to products sold by the company 
the company expects that these assessments will enable it to develop plans for any required changes  testing and implementation  to make estimates of likely time involved  and costs of any required changes  and to determine whether year issues are likely to have a material impact on future financial results or financial condition
