item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations restructuring of natural gas industry the company s principal operating subsidiary  pg energy inc pg energy  and pg energy s wholly owned subsidiary  honesdale gas company honesdale collectively referred to as the regulated subsidiaries  are regulated public utilities engaged in the sale and distribution of natural gas which accounted for approximately of the company s operating revenues in the natural gas industry  which historically has included producers  interstate pipelines and local distribution companies ldcs  is undergoing significant restructuring 
the industry is rapidly progressing from a highly regulated environment to one in which there is competition  customer choice and only partial regulation 
the same change is also beginning to occur in the electric industry which competes with the natural gas industry for many of the same energy uses 
the restructuring of the natural gas industry has already involved the decontrol of the wellhead price of natural gas  and interstate pipelines have been required by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc to separate the merchant function of selling natural gas from the transportation and storage services they provide frequently referred to as unbundling and to make those services available to end users on the same terms as ldcs 
these changes in the operations of the interstate pipelines were designed to enhance competition and maximize the benefits of wellhead price decontrol 
as a result of actions by ferc  the interstate pipelines now primarily provide transportation and storage services  and ldcs  such as pg energy  are presently responsible for the procurement of competitively priced gas supplies and arranging for the appropriate transportation capacity and storage services with the interstate pipelines 
additionally  in accordance with regulations promulgated by the pennsylvania public utility commission the ppuc  pg energy currently offers transportation service to certain customers 
prior to the unbundling of services by the interstate pipelines and those services being made available to end users as well as ldcs  and until the ppuc adopted regulations providing for the transportation of natural gas  pg energy charged all its customers bundled rates 
these rates included a commodity charge based on the cost  as approved by ferc  which pg energy paid the pipelines for natural gas delivered to the entry point on its distribution system 
except for the approximately customers currently receiving transportation service  pg energy s customers continue to be charged bundled rates as approved by the ppuc  which include a commodity charge based on the costs prudently incurred by pg energy for the purchase of natural gas and for interstate pipeline transportation capacity and storage services 
customers receiving transportation service  which accounted for approximately of pg energy s total gas deliveries in  are charged rates approved by the ppuc  which exclude the commodity cost that is reflected in the bundled rates charged to other customers 
although the regulations promulgated by the ppuc only require ldcs to offer transportation service to individual customers having an annual consumption of at least  thousand cubic feet mcf of natural gas and groups of not more than ten customers having a combined consumption of at least  mcf per year  the ppuc has allowed certain ldcs to make transportation service available to other customers  regardless of their consumption 
one of these companies is honesdale which  with the approval of the ppuc  began offering transportation service to all of its some  customers effective november  as of february   approximately  of honesdale s customers had elected to receive transportation service and to purchase their natural gas supplies from pg energy services inc energy services  a subsidiary of the company and the only marketer currently selling gas to customers served by honesdale 
pg energy is also planning to file tariffs with the ppuc in the near future seeking approval to make transportation service available to all of its  customers 
moreover  as noted below  the company and pg energy currently believe that pennsylvania may enact legislation in requiring that all customers of ldcs have the right  within the next several years  to receive transportation service and to choose the supplier of their natural gas 
in december   legislation was enacted in pennsylvania which provides all customers of electric utilities in the state with the right to choose the generator of their electricity 
this customer choice  which is intended to increase competition and to lower costs for electricity  is being phased in over a three year period ending on january  under this legislation  the electric utilities in pennsylvania are required to unbundle generation charges from the other charges included in their currently bundled rates and customers can contract with qualified suppliers of their choosing  including the utility currently serving them  to purchase electric energy at nonregulated rates 
the electric utilities will continue to utilize their transmission and distribution networks to distribute electricity to their customers regardless of supplier  a function which will remain subject to rate regulation by the ppuc 
the company and pg energy believe that pennsylvania may enact similar legislation with respect to the natural gas industry in as currently envisioned  such legislation would require that pg energy provide all of its customers with unbundled transportation service within one to two years 
while the rates for the transportation of natural gas through pg energy s distribution system and the storage services offered by pg energy would continue to be price regulated by the ppuc  the commodity cost of gas purchased from suppliers other than pg energy would not be so regulated 
customers could  however  continue to receive a bundled sales service from pg energy which would be subject to price regulation by the ppuc 
essentially  the legislation would extend the transportation service which is now available to a limited number of pg energy s customers to all its customers  and customers could choose to have their natural gas provided by a supplier other than pg energy  based on nonregulated market prices and other considerations 
if pennsylvania enacts legislation which permits all customers of ldcs to choose their supplier of natural gas  pg energy will be faced with significant competition from marketers and brokers for the sale of natural gas to its customers 
however  under current regulations of the ppuc  pg energy does not realize a profit or incur any loss with respect to the commodity cost of natural gas 
moreover  pg energy would not expect the pending legislation to result in the bypass of its distribution system by any significant number of customers because of the nature of its customer base and the cost of any such bypass 
additionally  based on various provisions of the legislation currently being considered  pg energy does not believe that the legislation will result in any significant amount of transition costs such as the negotiated buyout of contracts with interstate pipelines  the recovery of deferred purchased gas costs or the recovery of regulated assets 
further  pg energy believes that any transition costs it may incur would generally be recoverable through rates or other customer charges 
accordingly  although it cannot be certain  because the terms of such legislation have not been finalized and the ultimate effect on pg energy cannot be determined  pg energy does not believe that the enactment of legislation providing for customers to purchase their natural gas from third parties would have any material adverse impact on its earnings or financial condition despite the increased competition to which pg energy would be subject regarding the sale of natural gas to its customers 
expansion of nonregulated activities the company intends to continue its focus to position its nonregulated subsidiaries as leading suppliers of energy and energy related products and services 
the regulated subsidiaries will actively market the use of natural gas and will continue to aggressively add customers to their distribution system 
additionally  the company plans to further expand the activities of energy services  a nonregulated affiliate of pg energy 
energy services  in alliance with cng energy services  markets a broad array of energy and energy related products and services under the name pg energy powerplus 
presently  pg energy powerplus offers the marketing and sale of natural gas and electricity to residential  commercial and industrial users  as well as the sale of propane on both a retail and wholesale level  in central and northeastern pennsylvania  and the inspection  maintenance and servicing of residential and small commercial gas fired equipment 
also  energy services  through its subsidiary  keystone pipeline services  inc keystone  provides specialized pipeline distribution services for utilities  including keyhole vacuum excavation  camera inspection and bridge pipeline rehabilitation  as well as the conventional installation of mains and services for the natural gas  water and sewer industries 
in addition  the company  through its subsidiary theta land corporation theta  is presently marketing company owned land parcels for residential and commercial development under the guidance of the watershed land use plan developed by the independent pg energy land use committee in association with the company 
theta is also developing plans to conduct timber  sand and gravel operations on the company s land and to increase the value being realized from the company s extensive land holdings through a more active management of those resources 
commencing in mid  pei power corporation power corp  a subsidiary of the company formed in october   expects to begin generating and selling electricity and steam produced by a cogeneration facility it acquired in november  the facility initially will be fueled by a combination of natural gas and methane recovered from a nearby landfill 
the output produced by this megawatt facility is intended to be marketed by pg energy powerplus

rate matters rate increase 
by order adopted december   the ppuc approved an overall increase in pg energy s base gas rates  designed to produce million of additional annual revenue  effective january  under the terms of the order  the billing for the impact of the rate increase relative to pg energy s residential heating customers  which totaled million through june   was deferred  without carrying charges  until july  gas cost adjustments 
the provisions of the pennsylvania public utility code require that the tariffs of ldcs be adjusted on an annual basis  and  in the case of larger ldcs such as pg energy  on an interim basis when circumstances dictate  to reflect changes in their purchased gas costs 
the procedure includes a process for the reconciliation of actual gas costs incurred and actual revenues received and also provides for the refund of any overcollections  plus interest thereon  or the recoupment of any undercollections of gas costs 
in accordance with these procedures pg energy has been permitted to make the following changes since january   to the gas costs contained in its tariff rates

march   december   march   december   september   june   december   may   represents estimated reduction in revenue for the period may   through november  the changes in gas rates on account of purchased gas costs have no effect on earnings since the change in revenue is offset by a corresponding change in the cost of gas 
effects of inflation 
when utility property reaches the end of its useful life and must be replaced  the company will incur replacement costs in amounts that due to the effects of inflation would materially exceed either the original cost or the accrued depreciation of such property as reflected on its books of account 
however  the cost of such replacement property would be includable in rate base  and the company would be entitled to recover depreciation expense and earn a return thereon  to the extent that its investment in such property was prudently incurred and the property is used and useful in furnishing public utility service 
liquidity and capital resources sale of water utility operations on february   pg energy sold its regulated water operations and certain related assets to pennsylvania american for million  consisting of million in cash and the assumption of million of pg energy s liabilities  including million of its long term debt 
the company and pg energy used the million of cash proceeds from the sale  net of million of income taxes  to retire debt  to repurchase stock  for construction expenditures and for other working capital purposes 
in this regard  pg energy repaid its million term loan due and all of its then outstanding bank borrowings on february   and the company and pg energy temporarily invested the balance of the proceeds 
a portion of these proceeds were subsequently used by the company to repurchase  shares of its common stock during for an aggregate consideration of million  of which  shares were acquired in april pursuant to a self tender offer and  shares were acquired from time to time through open market transactions and an oddlot buyback program 
also during and using proceeds from the sale  pg energy repurchased  shares of its cumulative preferred stock for an aggregate consideration of million and  shares of its cumulative preferred stock for an aggregate consideration of million  largely pursuant to self tender offers conducted during march and april   and utilized approximately million for its working capital needs 
additionally  on june   pg energy repurchased  shares of its cumulative preferred stock including shares redeemed in accordance with annual sinking fund provisions for an aggregate consideration of  liquidity the primary capital needs of the company continue to be the funding of pg energy s construction program and the seasonal funding of pg energy s gas purchases and increases in its customer accounts receivable 
pg energy s revenues are highly seasonal and weather sensitive  with approximately of its revenues normally being realized in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year when the temperatures in its service area are the coldest 
additionally  as the company s nonregulated activities expand  increased capital will be required for those activities  especially to convert the cogeneration facility power corp acquired in november   to burn both natural and methane gas and  in connection therewith  to construct a methane gas recovery facility at a nearby landfill 
it is currently anticipated that the expenditures for the expansion of the company s nonregulated activities will be funded by a combination of capital provided by the company  bank borrowings and other debt financing 
the cash flow from pg energy s operations is generally sufficient to fund a portion of its construction expenditures 
however  to the extent external financing is required  it is the practice of pg energy to use bank borrowings to fund such expenditures  pending the periodic issuance of stock and long term debt 
bank borrowings are also used by pg energy for the seasonal funding of its gas purchases and increases in customer accounts receivable 
in order to temporarily finance construction expenditures and to meet its seasonal borrowing requirements  pg energy has made arrangements for a total of million of unsecured revolving bank credit  which is deemed adequate for its immediate needs 
specifically  pg energy currently has seven bank lines of credit with an aggregate borrowing capacity of million which provide for borrowings at interest rates generally less than prime and which mature at various times during and and which pg energy intends to renew or replace as they expire 
as of february   pg energy had million of borrowings outstanding under these bank lines of credit 
the company believes that the regulated subsidiaries will be able to raise in a timely manner such funds as are required for their future construction expenditures  refinancings and other working capital requirements 
likewise  the company believes that its nonregulated subsidiaries will be able to raise such funds as are required for their needs  including that required relative to power corp s cogeneration facility and related methane gas recovery facility 
long term debt and capital stock financings both the company and its subsidiaries  most notably pg energy  periodically engage in long term debt and capital stock financings in order to obtain funds required for construction expenditures  the refinancing of existing debt and various working capital purposes 
set forth below is a summary of such financings consummated since the beginning of  exclusive of interim bank borrowings 
on september   pg energy borrowed million pursuant to a five year term loan agreement dated august  the term loan agreement  which matures on august  borrowings under the term loan agreement bear interest at libor london interbank offered rates plus one quarter of one percent as of february  
under the terms of the term loan agreement  pg energy can choose interest rate periods of one  two  three or six months 
pg energy utilized the proceeds from such loan to repay million of its bank borrowings 
on september   pg energy issued million of its senior notes due september  the senior notes 
the proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes were used by pg energy to repay million of its bank borrowings 
under the terms of its customer stock purchase plan the customer plan  which then provided the residential customers of pg energy with a method of purchasing newly issued shares of the company s common stock at a discount from the market price   shares million of the company s common stock were issued in effective may   the company suspended the customer plan because of the significant reduction in its capital requirements resulting from the sale of pg energy s water utility operations to pennsylvania american and because of the proceeds received from such sale 
however  based on its currently anticipated funding requirements and in order to help maintain an appropriate capital structure  the company reinstated the customer plan effective february  upon such reinstatement  the customer plan was amended to provide the residential customers of all the company s subsidiaries  including pg energy  with a method of purchasing newly issued shares of the company s common stock at a discount from the market price 
the company also obtains funds from the sale of common stock through its dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan the drp  its stock option plan and its employees savings plan 
effective may   the company suspended the supplemental cash investment feature of the drp and the discount from the market price on the reinvestment of dividends under the drp because of the significant reduction in its capital requirements resulting from the sale of pg energy s water utility operations to pennsylvania american and because of the proceeds received from such sale 
the supplemental cash investment feature was  however  reinstated effective june  additionally  from june   through december   the company temporarily suspended the sale of newly issued stock to both the drp and employees savings plan as a result of the proceeds received from the sale of pg energy s water utility operations  and during that period the two plans obtained shares of company common stock for participants through open market purchases 
effective january   the company resumed selling newly issued stock to both the drp and employees savings plan 
on january   the drp was amended to reinstate the provision whereby the company s shareholders may reinvest cash dividends and make supplemental cash investments to purchase newly issued shares of the company s common stock at a discount from the market price 
under the drp   shares million   shares  and  shares million of common stock were issued during  and  respectively 
under the company s employees savings plan a section k plan which became effective january   the company issued an additional  shares  in   shares  in and  shares  in additionally  under the company s stock option plan  shares   shares  and  shares  were issued in  and  respectively 
capital expenditures and related financings capital expenditures totaled million during  including million of expenditures for the construction of utility plant 
during and  respectively  expenditures for the construction of utility plant totaled million and million 
such expenditures were financed with internally generated funds and bank borrowings  pending the periodic issuance of stock and long term debt 
the company estimates that its capital expenditures will total million during  consisting of million relative to utility plant and million with respect to the company s nonregulated activities  including million to convert the cogeneration facility acquired by power corp in november   to burn both natural and methane gas and  in connection therewith  to construct a methane gas recovery facility at a nearby landfill 
capital expenditures are currently expected to range from million in each of the years and  of which approximately million per year will involve utility plant and the balance will relate to the company s nonregulated activities 
it is anticipated that such capital expenditures will be financed with internally generated funds and bank borrowings  and by the periodic issuance of stock and long term debt 
current maturities of long term debt and preferred stock as of december   million of pg energy s long term debt  and  of pg energy s preferred stock was required to be repaid within twelve months 
on september   the company defeased the million outstanding principal amount of its senior notes  due june  the senior notes 
specifically  on that date  the company deposited million with the trustee for the senior notes  which was used  together with interest earned on the funds so deposited  to pay the company s interest and principal obligations through june   the date on which the senior notes were scheduled to be redeemed 
the deposit of such funds acted to discharge all of the company s obligations with respect to the senior notes 
of the million required to defease the senior notes  million was obtained through the liquidation of the company s temporary cash investments and million was obtained through the repayment of loans that had been made by the company to pg energy
