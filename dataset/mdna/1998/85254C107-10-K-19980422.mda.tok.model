the company securitizes substantially all of its trade accounts receivables through srpc  a wholly owned special purpose entity 
srpc holds a retained interest in the securitization vehicle  a special purpose trust the trust which is represented by the retained certificates 
the company transfers  on a daily basis  substantially all of the accounts receivable generated from purchases by the holders of the company s proprietary credit card to srpc 
srpc is a separate limited purpose subsidiary that is operated in a manner intended to ensure that its assets and liabilities are distinct from those of the company and its other affiliates as srpc s creditors have a claim on its assets prior to such assets becoming available to any creditor of the company 
srpc transfers  on a daily basis  the accounts receivable purchased from the company to the trust in exchange for cash or an increase in the retained certificates 
the remaining interest in the trust is held by third party investors which are represented by the trust certificates 
since its inception  the trust has issued million of term certificates and a revolving certificate collectively  the trust certificates to third parties representing undivided interests in the trust 
prior to the fourth quarter of  the old revolving certificate was held by a bank which agreed to purchase interest in the trust equal to the amount of accounts receivable in the trust above the level required to support the term certificates  up to a maximum of million

amounts outstanding under the revolving certificate are funded by the issuance of commercial paper in the open market through a facility agent at various rates and maturities 
if the commercial paper market is unavailable  amounts outstanding under the revolving certificate would be funded by a liquidity provider 
the revolving certificate is a more efficient asset backed commercial facility which has terms and rates more favorable than the old revolving certificate 
the larger facility will allow the company to take advantage of the increase in accounts receivable in the trust as a result of the acquisition of cr anthony as well as to accommodate planned future growth

srpc receives distributions from the trust of cash in excess of amounts required to satisfy the trust s obligations to third party investors on the trust certificates 
cash so received by srpc may be used to purchase additional accounts receivable from  or make distributions to  the company after srpc has satisfied its obligations on the srpc notes 
the trust may issue additional series of certificates from time to time on various terms 
terms of any future series will be determined at the time of issuance 
total working capital increased million to million at january  from million at february   due primarily to the acquisition of cr anthony 
the company s primary capital requirements are for working capital  debt service and capital expenditures 
based upon the current capital structure  management anticipates cash interest payments to be approximately million during each of and capital expenditures are generally for new store openings  remodeling of existing stores and facilities and customary store maintenance 
capital expenditures in were million as compared to million in management expects capital expenditures to be approximately million during  consisting primarily of new store openings  remodeling of existing stores  the conversion of the majority of the remaining cr anthony stores to the company s format and the implementation of a new merchandising system 
required aggregate principal payments on debt total million and million for and  respectively 
the company s short term liquidity needs are provided by i existing cash balances  ii operating cash flows  iii the accounts receivable program  and iv the credit facility 
the company expects to fund its long term liquidity needs from its operating cash flows  the issuance of debt and or equity securities  the securitization of its accounts receivable and bank borrowings 
management believes that funds provided by operations  together with funds available under the credit facility and the accounts receivable program will be adequate to meet the company s anticipated requirements for working capital  interest payments  planned capital expenditures and principal payments on debt 
estimates as to working capital needs and other expenditures may be materially affected if the foregoing sources are not available or do not otherwise provide sufficient funds to meet the company s obligations 
risk factors leverage and restrictive covenants due to the level of the company s indebtedness  any material adverse development affecting the business of the company could significantly limit its ability to withstand competitive pressures and adverse economic conditions  to take advantage of expansion opportunities or other significant business opportunities that may arise  or to meet its obligations as they become due 
the company s debt imposes operating and financial restrictions on the company and certain of its subsidiaries 
such restrictions limit the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness  to make dividend payments and to make capital expenditures 
see liquidity and capital resources 
future growth and recent acquisitions  liquidity key components of the company s growth strategy are to i continue to identify and acquire new store locations where the company believes it can operate profitably and ii identify and consummate strategic acquisitions 
such expansions and acquisitions could be material in size and cost 
the company s ability to achieve its expansion plans is dependent upon many factors  including the availability and permissibility under restrictive covenants of financing  general and market specific economic conditions  the identification of suitable markets  the availability and leasing of suitable sites on acceptable terms  the hiring  training and retention of qualified management and other store personnel and the integration of new stores into the company s information systems and operations 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve its targets for opening new stores including acquisitions or that such new stores will operate profitably when opened or acquired 
the company s growth strategy may significantly expand the company s capital expenditure and working capital requirements  and the company s ability to meet such requirements may be adversely affected by the company s level of indebtedness and the restrictive covenants contained therein  especially in periods of economic downturn 
economic and market conditions  seasonality substantially all of the company s operations are located in the central united states 
in addition  many of the company s stores are situated in small towns and rural environments that are substantially dependent upon the local economy 
the retail apparel business is dependent upon the level of consumer spending  which may be adversely affected by an economic downturn or a decline in consumer confidence 
an economic downturn  particularly in the central united states and any state such as texas from which the company derives a significant portion of its net sales  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial condition 
the company s success depends in part upon its ability to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences and fashion trends in a timely manner 
although the company attempts to stay abreast of emerging lifestyle and consumer preferences affecting its merchandise  any sustained failure by the company to identify and respond to such trends could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial condition 
the company s business is seasonal and its quarterly sales and profits traditionally have been lower during the first three fiscal quarters of the year february through october and higher during the fourth fiscal quarter november through january 
in addition  working capital requirements fluctuate throughout the year  increasing substantially in october and november in anticipation of the holiday season due to requirements for significantly higher inventory levels 
any substantial decrease in sales for the last three months of the year could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial condition 
competition the retail apparel business is highly competitive 
although competition varies widely from market to market  the company faces substantial competition  particularly in its houston area markets  from national  regional and local department and specialty stores 
some of the company s competitors are considerably larger than the company and have substantially greater financial and other resources 
although the company currently offers branded merchandise not available at certain other retailers including large national discounters in its small market stores  there can be no assurance that existing or new competitors will not begin to carry similar branded merchandise  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial condition 
dependence on key personnel the success of the company depends to a large extent on its executive management team  including the company s chairman and chief executive officer  carl tooker 
although the company has entered into employment agreements with each of the company s executive officers  it is possible that members of executive management may leave the company  and such departures could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial condition 
the company does not maintain key man life insurance on any of its executive officers 
consumer credit risks private label credit card portfolio sales under the company s private label credit card program represent a significant portion of the company s business 
in recent years  some retailers have experienced substantial increases in the rate of charge offs in their credit card portfolios 
although the company did not experience this trend in  any significant deterioration in the quality of the company s accounts receivable portfolio or any adverse changes in laws regulating the granting or servicing of credit including late fees and the finance charge applied to outstanding balances could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial condition 
accounts receivable program the company currently securitizes substantially all of the receivables derived from its proprietary credit card accounts through the accounts receivable program 
under this program  the company causes such receivables to be transferred to the trust  which from time to time issues certificates to investors backed by such receivables 
the accounts receivable program has provided the company with substantially more liquidity through the issuance and sale of such certificates than it would have had without this program 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to securitize its receivables in this manner 
there can be no assurance that receivables will continue to be generated by credit card holders  or that new credit card accounts will continue to be established at the rate historically experienced by the company 
any decline in the generation of receivables or in the rate or pattern of cardholder payments on accounts could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial condition 
in addition  significant increases in the floating rates paid on investor certificates and or significant deterioration in the performance of the company s receivables portfolio could trigger an early repayment requirement  which could materially adversely affect liquidity 
see liquidity and capital resources 
interest rate risk although the company is protected to a certain extent by interest rate caps  investors in the receivables backed certificates of the trust receive interest payments on such certificates based on a floating rate 
in addition  borrowings under the new credit facility bear a floating rate of interest 
if market rates of interest increase  the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected 
see liquidity and capital resources 
year infrastructure the company is currently in the process of finalizing its evaluation of its information technology infrastructure for its year compliance 
the company does not expect that the cost to modify its information technology infrastructure to be year compliant will be material to its financial condition or results of operations 
the company does not anticipate any material disruption in its operations as a result of any failure by the company to be in compliance 
the company has limited information concerning the year compliance status of its suppliers 
in the event that the company or any of its significant suppliers does not successfully and timely achieve year compliance  the company s business or operations could be adversely affected
