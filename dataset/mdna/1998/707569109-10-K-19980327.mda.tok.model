item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s pari mutuel revenues have been derived from i wagering on the company s live races a at the penn national race course  b at the company s otws  c at other pennsylvania racetracks and otws and d through telephone wagering  as well as wagering at the company s racetracks on certain stakes races run at out of state racetracks collectively  referred to in the company s financial statements as pari mutuel revenues from penn national races  ii wagering on full card import simulcasts at the company s racetracks and otws and through telephone wagering collectively  referred to in the company s financial statements as pari mutuel revenues from import simulcasting and iii fees from wagering on export simulcasting company races at out of state locations referred to in the company s financial statements as pari mutuel revenues from export simulcasting 
the company s other revenues have been derived from admissions  program sales and certain other ancillary activities  food and beverage sales and concessions and  beginning in september  gaming machines 
over the past several years  attendance at live racing  on an industry wide basis  has generally declined 
prior to the inception of otws  declining live racing attendance at a track translated directly into lower purses at that track 
as the size of the purses declined  the quality of live racing at the track would suffer  leading in turn to further reductions in attendance 
however  the company believes that increased contributions to the purse pool from wagers placed at otws affiliated with racetracks have significantly offset the effects of declining live racing attendance on race quality  and thereby improved the marketability of many tracks export simulcast products 
indeed  despite declining live racing attendance  total pari mutuel wagering on horse races in the united states has remained relatively constant in recent years 
moreover  a number of states have recently begun to authorize the installation of slot machines  video lottery terminals or other gaming machines at live racing venues such as thoroughbred horse tracks  harness tracks and dog tracks 
the revenue from these gaming opportunities and from the higher volume of wagers placed at these venues has not only increased total revenues for the tracks at which they are installed  but has generally further increased purse size and thereby resulted in higher quality races that can command higher simulcast revenues 
the amount of revenue to the company from a wager depends upon where the race is run and where the wagering takes place 
pari mutuel revenues from company races and import simulcasting of out of state races have consisted of the total amount wagered  less the amount paid as winning wagers 
pari mutuel revenues from wagering at the company s racetracks or the company s otws on import simulcasting from other pennsylvania racetracks have consisted of the total amount wagered  less the amounts paid as winning wagers  amounts payable to the host racetrack and pari mutuel taxes to pennsylvania 
pari mutuel revenues from export simulcasting have consisted of amounts payable to the company by the out of state racetracks with respect to wagering on live races at the company s racetracks 
operating expenses have included purses payable to the thoroughbred horsemen  commissions to other racetracks with respect to wagering at their facilities on races at the company s racetracks  pari mutuel taxes on races at the company s racetracks and export simulcasting and other direct and indirect operating expenses 
the pennsylvania racing act specifies the maximum percentages of each dollar wagered on horse races in pennsylvania which may be retained by the company prior to required payments to the thoroughbred horsemen and applicable taxing authorities 
the percentages vary  based on the type of wager  the average percentage has approximated 
the balance of each dollar wagered must be paid out to the public as winning wagers 
with the exception of revenues derived from wagers at the company s racetracks or the company s otws  the company s revenues on each race are determined pursuant to such maximum percentage and agreements with the other racetracks and otws at which wagering is taking place 
amounts payable to the thoroughbred horsemen are determined under agreements with the thoroughbred horsemen and vary depending upon where the wagering is conducted and the racetrack at which such races take place 
the thoroughbred horsemen receive their share of such wagering as race purses 
the company retains a higher percentage of wagers made at its own facilities than of wagers made at other locations
