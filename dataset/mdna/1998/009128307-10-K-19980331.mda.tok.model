mercy s operations generated net cash flow of approximately million since the acquisition in an increase in deferred revenue on hospital contracts also contributed to the improvement in cash flow from operations 
the increase in costs in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts in contributed to the improvement in the working capital position

repayment of debt and capital lease obligations as well as operating lease agreements constitute the company s long term commitments to use cash 
balloon payments on long term debt of million and million are due in and  respectively 
outlook for the statements contained in this outlook are based on current expectations 
these statements are forward looking  and actual results may differ materially 
operating agreements with four hospital clients are due for renewal in  three of which were successfully renewed in the first quarter 
in the first quarter of  the company decided not to pursue renewal of one of its contracts expiring in and to redeploy the helicopter assigned to that contract to its mercy operations 
the company expects flight activity at current hospital customers to remain consistent with historical levels and expects to begin operations under one new contract in the first quarter of as of december   the company was completing the production of electrical system components for the us air force hh g helicopter and the manufacture of multi functional interior systems for the md explorer helicopter for a british company 
in the first quarter of the company received a follow on contract for the manufacture of additional electrical system components for the us air force hh g helicopter 
in addition  the company signed agreements in the first quarter of to complete the design and integration for various avionics and communications systems in a special use police helicopter and to manufacture and install a medical interior in a bell helicopter for one of the company s hospital customers 
revenue from all of these projects is expected to total approximately million in the company expects authorization to produce and deliver seven additional uh q helicopter upgrades which are included in the and department of defense budgets 
final orders for these units have not yet been received  however  and there is no assurance that the work will be performed or units delivered in or in future periods 
during the products division also expects to complete medical interiors for three bell helicopters for use by the flight services division s current hospital customers 
the products division will also continue to actively market its products and core competencies both domestically and internationally 
in the company expects its subsidiary mercy to expand the geographical coverage of its operations to other contiguous regions 
in addition  the company anticipates operating royalties generated by unimed air  its brazilian franchisee  to remain consistent with historical levels of operations in there can be no assurance that the company will continue to renew operating agreements for the flight services division  generate new profitable contracts for the products division  or successfully expand its mercy operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that unimed air will continue to generate royalties from operations 
however  based on the anticipated level of flight activity for its hospital customers  the backlog of projects for the products division  and the expected growth in mercy s operations  the company anticipates continued profitable operations in year issues the company has conducted a comprehensive review of its computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the year issue which results from computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  resulting in a major system failure or miscalculations 
the majority of the company s software has already been updated for the year and updates on the remaining programs are in process as of december  the company does not expect the changes required for the year to have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
because most of the software updates completed prior to december   were covered by the company s existing maintenance contracts  the amounts expensed in were immaterial
