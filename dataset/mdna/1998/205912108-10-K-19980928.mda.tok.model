in connection with the company s fiscal year end audit  the company discovered side letters setting forth conditions to certain foreign orders in violation of the company s revenue recognition policies 
no violations were found in us orders 
the growth in fiscal for all the company s products was negatively impacted by these violations  although it is difficult to estimate what license growth would have been in fiscal without the violation of company policies

these prior period adjustments are not material to the quarters or year to which they relate  and prior period results were not restated

total costs and expenses before restructuring and unusual charges were flat in fiscal compared to fiscal  reflecting increased spending on marketing offset by lower expenses elsewhere 
selling and marketing expense decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal this decline was primarily due to staff reductions resulting from a streamlining of the sales management structure and reductions in marketing expenditures resulting from targeting of direct lead generating activities 
the decline also was due to a lesser extent  by a reduction in the number of staff as a result of the june  sale of the company s retail business 
selling and marketing expense increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to increased spending on marketing activities to promote the company s new applications 
the increase was partially offset by the cost reduction actions taken in the third quarter of fiscal and decreased commissions on lower software license revenue

realization of deferred tax assets associated with the company s future deductible temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to their expiration 
although realization of the deferred tax assets is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable income or by using a tax strategy currently available to the company 
on a quarterly basis  management will assess whether it remains more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
this assessment could be impacted by a combination of continuing operating losses and a determination that the tax strategy is no longer sufficient to realize some or all of the deferred tax assets 
the foregoing statements regarding the realization of deferred tax assets are forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities exchange act of see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations safe harbor statement for discussion of uncertainties relating to such statements 
a comparative analysis of the factors influencing the effective income tax rate is presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

the company has a million credit agreement which matures on october  borrowings are secured by accounts receivable and the credit agreement contains covenants regarding among other things  earnings  leverage  net worth and payment of dividends

permitted borrowings available as of june  under this credit agreement were million  of which  was outstanding 
borrowings available at any time are based on the lower of million or a percentage of worldwide eligible accounts receivable

the company believes that the combination of present cash balances and amounts available under credit facilities will be sufficient to meet the company s currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the foregoing statement is a forward looking statement within the meaning of the securities exchange act of the extent to which such sources will be sufficient to meet the company s anticipated cash requirements is subject to a number of uncertainties including the ability of the company s operations to generate sufficient cash to support operations  and other uncertainties described in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations safe harbor statement 
market sensitivity analysis the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates 
to reduce the risk from changes in foreign exchange rates  the company selectively uses financial instruments 
the company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency the company at various times denominates borrowings in foreign currencies and enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures related to foreign currency transactions 
the company does not use any other types of derivatives to hedge such exposures nor does it speculate in foreign currency 
in general  the company uses forward exchange contracts to hedge against large selective transactions that present the most exposure to exchange rate fluctuations 
at june  and june   the company had forward contracts of approximately million and million notional amounts  respectively  denominated in foreign currencies 
the contracts outstanding at june  mature through july  and are intended to hedge various foreign currency commitment due from foreign subsidiaries and the company s distributors 
due to the short term nature of these financial instruments  the fair value of these contracts is not materially different than their notional amount at june  and gains and losses on the forward contracts are largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying exposure 
the company conducts business in approximately foreign currencies  predominately british pounds  french francs and japanese yen 
a hypothetical percent appreciation of the us dollar from june  market rates would increase the unrealized value of the company s forward contracts by an immaterial amount 
conversely  a hypothetical percent depreciation of the us dollar from june  market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the company s forward contracts by an immaterial amount 
in either scenario  the gains or losses on the forward contracts are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions 
interest rates the company maintains its cash and cash equivalents in highly liquid investments with maturities of ninety days or less 
the company has the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore the company would not expect its operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a hypothetical percent change in market interest rates on its cash and cash equivalents 
year many existing computer programs use only the last two digits to refer to a year 
therefore  these computer programs do not properly recognize a year that begins with instead of the familiar 
if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results 
programs that will operate in the year unaffected by the change in year from to are referred to herein as year compliant 
certain portions of the discussion set forth below contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities exchange act of  as amended  including  but not limited to  those relating to the year compliance of the company s products and systems  future costs to remediate year issues  the timetable in which such remediation is to occur  the alternatives available to the company to become fully year compliant  the company s mission critical requirements and the impact on the company of an inability of it or its key suppliers to become fully year compliant 
actual results could differ materially from those in the forward looking statement due to a number of uncertainties set forth below 
the company has tested and modified the most current versions of its products to be year compliant 
the company believes that all of its current client server products are year compliant including budgetplus  decision  decisionweb and fdc 
the company expects to release new versions of its principal mainframe products that will be year compliant prior to the end of calendar year the company has no plans to make earlier versions of its products year compliant and will attempt to contact customers informing them of their decision 
not all the company s customers are running product versions that are year compliant 
the company will continue to encourage these customers to migrate to its current product versions 
some of these customers may not be willing to migrate to current product versions because of the cost and time required to do so  including the need to rewrite custom applications which are not year compliant 
the company may decide not to renew maintenance contracts with these customers for periods after fiscal year a significant portion of the company s maintenance revenue in fiscal year was derived from customers running versions of the company s products which are not year compliant  however  customers paying maintenance are entitled to obtain year compliant versions of licensed products at no additional cost 
the company incorporates a number of software tools into its products 
see item business licensed technologies 
the company has performed limited testing of the current versions of these software tools as part of the testing of its products and believes they are year compliant 
in addition  with respect to certain of these software tools  the company has also received written representations or warranties from the vendor that these products are year compliant 
nevertheless  if one of the databases supported by the company is not fully year compliant  sales of the company s products could be impacted 
if any of the company s customers are unable to make their information technology systems year compliant in a timely fashion  they may suspend further product purchases from the company and renewal of maintenance contracts until their systems are year compliant 
because the company s customers are generally large and medium sized businesses and the company has received numerous communications from customers about their year compliance efforts  the company expects most of its customers will become year compliant in a timely fashion  although the company is not in a position to monitor their progress 
the company is currently developing a plan to determine whether its vendors  distributors and leased facilities all of which are referred to as third party suppliers are year compliant 
the plan will include the identification of principal third party suppliers  including those which are mission critical  contact with those third party suppliers to determine their level of year compliance  review of materials provided or published by third party suppliers regarding their year compliance efforts and  with respect to mission critical third party suppliers  some form of additional verification of compliance 
the company expects to initiate this process before the end of calendar year alternative third party suppliers will be identified for those not expected to be year compliant by the middle of calendar the company believes it has a limited number of mission critical third party suppliers and believes that there are multiple alternatives for its mission critical requirements  including handling certain of these functions internally 
the company has completed the assessment of its principal internal information technology systems for year compliance 
with respect to these eight principal systems  the company has upgraded four of these systems with year compliant versions 
the company plans to replace one of the remaining four systems with new third party software  and is currently reviewing alternative vendors 
the company has determined that the system to be replaced could be made year compliant in the event a replacement system cannot be implemented in a timely fashion 
using internal personnel the company plans to modify the three remaining internal systems to make these year compliant 
the company has started the modification process and has scheduled completion by middle of calendar year the company intends to actively monitor progress on this project 
in the event that the systems cannot be modified in a timely fashion  the company will concentrate its efforts on mission critical revisions 
the company also believes that certain of these systems could be replaced with new third party systems which are year compliant  although the time required to implement a new system or the additional costs could be significant 
the company has engaged a third party to assess the company s personal computer and network hardware and software for year compliance and to help develop a plan to make necessary modifications 
the assessment will begin in the fourth quarter of calendar year completion of this project is scheduled for the first half of calendar year since the company continuously upgrades its hardware and software as part of its normal business  much of the older hardware and software is likely to be eliminated prior to the company has contingency plans in the event that these systems cannot be remediated in a timely fashion through the replacement of older equipment 
a failure of one or more of these internal systems to become year compliant  particularly the company s principal internal information technology systems  could require the company to manually process information or could prevent or limit access to mission critical information 
the company s non information technology systems consist principally of telephone and data communication systems 
the company has completed the initial assessment of these systems for year compliance 
remediation has begun and is scheduled for completion in the first half of calendar year if the company s telephone and data communications systems cannot be remediated to become compliant  the company will be required to replace those systems before the end of calendar year the company believes that there are alternative providers of these systems which are year compliant  but to date it has not explored the time required to implement a new system or the additional cost to the company 
most of the costs incurred by the company to date on year compliance issues have been internal staff costs and costs relating to normal product upgrades  which the company has not separately tracked 
as a result  the company is not able to reasonably estimate the amount of such expenditures 
the company presently expects that its future costs relating to year compliance  including replacement systems  will be between million and million 
the company would have incurred many of the costs for these efforts in any event because of the normal process of product and equipment upgrades 
these cost estimates are subject to a number of uncertainties  which could result in actual costs exceeding the estimated amounts including  but not limited to  undetected errors or defects discovered in connection with the remediation process or unanticipated difficulties in completing the remediation in a timely fashion  resulting in the need either to replace more of the systems than originally expected and or hire more personnel or third party firms to assist in the remediation process 
some commentators have stated that a significant amount of litigation will arise out of year compliance issues 
while the company believes that its efforts to address year issues for which it is responsible should be successful  a description of its most reasonably likely worst case year scenarios have been described above 
in addition  it is possible that there will be undetected errors or defects associated with year date functions in the company s current products and internal systems or those of its key vendors 
if any of the foregoing scenarios should occur  it is possible that the company could be involved in litigation 
further  although the company does not believe that it has any obligation to continue to support prior versions of its products after the termination of maintenance contracts covering those products  nor any obligation to make prior versions of its products  including custom applications written by the company  year compliant  it is possible that its customers may take a contrary position and initiate litigation 
because of the unprecedented nature of litigation in this area  it is uncertain how the company may be affected by it 
in the event of such litigation or the occurrence of one or more of the most reasonably likely worst case year scenarios  the company s revenues  net income or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
safe harbor statement certain information in this form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities exchange act of  including those concerning the company s future results and strategy 
actual results could differ materially from those in the forward looking statements due to a number of uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the demand for the company s products and services  the size  timing and recognition of revenue from significant orders  increased competition  the company s success in and expense associated with developing  introducing and shipping new products  new product introductions and announcements by the company s competitors  changes in company strategy  product life cycles  the cost and continued availability of third party software and technology incorporated into the company s products  the impact of rapid technological advances  evolving industry standards and changes in customer requirements  including the impact on the company s revenues of the proposed release by microsoft of an olap database  the impact of recent transitional changes in north american and international management and sales personnel  cancellations of maintenance and support agreements  software defects  changes in operating expenses  variations in the amount of cost savings anticipated to result from cost reduction actions  the impact of cost reduction actions on the company s operations  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  the impact of undetected errors or defects associated with the year date functions on the company s current products and internal systems  the ability of the company to generate sufficient future taxable income or to execute available tax strategies  required to realize deferred tax assets  economic conditions generally or in specific industry segments  risks inherent in seeking and consummating acquisitions  including the diversion of management attention to the assimilation of the operations and personnel of acquired businesses  the ability of the company to successfully integrate acquired businesses and the impact on the company s results and financial condition from debt issued  liabilities acquired  and additional expenses incurred in connection with such acquisitions 
in addition  a significant portion of the company s revenue in any quarter is typically derived from non recurring license fees  a substantial portion of which is booked in the last month of a quarter 
since the purchase of the company s products is relatively discretionary and generally involves a significant commitment of capital  in the event of any downturn in any potential customer s business or the economy in general  purchases of the company s products may be deferred or canceled 
further  the company s expense levels are based  in part  on its expectations as to future revenue and a significant portion of the company s expenses do not vary with revenue 
as a result  if revenue is below expectations  results of operations are likely to be materially adversely affected
