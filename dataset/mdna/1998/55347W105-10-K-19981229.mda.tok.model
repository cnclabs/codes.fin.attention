the company may use a portion of its cash to acquire businesses  products and technologies complementary to its business 
forward looking statement the company believes that its current cash balances combined with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least september  year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
certain computer programs that have date sensitive software and use two digits only may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year management has initiated a program to prepare the company s financial  manufacturing and other critical systems and applications for the year the focus of the program is to identify affected software and hardware  develop a plan to correct that software or hardware in the most cost efficient and effective manner and implement and monitor that plan 
the company will also assess the readiness of its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
the company utilizes other third party software products  network equipment and telecommunications products 
failure of any critical technology components to operate properly in the year may have an adverse impact on business operations or require the company to incur unanticipated expenses to remedy any problems 
there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company currently estimates that the costs associated with preparing internal systems for the year should not exceed  there can be no assurances that as the company continues its program of reviewing internal systems that the costs will not exceed  the company warrants to its customers that its current versions of maximo release and are compliant 
maximo release is intended to be compliant  with the year version to be released by the end of december earlier versions of maximo need to be upgraded to be compliant 
the company s other product project is no longer sold but the company does offer support for this product 
the company will release an upgrade of this product that will enable this product to recognize date data 
the company s other products  maximo scheduler and and p x are currently being tested for compliancy 
the company estimates that the cost to upgrade these products and any other older versions of its products will be approximately  for further discussion on the year  please see year under factors affecting future performance 
euro compliance on january   eleven european union member states will adopt the euro as their common national currency 
thereafter  until january   the transition period  either the euro or a participating country s present currency will be accepted as forward looking statement legal tender 
beginning on january   euro denominated bills and coins will be issued  and by july   only the euro will be used 
a significant number of the company s customers are located  or transact business with  or have operations in participating european union countries 
as a result  the computer systems or software used by these companies may need to be upgraded to comply with data storage and computational euro requirements 
in the first fiscal quarter of  the company will release a new english language client server version of maximo maximo that will accept  store  calculate  convert and report euro currency 
other primary languages will be made generally available in the second fiscal quarter of the amount of development dollars spent on the euro release will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the company has initiated a program to determine what  if any  internal systems need to be replaced to comply with the requirements for the adoption of the euro 
factors affecting future performance the nature of forward looking information is that such information involves assumptions  risks and uncertainties 
certain public documents of the company and oral statements made by authorized officers  directors  employees  agents and representatives of the company  acting on its behalf  may include forward looking information which will be influenced by the following and other assumptions  risks and uncertainties 
forward looking information requires management of the company to make assumptions  estimates  forecasts and projections regarding the company s future results as well as the future effectiveness of the company s strategic plans and future operational decisions 
forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company are subject to the risk that the forecasts  projections  and expectations of management  or assumptions underlying such forecasts  projections and expectations  may become inaccurate 
accordingly  actual results and the company s implementation of its plans and operations may differ materially from forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
the following discussion identifies certain important factors that could affect the company s actual results and actions and could cause such results and actions to differ materially from any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company that related to such results and actions 
other factors  which are not identified herein  could also have such an effect 
forward looking statement rapid technological change the computer software industry is characterized by rapid technological advances  changes in customer requirements and frequent product introductions and enhancements 
the company s success depends upon its ability to continue to enhance its current products and to develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments  respond to evolving customer requirements and achieve market acceptance 
in particular  the company believes that it must continue to respond quickly to users needs for broad functionality and to advances in hardware and operating systems 
any failure by the company to anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments and customer requirements  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  could result in a loss of competitiveness and revenues 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing new products or product enhancements  or that the company will not experience significant delays in developing such new products or product enhancements 
such delays could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that new products and product enhancements developed by the company will achieve market acceptance 
dependence on maximo the company s revenues are primarily attributable to the licensing of its maximo client server product  introduced in  and to related services and support 
revenues from licenses of maximo and related services and support accounted for approximately of the company s total revenues in fiscal the company s financial performance in fiscal will depend on continued market acceptance of maximo 
the company believes that continued market acceptance of maximo will largely depend on its ability to enhance and broaden the capabilities of maximo  by  among other things  developing additional application modules for maximo  versions of maximo and by developing and incorporating into the maximo product technologies that are emerging in connection with the internet 
any factor adversely affecting sales of maximo  such as delays in development  significant software flaws  incompatibility with significant hardware platforms  operating systems or databases  increased competition or negative evaluations of the products  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial results 
the company made the english language version of maximo release generally available in march for new clients 
in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended  the company released primary language versions of maximo in brazilian portuguese  dutch  french  german  japanese  latin american spanish  and swedish 
the failure of maximo to achieve market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial results 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results  seasonality the company has experienced  and may in the future experience  significant period to period fluctuations in revenues and operating results 
the company s revenues and income from operations typically grow at a lower rate or decline in the first quarter of each fiscal year  compared to the fourth quarter of the preceding fiscal year 
in addition  revenues are typically higher in the fourth quarter than in other quarters of the year 
the company believes that these quarterly patterns are partly attributable to the company s sales commission policies  which compensate members of the company s direct sales force for meeting or exceeding annual quotas 
in addition  the company s quarterly revenues and operating results have fluctuated historically  due to the number and timing of product introductions and enhancements  the budgeting and purchasing cycles of customers  the timing of product shipments and the timing of marketing and product development expenditures 
the company typically realizes a significant portion of its revenue from sales of software licenses in the last two weeks of a quarter  frequently even in the last days of a quarter 
large software license contracts may have a significant impact on revenues for any quarter and could  therefore  result in significant fluctuations in quarterly revenues and operating results 
accordingly  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
the company generally ships its products upon receipt of orders and maintains no significant product backlog 
as a result  revenues from license fees in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
a delay in or loss of orders can cause significant variations in operating results 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses are fixed in the short term  and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts 
accordingly  if revenues do not meet the company s expectations in any given quarter  operating results may be materially adversely affected 
competition the market for applications software is intensely competitive and rapidly changing 
while the company believes that it has competed effectively to date  competition in its industry is likely to intensify as current competitors expand their product lines and new companies enter the market 
to remain successful in the future  the company must respond promptly and effectively to the challenges of technological change  evolving standards and its competitors innovations by continually enhancing its own product  services and support offerings  as well as its marketing programs 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be able to compete successfully in the future 
the market for asset maintenance software is fragmented by geography  by hardware platform and by industry orientation  and is characterized by a large number of competitors 
currently  the company s client server versions of maximo compete with products of a number of large vendors some of which have traditionally provided maintenance software running on mainframes and minicomputers and are now offering systems for use in the client server environment 
maximo also competes with integrated enterprise resource planning systems which are provided by several large vendors and which include maintenance modules 
maximo also encounters competition from vendors of low cost maintenance management systems designed initially for use by a single user or limited number of users as vendors of these products upgrade their functionality to enter the client server market 
the mro supply chain management business using electronic commerce has many diverse competitors offering a wide range of differing products  services and technologies 
while the company believes that electronic commerce products and technologies complement the company s existing products  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in this market 
certain of the company s competitors have greater financial  marketing  service and support and technological resources than the company 
to the extent that such competitors increase their focus on the asset maintenance or planning and cost systems markets  the company could be at a competitive disadvantage 
international operations a significant portion of the company s total revenues are derived from operations outside the united states 
the company derived   and of its total revenue from sales outside the united states in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the company expects that international revenues will continue to be a significant percentage of total revenues 
the company expects international revenues to continue to grow in absolute dollars during  and accordingly  continues to invest heavily in international infrastructure  global product functionality and translated versions of financial and other software products 
in the event international expansion and or product globalization efforts are not successful  the company s business operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected 
this international business is subject to various risks common to international activities  including exposure to currency fluctuations  greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  political and economic instability  the greater difficulty of administering business abroad and the need to comply with a wide variety of foreign import and united states export laws and regulatory requirements 
a significant portion of the company s total revenue is derived from international operations that are conducted in foreign currencies 
changes in the values of these foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar have in the past adversely affected  and may in the future affect  the company s results of operations and financial position 
gains and losses on translation to united states dollars and settlement of receivables from international subsidiaries may contribute to fluctuations in the company s results of operations 
to date  the company has not engaged in currency hedging transactions 
the company may in the future undertake currency hedging  although there can be no assurance that hedging transactions  if entered into  would materially reduce the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on the company s results of operations 
the company experienced lower than anticipated revenue growth rates in the asia pacific region during in part due to the economic difficulties that have occurred throughout this region 
there can be no assurances that the economy of this region will recover in the near future or that the company s growth rates in this geographic region will return to the previous levels if the recovery occurs 
dependence on third parties the client server of maximo operate with the oracle  sqlserver  and sqlbase database management systems 
maximo advantage runs on the microsoft access database 
introduction and increased market acceptance of database management systems with which the company s products do not operate  or failure of oracle  or sqlserver could adversely affect the market for the company s products 
the company has entered into nonexclusive license agreements with centura software corporation  scribe technologies  incorporated  cognos corporation  netronic software gmbh  hsb reliability technologies corporation  intelligent labeling technologies  incorporated  weblogic  incorporated  marimba  inc  and intermat  inc pursuant to which the company incorporates into its products software providing certain application development  user interface  business intelligence  content and graphics capabilities developed by these companies 
if the company were unable to renew these licenses  or if any of such vendors were to become unable to support and enhance its products  the company could be required to devote additional resources to the enhancement and support of these products or to acquire or develop software providing equivalent capabilities  which could cause delays in the development and introduction of products incorporating such capabilities 
product development internet the company is currently developing a java based component architect software application to incorporate into the maximo product technologies emerging in conjunction with the internet 
internet technologies and applications generally are developing and gaining acceptance rapidly in the market 
mro supply chain management using electronic commerce is a nascent market with many standards and technologies remaining to be developed 
accordingly  developing technologies pose risks to the company 
the company believes that electronic commerce products and technologies complement the company s existing products 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully anticipate trends in this market  that the company will be successful in internet technology development or acquisition efforts or that the company s internet applications  if developed  will achieve market acceptance 
limited intellectual property protection the company s success is dependent upon proprietary technology 
the company currently has no patents and protects its technology primarily through copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets and employee and third party nondisclosure agreements 
the company s software products are sometimes licensed to customers under shrink wrap licenses included as part of the product packaging 
although  in larger sales  the company s shrink wrap licenses may be accompanied by specifically negotiated agreements signed by the licensee  in many cases its shrink wrap licenses are not negotiated with or signed by individual licensees 
certain provisions of the company s shrink wrap licenses  including provisions protecting against unauthorized use  copying  transfer and disclosure of the licensed program  may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology or development by others of similar technology 
although the company believes that its products and technology do not infringe on any existing proprietary rights of others  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims in the future 
general economic risk factors to date  inflation has not had a material impact on the company s financial results 
there can be no assurance  however  that inflation will not adversely affect the company s financial results in the future 
dependence on key personnel the company is highly dependent on certain key executive officers and technical employees  the loss of one or more of who could have an adverse impact on the future operations of the company 
the company continues to hire a significant number of additional sales  services and technical personnel 
competition for hiring of such personnel in the software industry is intense  and the company from time to time experiences difficulty in locating candidates with the appropriate qualifications within the desired geographic locations  or with certain industry specific domain expertise 
it is widely believed that the technology industry is at or beyond a condition of full employment 
the company does not have employment contracts with  and does not maintain key person life insurance policies on  any personnel 
in addition  the company may need to hire additional skilled personnel to support the continued growth of its business 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain its existing personnel or attract additional qualified employees 
certain risks associated with acquisitions as part of its overall strategy  the company plans to continue to acquire or invest in complementary companies  products  or technologies and to enter into joint ventures and strategic alliances with other companies 
there can be no assurance that the company would be successful in overcoming the risks associated or problems encountered in connection with such business combinations  investments  or joint ventures  or that such transactions will not materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  or operating results 
possible continued volatility of stock price fiscal was marked by significant fluctuations in the market price of the common stock  par value 
per share  of the company the common stock 
factors such as announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company  its competitors and other third parties  as well as quarterly variations in the company s results of operations and market conditions in the industry  may cause the market price of the common stock to continue to fluctuate significantly 
in addition  the stock market in general has recently experienced substantial price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of many software companies and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations also may adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
litigation risks the company is subject to the normal risks of litigation with respect to its business operation 
year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
certain computer programs that have date sensitive software and use two digits only may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year management has initiated a program to prepare the company s financial  manufacturing and other critical systems and applications for the year the focus of the program is to identify affected software and hardware  develop a plan to correct that software or hardware in the most effective manner and implement and monitor that plan 
the company has begun to assess the readiness of its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
the company utilizes other third party software products  network equipment and telecommunications products 
failure of any critical technology components to operate properly in the year may have an adverse impact on business operations or require the company to incur unanticipated expenses to remedy any problems 
there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company currently estimates that the costs associated with preparing internal systems for the year should not exceed  there can be no assurances that as the company continues its program of reviewing internal systems that the costs will not exceed  the company has begun to develop a contingency plan based on the final results gathered from its suppliers and third parties 
the company plans to finalize this plan by end of september the company warrants to its customers that its current versions of maximo release and are compliant

testing is scheduled to be completed by the end of june the company s other product project is no longer sold but the company does offer support for this product 
the company will release an upgrade of this product targeted for the fourth quarter of fiscal that will enable this product to recognize date data after january  and handle leap year calculations 
maximo scheduler and and p x are currently being tested for compliancy 
the company estimates that the cost to upgrade all of its products to be year enabled will be approximately  the company does not believe that the advent of the millennium has caused any positive or negative impact on revenues from the company s software products 
while the company has experienced customer requests to replace non compliant year applications  it also believes that certain market segments have deferred procuring asset maintenance systems while they complete the implementation of erp systems 
the company will continue to monitor the potential impact of the arrival of the millennium on its software revenues 
euro compliance on january   eleven european union member states will adopt the euro as their common national currency
