interest accrues on amounts drawn under the facility at a rate of percent over prime for the heller facility and at a rate of percent over prime for the bank one facility 
availability from the heller facility is determined pursuant to a formula principally consisting of a percentage of accounts receivable subject to certain exclusions 
at march   the company had total cash and unused borrowings of approximately million available for working capital and development 
the heller facility remains in effect until october  and for annual one year terms thereafter unless either party to the credit agreement provides the other with a written notice of termination one year and days prior to the renewal date 
the bank one facility will remain in effect until august  the company is currently negotiating a replacement credit facility in a range of million 
while there can be no assurance that the replacement credit facility will be obtained  management believes that it will be completed during the second quarter of its fiscal year 
if the company is unable to obtain satisfactory financing it would have an adverse impact on the company s ability to execute its development plans 
management will continuously pursue additional capital including possible debt and equity investments in the company to support a more rapid development of the business than would be possible with internal funds

year computer system issue the year issue is the result of computer programs which were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
the company s principal information systems operate in a database environment which uses four digits for the year  and  accordingly  this issue is not expected to have a significant impact on the majority of the company s computer systems 
certain purchased systems used by the company  and for which the company does not control the programming code  use two digits for the year 
these systems are relatively old and have been independently slated for replacement with new systems that better meet the information needs of the company as it expands and deals with the current operating environment 
the company anticipates that these conversions will be completed to provide compliance with the requirements to handle the year issue with no significant operational concerns 
management currently believes that the financial resources necessary to accomplish such compliance will not be material to the company s financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
however  there is no guarantee that the company s expected results will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those expected results 
the company depends on receipt of payment for services from its payor sources most of which utilize computer software to process those payments 
the company has over  individual payors including medicare and medicaid programs  insurance companies and hmo s 
the company is currently unable to predict what effect  if any  the year issue may have on the computer systems of those payors  or in turn on the company 
system maintenance and modification costs to existing software will be expensed as incurred 
the costs associated with purchasing replacement software will be capitalized and amortized over the useful life of the software 
contract management services the company currently provides contract management services to two home health agencies in the louisville  ky area owned by columbia hca health corporation columbia 
columbia has announced its plans to divest itself of its home care operations and the company has expressed its interest to columbia to acquire the managed business 
columbia has announced a transaction to sell its hospitals in the louisville market as well 
due to these changes  the agencies  which previously operated under the caretenders trade name have changed their names 
the company continues to manage these agencies  however a sale of the columbia owned operations may result in termination of the management agreements which generated approximately million of revenues in fiscal and the payment of a termination fee by columbia to the company 
the company also owns and operates a competing agency in the louisville market 
due to the current status of events  the company is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of this matter 
there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have an adverse impact on the company 
health care reform the health care industry  particularly home health  has experienced  and is expected to continue to experience  extensive and dynamic change 
in addition to economic forces and regulatory influences  continuing political debate is subjecting the health care industry to significant reform 
health care reforms have been enacted as discussed elsewhere in this document and proposals for additional changes are continuously formulated by departments of the federal government  congress  and state legislatures 
certain adverse changes in medicare reimbursement for medicare certified home health services became effective for the company on april  see reimbursement changes below 
government officials can be expected to continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery systems and payment methodologies 
changes in the law or new interpretations of existing laws may have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or impermissible activities  the relative cost of doing business  and the methods and amounts of payments for medical care by both governmental and other payors 
legislative changes to balance the budget and slow the annual rate of growth of medicare and medicaid are expected to continue 
such future changes may further impact reimbursement for home health care 
there can be no assurance that future legislation or regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on the operations of the company 
refer to the sections on reimbursement changes and cautionary statements forward outlook and risks below  the notes to the accompanying financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information 
reimbursement changes in august of  president clinton signed into law the balanced budget act of the bba 
this bill made significant changes in the reimbursement system for medicare certified home health services 
the primary changes that affect the company include a reduction in the reimbursement for oxygen therapy services and a restructuring of the reimbursement system related to medicare certified home care agencies 
oxygen reimbursement the reimbursement of certain oxygen therapy services and products was cut for services provided on or after january  an additional cut of will take affect on january  future increases to the reimbursement rate have been tied to the consumer price index and will not resume until management expects the impact on the company to be a decrease of approximately  in revenues annually approximately  in the fourth quarter of fiscal 
bonding requirements for medicare providers the bba now requires medicare providers to purchase surety bonds in amounts generally equal to of medicare reimbursement for periods up to years 
the bonds must be in effect by july   retroactive to february  the company has made arrangements to meet such bonding  the cost of the which is not expected to be material to the company s results of operations or financial position 
under the current rules  agencies that are not able to secure the required surety bonds will be excluded from participation in the medicare program 
in june the offices of two us senators announced hcfa s agreement to defer implementation to no later than february interim payment system for medicare certified home health nursing services the bba also includes a new interim payment system ips for medicare certified home health services 
ips remains a cost based reimbursement system 
however  per visit cost limits have been reduced and a new per beneficiary limit pbl has been added 
ips is effective for all home care agencies for cost reporting years beginning on or after october  for the company s agencies the new system went into effect on april  the bba states that ips will remain in effect until a new prospective payment system pps is implemented for cost reporting years beginning on or after october  the interim payment system  as well as other requirements imposed upon home health providers in the bba were designed to contain the growth in home health care resulting in slower growth in medicare home health expenditures 
as a result of these changes  home health providers will be forced to reduce their costs of providing services and it is expected that utilization of home care services per beneficiary will decline 
under certain conditions  medicare beneficiaries who had previously been entitled to services will no longer qualify under medicare reimbursement guidelines 
approximately of the company s total revenues are subject to the interim payment system guidelines 
the pbl places an aggregate cap on reimbursable costs based on the number of medicare patients beneficiaries served during a fiscal year multiplied by an established rate 
this rate is calculated using a complicated cost based formula which blends historical data from the provider with others in the region or in some cases uses national data 
this has the effect of placing an additional limit on reimbursement 
this serves to create a ceiling on the amount of care that can be provided to the average beneficiary and constrains the utilization of visits per patient 
in passing these new rules congress expressed the intent of reducing medicare home care expenditures by approximately billion over years 
however  calculations made by the congressional budget office cbo indicate that the actual spending reductions that will result from ips as implemented will be more than billion or three times the intent of congress 
the health care financing administration hcfa anticipates that of medicare agencies will be reimbursed less than their cost 
according to the national association for home care nahc agencies nationwide are experiencing an average reduction in reimbursement per patient 
although congress passed the bba in august and it went into effect for many providers on october   hcfa did not publish all the rules and regulations for implementation until march  due to complexities in the rules  particularly differences in the effective date and the per beneficiary limit for different providers  the ultimate amount of contraction in the home care industry and the effective reduction in the medicare home care benefit cannot yet be predicted 
however  the company believes that the reduction in the medicare home health program is likely to equal or exceed the nahc estimate 
in late calendar and early  the company began implementing action plans to operate under ips 
however  the final rules published by hcfa on march  were more prohibitive than the company or the industry expected 
accordingly  in april  the company revised its program to reduce costs further and control utilization for operation in the ips environment 
consistent with industry estimates discussed above  the company has  since april   experienced a decline in volumes  revenues and contribution from this portion of its operations compared with the same period last year 
additionally  the balanced budget act reduced medicare reimbursement for certain oxygen therapy services by effective january as a result of the combined impact of these reimbursement items  the company expects a decline in revenues and earnings from recurring operations for its fiscal year ending march  and anticipates reporting a consolidated net operating loss for its first quarter  ending june  the company is continuing its assessment of the implications of the current reimbursement environment and will  as necessary  make additional cost reductions and other adjustments to its operational and development plans in the future intended to return the company to profitability 
these actions may result in one time charges for severance  branch office closings  impairment of long lived assets and other restructuring activities and may significantly reduce the company s ability to access capital and pursue development activities 
as of march  no such restructuring activities or impairment existed and  accordingly  no provision for any liabilities or impairment charges that may result from such actions has been made in the accompanying financial statements 

in addition to ips  the balance budget act mandated establishment of a prospective payment system pps for home health services by october  april  for the company 
however  rules and regulations have not yet been developed by hcfa and there can be no assurance that such deadline will be met 
in the event that home care pps is not implemented by that date  the bba as legislated requires cost limits then in existence to be lowered by an additional 
such lower cost limits  likely would have a material effect on the operating results and cash flows of the company 
the company is unable to predict how pps will ultimately be designed and implemented and thus is also unable to predict its impact on the company 
however  by its prospective nature  pps should allow providers the opportunity to earn a profit on services which they are not able to do under ips which is cost based 
state legislative proposals continue to be introduced that would impose more limitations on payments to providers of health care services such as the company 
many states have enacted  or are considering enacting  measures that are designed to reduce their medicaid expenditures 
the company cannot predict what additional government regulations  if any  affecting its business may be enacted in the future  how existing or future laws and regulations might be interpreted  or whether the company will be able to comply with such laws and regulations in its existing or future markets 
impact of inflation management does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on income during the past several years
