item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company was founded in february to focus on the design and development of high performance semiconductor memory products 
in march the company filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code the reorganization 
all of the company s obligations set forth in the plan of reorganization  as modified  were satisfied  and  in august  the company received a final decree from the bankruptcy court 
since  the company s business strategy has been to be a supplier of high performance memory products and memory intensive logic products  operating on a fabless basis by utilizing independent manufacturing facilities and  more recently  joint venture facilities as well 
due to favorable market acceptance of sram products introduced by the company  annual revenues grew rapidly through fiscal in addition  from september through september  gross profit increased primarily due to reductions in average unit product costs  higher average selling prices  a shift to higher margin products and an increase in manufacturing capacity to address the increased demand for sram products 
as a result  operating income also experienced substantial growth during that same period 
from october through most of fiscal gross profit decreased primarily due to a decline in average selling prices and to pre tax inventory related charges 
the company recorded pre tax charges in fiscal  and of approximately million  million and million  respectively  primarily to adjust the valuation of the company s inventory to reflect declines in market value for certain of the company s products 
the company anticipates that in the first quarter of fiscal  it will record a material valuation adjustment with respect to its inventory  primarily to reflect a decline in the market value of such inventory 
from april  through the early part of fiscal  substantially all of the company s net revenues were derived from the sale of sram products 
during fiscal  dram products accounted for approximately of net revenues  sram products accounted for approximately of net revenues and graphics products accounted for approximately of net revenues 
the company had introduced mbit dram in mbitx configuration in fiscal during fiscal  the company commenced volume production in micron geometry  of mbit drams in a kbitx configuration and of mbit drams in a mbitx configuration 
the company enhanced its sram product line with the introduction of industrial temperature srams and in april introduced its intelliwatt tm mbit sram products 
the company continued development and sales of graphics accelerator products  and developed its first embedded product  which combines d d graphics controller with megabytes of embedded memory 
finally  the company put into volume production a mbit flash product and introduced a mbit flash design 
flash products did not contribute significant revenue in fiscal a substantial portion of the company s net revenues is derived from a relatively small number of customers in the personal computer industry 
the market for memory products used in personal computers is characterized by price volatility and has experienced significant fluctuations and cyclical downturns in product demand  such as the severe price erosion of drams in fiscal which has continued into the first quarter of fiscal 
while the company s strategy is to increase its penetration into the networking  telecommunications and instrumentation markets with its existing sram products and to develop and sell in volume quantities new products complementary to its existing products  the company may not be successful in executing such strategy 
a decline in demand in the personal computer industry or lack of success in developing new markets or new products could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
results of operations the percentage of net revenues represented by certain line items in the company s consolidated statements of operations for the years indicated  are set forth in the table below 
percentage of net revenues year ended march  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit loss operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative income loss from operations other income  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes income loss before equity in income of usc net revenues 
the company s net revenues increased to approximately million in fiscal  from approximately million in fiscal  an increase of approximately 
the increase in net revenues in fiscal was due primarily to increased sales of dram products  an overall increase in units shipped  and increase in average selling prices due to a change in the product mix of srams and drams 
during fiscal  the company commenced volume production of mbit and mbit dram products in kbitx and mbitx configurations  respectively 
revenues from the company s dram product family grew steadily throughout the year and contributed approximately of the company s net revenues in fiscal during fiscal  the average selling prices for the company s drams declined significantly 
the dram market is characterized by volatile supply and demand conditions  adverse effects of asia s financial problems  more oems switching to build to order processes and rapid technology changes to higher density products 
the company is unable to predict when or if such price declines will stabilize 
a continued decline in average selling prices of drams could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results  as will be the case for the first quarter of fiscal the company also commenced volume production in fiscal of a mbit family of asynchronous sram products 
overall  sram products accounted for approximately of the company s fiscal revenue 
in general  sram prices continued a steady decline throughout fiscal sales of the company s mmui product line contributed approximately of the company s net revenues during fiscal the mmui graphics and video accelerator market is characterized by a large and growing number of competitors providing a steady stream of new products with enhanced features 
the company s flash memory products did not contribute significant revenue during fiscal and prior years 
a significant decline in average selling prices in any of the company s product lines due to competitive conditions  including overall supply and demand in the market  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company announced in may that primarily due to continued weakening in the dram market  the company expects its operating results for the first quarter of fiscal to be significantly below results from the prior quarter  and to result in a net loss for the quarter 
the company s net revenues decreased to approximately million in fiscal  a decrease of approximately from approximately million of net revenues in fiscal the decrease in net revenues in fiscal was due primarily to lower unit demand and lower average selling prices for sram products as compared to the prior year 
during fiscal  one customer accounted for approximately of net revenues 
during fiscal  no customer accounted for or more of net revenues 
during fiscal  one customer accounted for approximately of net revenues 
during fiscal  the company experienced significant deterioration in the average selling prices for its sram and dram products 
the company believes that the decrease in average selling prices was due to a number of factors  including increased supply of srams and drams from foreign and domestic competitors and weakening unit demand for such products 
generally  the markets for the company s products are characterized by volatile supply and demand condition  numerous competitors  rapid technological change  and product obsolescence  conditions which could require the company to make significant shifts in its product mix in a relatively short period of time 
to diversify its product offerings  the company has introduced new sram  dram  mmui accelerators and flash memory products and is developing its capability to produce a variety of embedded memory products 
these changes involve several risks  including  among others  constraints or delays in timely deliveries of products from the company s suppliers  lower than anticipated wafer manufacturing yields  lower than expected throughput from assembly and test suppliers  and less than anticipated demand and selling prices 
the occurrence of any problems resulting from these risks could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
gross profit loss 
the company s gross profit for fiscal was approximately million or approximately of net revenues compared to a gross loss of approximately million or approximately of net revenues for the same period in fiscal the increase in gross profits resulted primarily from increased unit demand for dram products  lower cost of production for dram and sram products  and introduction to volume production of newer  higher density sram products 
these increases slightly more than offset pre tax charges in fiscal of approximately million compared with pre tax charges in fiscal of approximately million primarily to adjust the valuation of the company s inventory to reflect declines in market value 
the company s gross loss for fiscal was approximately million or approximately of net revenues compared to gross profit of approximately million or approximately of net revenues for the same period in fiscal the decrease in gross profit in fiscal resulted primarily from reduced unit demand and lower average selling prices for the company s sram products 
gross profits associated with sales from the company s dram and mmui product families contributed partially to offset the declines attributable to the sram products 
the company is unable to predict when or if declines in the average selling prices of the company s products will stabilize 
a continued decline in any of such average selling prices could result in a material decline of the company s gross profits unless the company is able to reduce its cost per unit to offset such declines 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to reduce its cost per unit at a level to offset a decline in average selling prices 
as indicated above  the company believes that it will incur a net loss for the first quarter of fiscal  and will record a material valuation adjustment with respect to its inventory  primarily to reflect a decline in the market value of such inventory 
the company is subject to a number of factors that may have an adverse impact on gross profits  including the availability and cost of products from the company s suppliers  increased competition and related decreases in unit average selling prices  changes in the mix of product sold  and the timing of new product introductions and volume shipments 
in addition  the company may seek to add additional foundry suppliers and transfer existing and newly developed products to more advanced manufacturing processes 
the commencement of manufacturing at a new foundry is often characterized by lower yields as the manufacturing process is refined 
there can be no assurance that the commencement of such manufacturing will not have a material adverse effect on the company s gross profits in future periods 
research and development 
research and development expenses were approximately million or approximately of net revenues for fiscal  approximately million or approximately of net revenues for fiscal and approximately million or approximately of net revenues for fiscal these dollar increases in research and development expenses were primarily due to the addition of new personnel for development of new products and the enhancement of existing products and expenditures for materials related to such development activities 
during fiscal  the company s development efforts focused on advanced process and design technology  srams  drams  flash memory and mmui accelerator products 
research and development expenses are expected to continue to increase in absolute dollars  although such expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of net revenues 
the company also may incur research and development expenses in connection with development of a variety of embedded memory products 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were approximately million or approximately of net revenues compared to approximately million or approximately of net revenues for fiscal  and approximately million or approximately of net revenues for fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in fiscal was principally the result of higher sales commissions associated with the increase in net revenues and legal fees associated with the sram antidumping proceeding 
selling  general and administrative expenses may increase in absolute dollars  although such expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of net revenues 
other income  net 
net other income was approximately million for fiscal  approximately million for fiscal and approximately million for fiscal constituting approximately  and of the respective fiscal year s net revenues 
net other income primarily represents interest  dividend income and other income or losses from investments  offset by interest expense for long term obligations 
provision for income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate was for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal and fiscal represented tax benefits accrued at applicable statutory rates 
the effective tax rate for fiscal represented taxes accrued at applicable statutory rates partially offset by the effect of research and development tax credits 
equity in income of usc 
the company s investment in usc is accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
in fiscal  the company recorded income of approximately million representing its share of usc s income for the year ended december  the company uses a day lag in recording its share of usc s results of operations 
the company s share of usc s income in fiscal and fiscal was not recorded as it was not material 
factors that may affect future results the company s quarterly and annual operating results have historically been  and will continue to be  subject to quarterly and other fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including general economic conditions  changes in pricing policies by the company  its competitors or its suppliers  anticipated and unanticipated decreases in unit average selling prices of the company s products  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  availability and cost of products from the company s suppliers  the timing of new product announcements and introductions by the company or its competitors  changes in the mix of products sold  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  the gain or loss of significant customers  increased research and development expenses associated with new product introductions  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of the company s products  seasonal customer demand  and the timing of significant orders 
operating results could also be adversely affected by economic conditions generally or in various geographic areas  other conditions affecting the timing of customer orders and capital spending  a downturn in the market for personal computers  or order cancellations or rescheduling 
additionally  because the company is continuing to increase its operating expenses for personnel and new product development to be able to support increased sales levels  the company s operating results will be adversely affected if such increased sales levels are not achieved 
the markets for the company s products are characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  product obsolescence and significant price competition and  as a result  are subject to decreases in average selling prices 
the company has experienced significant deterioration in the average selling prices for its sram and dram products 
the company is unable to predict when or if such decline in prices will stabilize 
average selling prices for dram products  in particular  have continued to weaken significantly through the first quarter of fiscal historically  average selling prices for semiconductor memory products have declined and the company expects that average selling prices will decline in the future 
accordingly  the company s ability to maintain or increase revenues will be highly dependent on its ability to increase unit sales volume of existing products and to successfully develop  introduce and sell new products 
declining average selling prices will also adversely affect the company s gross margins unless the company is able to significantly reduce its cost per unit in an amount to offset the declines in average selling prices 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase unit sales volumes of existing products  develop  introduce and sell new products or significantly reduce its cost per unit 
there also can be no assurance that even if the company were to increase unit sales volumes and sufficiently reduce its costs per unit  the company would be able to maintain or increase revenues or gross margins 
the company usually ships more product in the third month of each quarter than in either of the first two months of the quarter  with shipments in the third month higher at the end of the month 
this pattern  which is common in the semiconductor industry  is likely to continue 
the concentration of sales in the last month of the quarter may cause the company s quarterly results of operations to be more difficult to predict 
moreover  a disruption in the company s production or shipping near the end of a quarter could materially reduce the company s net sales for that quarter 
the company s reliance on outside foundries and independent assembly and testing houses reduces the company s ability to control  among other things  delivery schedules 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry periodically results in shortages of advanced process wafer fabrication capacity such as the company has experienced from time to time 
the company s ability to maintain adequate levels of inventory is primarily dependent upon the company obtaining sufficient supply of products to meet future demand  and any inability of the company to maintain adequate inventory levels may adversely affect its relations with its customers 
in addition  the company must order products and build inventory substantially in advance of products shipments  and there is a risk that because demand for the company s products is volatile and subject to rapid technology and price change  the company will forecast incorrectly and produce excess or insufficient inventories of particular products 
this inventory risk is heightened because certain of the company s key customers place orders with short lead times 
the company s customers ability to reschedule or cancel orders without significant penalty could adversely affect the company s liquidity  as the company may be unable to adjust its purchases from its independent foundries to match such customer changes and cancellations 
the company has in the past produced excess quantities of certain products  which has had a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
there can be no assurance that the company in the future will not produce excess quantities of any of its products 
to the extent the company produces excess or insufficient inventories of particular products  the company s operating results could be adversely affected  as was the case in fiscal and fiscal  when the company recorded pre tax charges totalling approximately million and million  respectively  primarily to reflect a decline in market value of certain inventory 
the company anticipates that in the first quarter of fiscal  it will record a material valuation adjustment with respect to its inventory  primarily to reflect a decline in the market value of such inventory 
the company currently relies on independent and joint venture foundries to manufacture all of the company s products 
reliance on these foundries involves several risks  including constraints or delays in timely delivery of the company s products  reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and costs and loss of production due to seismic activity  weather conditions and other factors 
in or about october  a fire caused extensive damage to united integrated circuits corporation uicc  a foundry joint venture between umc and various companies 
uicc is located next to usi and near usc and umc in the hsin chu science based industrial park 
the company has products manufactured at umc and usc  and owns equity stakes in usc and usi 
uicc suffered an additional fire in january  and since october  there have been at least two other fires at semiconductor manufacturing facilities in the hsin chu science based industrial park 
there can be no assurance that fires or other disasters will not have a material adverse affect on umc  usc or usi in the future 
in addition  as a result of the rapid growth of the semiconductor industry based in the hsin chu science based industrial park  severe constraints have been placed on the water and electricity supply in that region 
any shortages of water or electricity could adversely affect the company s foundries ability to supply the company s products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
although the company continuously evaluates sources of supply and may seek to add additional foundry capacity  there can be no assurance that such additional capacity can be obtained at acceptable prices  if at all 
the occurrence of any supply or other problem resulting from these risks could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results  as was the case during the third quarter of fiscal  during which period manufacturing yields of one of the company s products were materially adversely affected by manufacturing problems at one of the company s foundry suppliers 
there can be no assurance that other problems affecting manufacturing yields of the company s products will not occur in the future 
there is an ongoing risk that the suppliers of wafer fabrication  wafer sort  assembly and test services to the company may increase the price charged to the company for the services they provide  to the point that the company may not be able to profitably have its products produced at such suppliers 
the occurrence of such price increases could have a material adverse affect on the company s operating results 
the company conducts a significant portion of its business internationally and is subject to a number of risks resulting from such operations 
such risks include political and economic instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  foreign currency fluctuations  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology  tariffs and other barriers and restrictions  and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws 
because the company conducts most of its manufacturing operations in asia  and receives a significant amount of its net revenue from sales to asian customers  the foregoing risks heightened in light of the recent financial and economic crisis in asia 
current or potential customers of the company in asia  for instance  may become unwilling or unable to purchase the company s products  and the company s asian competitors may be able to become more price competitive relative to the company due to declining values of their national currencies 
there can be no assurance that such factors will not adversely impact the company s operating results in the future or require the company to modify its current business practices 
additionally  other factors may materially adversely affect the company s operating results 
the company relies on domestic and offshore subcontractors for die assembly and testing of products  and is subject to risks of disruption in adequate supply of such services and quality problems with such services 
the company is subject to the risks of shortages of goods or services and increases in the cost of raw materials used in the manufacture or assembly of the company s products 
the company faces intense competition  and many of its principal competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources  broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers than does the company  any of which factors may place such competitors and potential competitors in a stronger competitive position than the company 
the company s corporate headquarters are located near major earthquake faults  and the company is subject to the risk of damage or disruption in the event of seismic activity 
there can be no assurance that any of the foregoing factors will not materially adversely affect the company s operating results 
most computer programs were designed to perform data computations on the last two digits of the numerical value of a year 
when a computation referencing the year is performed  these systems may interpret as the year and could either stop processing date related computations or could process them incorrectly 
computations referencing the year might be invoked at any time  but are likely to begin occurring in the year the company is in the process of implementing new information systems which the company believes will be year compliant and does not anticipate that it will incur material expenditures for the resolution of any year issues relating to either its own information systems  databases and programs  or its software products 
however  the company could be materially adversely impacted by year issues faced by major distributors  suppliers  customers  vendors  and financial service organizations with which the company interacts 
management is in the process of determining the impact  if any  that third parties who are not year compliant may have on the operations of the company 
current pending litigation  administrative proceedings and claims are set forth in item legal proceedings and in item licenses  patents and maskwork protection  above 
the company intends to vigorously defend itself in the litigation and claims and  subject to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and based upon discovery completed to date  management believes that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position 
however  should the outcome of any of these actions be unfavorable  the company may be required to pay damages and other expenses  or may be enjoined from manufacturing or selling any products deemed to infringe the intellectual property rights of others  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or operating results 
moreover  the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
the company has from time to time received  and believes that it likely will in the future receive  notices alleging that the company s products  or the processes used to manufacture the company s products  infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties  and the company is subject to the risk that it may become party to litigation involving such claims the company currently is involved in patent litigation 
in the event of litigation to determine the validity of any third party claims such as the current patent litigation  or claims against the company for indemnification related to such third party claims  such litigation  whether or not determined in favor of the company  could result in significant expense to the company and divert the efforts of the company s technical and management personnel from other matters 
in the event of an adverse ruling in such litigation  the company might be required to cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  discontinue the use of certain processes  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
in addition  depending upon the number of infringing products and the extent of sales of such products  the company could suffer significant monetary damages 
in the event of a successful claim against the company and the company s failure to develop or license a substitute technology  the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected 
the company also  as a result of an antidumping proceeding commenced in february  must pay a cash deposit equal to of the value of any srams manufactured wafer fabrication in taiwan  in order to import such goods into the us although the company may be refunded such deposits in early see item legal proceedings  above  the deposit requirement  and the potential that antidumping duties will be liquidated in early  may materially adversely affect the company s ability to sell in the united states srams manufactured wafer fabrication in taiwan 
the company manufactures wafer fabrication srams in singapore and has manufactured srams in japan as well  and may be able to support its us customers with such products  which are not subject to antidumping duties 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to do so 
as a result of the foregoing factors  as well as other factors affecting the company s operating results  past performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
in addition  stock prices for many technology companies are subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
if revenues or earnings fail to meet expectations of the investment community  there could be an immediate and significant impact on the market price of the company s common stock 
due to the foregoing factors  it is likely that in some future quarter or quarters the company s operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 
liquidity and capital resources the company s operating activities generated cash of approximately million in fiscal  versus using approximately million in fiscal and providing approximately million in fiscal cash generated by operations in fiscal was the result of a tax refund and changes in working capital accounts offset by a net loss incurred during the fiscal year 
cash utilized in operations in fiscal was the result of an operating loss and an increase in working capital  while cash generated from operations in fiscal was primarily the result of net income generated during the period  partially offset by increases in working capital 
the increase in inventory in fiscal is due to an increase inventory of dram products partially offset by inventory reduction of older sram products as compared to the same period of the previous year 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million in fiscal  approximately million in fiscal and approximatey million in fiscal net cash used in investing activities in fiscal reflect equipment purchases of approximately million and an equity investment in usc of approximately million 
net cash used in investing activities during fiscal including equipment purchases of approximately million and an equity investment in usc of approximately million 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal equipment purchases of approximately million and investments in chartered of approximately million  in usc of approximately million and in usi of approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities of approximately million in fiscal reflects receipt of approximately million from issuance of common stock upon exercise of options pursuant to the company s stock option and employee stock purchase plans  partially offset by the reduction of a long term debt obligation of approximately million and an increase in restricted cash of approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million in fiscal  and approximately million in fiscal net cash generated in fiscal through financing activities resulted from proceeds of a secured loan of approximately million and proceeds of approximately million through issuance of common stock upon exercise of options under the company s stock option and employee stock purchase plans  partially offset by an increase in restricted cash of approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal reflects primarily net proceeds of approximately million from sales of common stock in connection with the company s public offering in april  exercises of stock options pursuant to the company s stock option plan and a receipt from umc of a loan repayment of approximately million 
at march   the company had approximately million in cash  a decrease of approximately million from march   and working capital of approximately million  a decrease of approximately million from march  the company believes that its existing levels of cash  together with proceeds from the sale of million shares of usc stock in april for approximately million  an expected income tax refund and other financing opportunities the company believes to be available to it  will be sufficient to meet its projected working capital and other cash requirements through the end of fiscal in order to obtain an adequate supply of wafers  especially wafers manufactured using advanced process technologies  the company has entered into and will continue to consider various possible transactions  including equity investments in or loans to foundries in exchange for guaranteed production capacity  the formation of joint ventures to own and operate foundries  or the usage of take or pay contracts that commit the company to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods 
manufacturing arrangements such as these may require substantial capital investments  which may require the company to seek additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing  if required  will be available when needed or  if available  will be on satisfactory terms 
additionally  the company has entered into and will continue to enter into various transactions  including the licensing of its integrated circuit designs in exchange for royalties  fees or guarantees of manufacturing capacity 
in february  the company agreed to purchase shares of chartered for approximately us million and entered into a manufacturing agreement under which chartered will provide a minimum number of wafers from its inch wafer fabrication facility known as fab in april  the company agreed to purchase additional shares in chartered  bringing the total agreed investment in chartered to approximately us million and chartered agreed to provide an increased minimum number of wafers to be provided by chartered from fab the company has paid all installments to chartered 
chartered is a private company based in singapore that is controlled by entities affiliated with the singapore government 
the company does not own a material percentage of the equity of chartered 
chartered has also received investments of approximately us million to us million from a number of united states companies  including actel corporation  brooktree corporation  lsi logic corporation and rockwell international corporation  in return for guaranteed minimum numbers of wafers from fab chartered also announced in january that it had entered into an agreement with lucent technologies inc to create a foundry venture  silicon manufacturing partners pte 
ltd  and announced in april that it had entered into an agreement with hewlett packard co 
to create a foundry venture  chartered silicon partners pte 
ltd 
in july  the company entered into an agreement with umc and s incorporated s to form a separate taiwanese company  usc  for the purpose of building and managing an inch semiconductor manufacturing facility in taiwan 
the facility is in full production utilizing advanced sub micron semiconductor manufacturing processes 
alliance s initial contribution of approximately million was paid in three installments between september and july  representing an initial equity ownership of approximately 
in april  the company sold of the outstanding shares of usc  for gross proceeds of approximately million and the right to receive contingent payment of up to approximately million new taiwan dollars approximately us million at the exchange rate prevailing on june   which rate is subject to material change 
as a result of that sale  the company currently owns approximately of the outstanding shares of usc  and has the right to purchase up to approximately of the manufacturing capacity in this facility 
the company anticipates that as a result of an upcoming issuance of shares to usc employees which issuance has been approved by usc s board of directors  the company s ownership position will be diluted to approximately 
a portion of umc s equity contribution was paid through the grant by umc to usc of royalty free licenses to certain umc sub micron process technologies 
to the extent usc experiences operating income or losses  and the company maintains its current ownership percentage of outstanding shares  the company will recognize its proportionate share of such income or losses 
throughout fiscal  the company reported income of approximately million related to its share of usc s income 
the company believes that a number of manufacturers are expanding or planning to expand their fabrication capacity over the next several years  which could lead to overcapacity in the market and resulting decreases in costs of finished wafers 
if the wafers produced by usc cannot be produced at competitive prices  or if there is not sufficient demand for usc s wafers  usc could sustain operating losses 
there can be no assurance that such operating losses will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations 
in october  the company entered into an agreement with umc and other parties to form a separate taiwanese company  usi  for the purpose of building and managing an inch semiconductor manufacturing facility in taiwan 
the facility has commenced volume production utilizating advanced sub micron semiconductor manufacturing processes 
the contributions of alliance and other parties shall be in the form of equity investments  representing an initial ownership interest of approximately for each us million invested 
alliance had originally committed to an investment of approximately us million or ownership interest but subsequently requested that its level of participation be reduced by 
the first installment of approximately of the revised investment  or us million  was made in january the company had but did not exercise the option to pay a second installment of approximately of the revised investment payable in december currently  the company owns approximately of the outstanding shares of usi and has the right to purchase approximately of the manufacturing capacity of the facility 
a portion of umc s equity contribution was paid through the grant by umc to usi of royalty free licenses to certain umc sub micron process technologies
