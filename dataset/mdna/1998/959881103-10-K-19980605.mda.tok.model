as of october  the board of directors determined it was in the best interest of the company to alter its plan for disposing of the discontinued silica operations

operating activities 
for fiscal  the company had net loss of  and net cash used in operating activities of  since the company has sold most of its cherry creek real estate properties  revenues from the sale of real estate in the near future are not expected to be sufficient to fund the company s operations 
in fiscal  the company completed its first sale of water rights  realized revenue from the leasing of its water rights and continued to receive revenue from the sale of portions of its real property located in the cherry creek basin 
the company intends to continue such sales by marketing the remaining acres of real property it owns in cherry creek 
the company expects that the timing and amount of its operating revenues will continue to be highly volatile 
revenues from leasing the company s rice farms and ranches  from the cucamonga water fee agreement  and from principal and interest payments received on promissory notes held by the company will be more predictable  but will be insufficient by themselves to cover the company s general and administrative expenses and the company s interest obligations under the debentures 
revenue from sale of water or water rights and from the leasing of water rights will be dependent on individually negotiated transactions 
there can be no assurance that such transactions can be made on acceptable terms 
accordingly  the company s future operations will be funded primarily from the company s existing financial resources and from proceeds the company may derive from such future water sale transfer transactions that the company may from time to time consummate 
the company s principal business plan is to develop  package and sell its water and water rights to municipalities and other water users  to acquire and sell other water rights  and to provide a variety of water related services to unaffiliated owners of water rights 
accordingly  the company has and plans to enter into water purchase and water sales agreements 
these agreements are typically subject to various conditions which have to be met before a purchase or sale can take place 
management intends to structure such agreements so that the commitments for water purchases and water sales are reasonably in balance 
however  no assurance can be given that management will be able to balance such agreements in the future 
investing and financing activities 
in april  the company received approximately  of net proceeds from the private placement of an additional  shares of its convertible preferred stock at a price of  per share 
in addition  the company sold its interest in the nevada llc for a price of  of which  was paid in cash 
the company is committed to certain material expenditures over the next several years  including the following scheduled payments of principal on existing outstanding indebtedness for fiscal years ending march     and are     and  respectively 
the company is required to make semi annual interest payments of  on the  principal amount of debentures 
the holders of series c preferred stock are entitled to receive  when and if declared  annual dividends in the amount of per share  payable semi annually on january and july of each year aggregating  per year 
the first four semi annual dividend payments july  through and including january  to be made with respect to series c preferred stock may be made  at the sole discretion of the board of directors  in cash or  in full or in part  by issuing additional shares of series c preferred stock 
thereafter  all dividend payments made with respect to the series c preferred stock are required to be paid in cash 
the company believes that its existing capital resources will be sufficient to fund the company s foreseeable working capital needs for a period of at least one year from the date of this report 
the company plans to meet its commitments thereafter from revenues derived from the sale of water or water rights  from refinancing or selling its remaining real estate assets and  if necessary  from future debt or equity financings 
the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its results of operations 
software issues related to the year do not materially affect the company s water or real estate assets or the company s services or competitive conditions 
accordingly  the company does not expect a significant disruption in operations or any significant expenditures as a result of computer software issues related to the year impact of accounting pronouncement issued but not adopted by the company 
during fiscal  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 disclosure of information about capital structure  sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  sfas no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information and sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits an amendment of fasb statements no 
 and the company anticipates that the adoption of sfas nos 
  and will not have a material effect on the financial position  results of operations or liquidity of the company  nor result in disclosures that will be materially different from those presently included in its financial statements 
risk factors the company s business and operations involve numerous risks  some of which are beyond the company s control  that may affect future results and the market price of the company s common stock 
the following discussion highlights some of the risks the company faces 
uneven patterns of quarterly operating results 
the company s quarterly operating results have varied in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future 
these quarterly fluctuations are the result of a number of factors  including the company s dependence on isolated sales of real estate as its principal source of revenues and the sporadic revenues generated to date from the company s water related activities 
until the company enters into agreements for the long term sale lease of water  the company s revenues will continue to be dependent upon periodic and isolated sales of water and or real estate 
because of the variations in the company s quarterly results  the price of the company s common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly 
limited history of operations in principal business 
to date  the company s activities have primarily consisted of i acquiring its various water rights and related assets  ii raising capital to fund both the cost of such acquisitions and its working capital needs  and iii developing its water rights 
although the company operates in two business segments water rights activities and its real estate development and disposition activities  the company anticipates that a majority of its revenues in the future will be derived from its water rights activities 
however  the company only generated   and  of revenue from its water rights activities during the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
accordingly  the company does not have an established record of water rights transactions 
to date  the company s administrative and interest expenses have exceeded its on going revenue from its water and water rights development and disposition business  and the majority of its operating revenue have been derived from the sale of the company s real estate assets 
no assurance can be given that the company will continue to be able to profitably resell its remaining real estate holdings in the future or that it will be able to successfully develop  package and sell water rights 
uncertainty of future real estate revenue 
during the past three fiscal years  revenue from the disposition of real estate have constituted approximately  and  respectively  of the company s total revenue 
to date  the company s real estate sales efforts in colorado have benefited from a strong demand for real estate in the cherry creek basin 
however  no assurance can be given that the current market conditions in the cherry creek market will continue or that the company will be able to profitably sell its real estate assets in the future 
the company s ability to sell its colorado and california real estate properties will also be dependent on general economic conditions  on interest rates  and on the location and particular characteristics of the properties offered for sale 
since the company has sold most of its cherry creek real estate properties  revenues from the sale of real estate in the near future are not expected to be significant 
uncertainty of future water revenue 
the company s business plan is twofold to engage in various water acquisition  transfer  development and sale activities  and to develop and dispose of the real estate that it acquires in connection with the acquisition of water rights 
while the company s current operating revenue has been primarily derived from real estate sales  the company s long term future profitability will be primarily dependent on i the company s ability to sell significant quantities of water from the company s northern california water assets  ii the company s ability to develop and sell water or water rights packages as part of the cherry creek project  and iii the company s activities as an independent water provider in southern california 
until may  the company s plan was to permit the yuba county water agency to integrate the company s yuba property water into the water agency s conjunctive use plans for developing and marketing water to third parties 
the company s agreement with the yuba county water agency regarding the joint development and marketing of water expired in may the company is currently evaluating various alternative plans to commercially exploit its yuba property water rights  but has not yet entered into any agreements to dispose of its yuba property water 
although the company has received the approval of its plan of augmentation from the colorado water court  to date  the company has not yet consummated any water or water rights transactions in the cherry creek area and no assurance can be given that the company will be able to do so in the future 
the company s ability to become an independent water provider in southern california is dependent upon the company acquiring groundwater rights and other water assets  its ability to arrange for the transportation and storage of water  its success in obtaining all necessary governmental and regulatory consents and approvals  and on its ability to finance the foregoing activities 
the water transfer business is a new and developing business in southern california  and the market for such water transfers is still developing 
accordingly  the hurdles that a company engaging in such activities can expect to encounter are not all known  and the timing of completing such transactions is dependent on numerous factors that may not yet be known 
as a result  it is uncertain when or if the company will generate revenues from its new water transfer activities
