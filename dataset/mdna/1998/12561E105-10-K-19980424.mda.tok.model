overview the company is a leading nationwide owner  operator and franchisor of quick service restaurants  operating principally under the carl s jr 
and hardee s brand names 
based on domestic system wide sales  the company s hardee s and carl s jr 
chains are the fourth and seventh largest quick service hamburger restaurant chains in the united states  respectively 
as of january   the carl s jr 
system included restaurants  of which were operated by the company and were operated by its franchisees and licensees 
carl s jr 
restaurants are located in the western united states  predominantly in california 
in july  the company completed its acquisition of hardee s  and as of january   the hardee s system consisted of  restaurants  of which were operated by the company and  were operated by the company s franchisees and licensees 
hardee s restaurants are located throughout the eastern and midwestern united states  predominantly in the southeast 
as of january   the company also operated a total of other restaurants  including taco bueno quick service mexican food restaurants located in texas and oklahoma 
the first carl s jr 
restaurant was opened in by carl n 
karcher  the company s founder  in anaheim  california 
after an extended period of growth  the company made certain strategic decisions and experienced operational difficulties in the early s which adversely impacted the company s sales and profitability 
at that time  in response to the introduction of value pricing by its quick service restaurant competitors  the company reduced prices and initiated an extensive value priced menu advertising campaign 
beginning in october  the company hired a new management team that began implementing a variety of strategic and operational programs designed to revitalize the carl s jr 
brand and improve financial results 
these programs included  among others  a renewed focus on offering superior products  the elimination of most lower priced menu items  a new advertising campaign  a dual branding program with the green burrito and the commencement of a remodeling program for carl s jr 
restaurants 
as a result of these strategies  together with the company s successful efforts to reduce expenses at both the corporate and operating levels  the company experienced significant improvements in sales and operating results in fiscal  and the company substantially completed its remodeling program in january and is continuing to implement its dual branding conversions and focus on reducing expenses 
the company believes it will continue to benefit from such activities in the future 
the company believes that its acquisition of hardee s in july allowed it to significantly expand the scope of its operations and to become one of the leading nationwide operators of quick service hamburger restaurants 
the company has begun implementing a plan to meaningfully improve the profitability and sales of hardee s in an effort to improve hardee s poor recent historical performance 
the company s plan includes many of the operating initiatives which it used to improve the operations of its carl s jr 
restaurants  including implementing cke s management practices  improving the quality of food  enhancing the quality of service  updating restaurant facilities and managing costs more effectively 
the company believes that the fei acquisition will enable it to continue to expand the scope of its operations and to exercise further control over its hardee s restaurant system 
as a result of the fei acquisition   of the  hardee s restaurants operated as of january  are presently operated by the company  representing of the hardee s system  and giving the company control of of hardee s broadcast cooperative advertising markets 
the company believes it can meaningfully improve the same store sales trends and profitability levels at fei s hardee s restaurants by implementing the strategies that it has used to improve the operations of its carl s jr 
restaurants and is beginning to implement at its other company operated hardee s restaurants 
the company s revenues are derived primarily from sales by company operated restaurants and revenues from franchisees  including franchise and royalty fees  sales to carl s jr 
franchisees and licensees of food and packaging products  rentals under real property leases and revenues from the sale of equipment 
restaurant operating expenses consist primarily of food and packaging costs  payroll and other employee benefits and occupancy and other operating expenses of company operated restaurants 
operating costs of the company s franchised and licensed restaurants include the cost of food and packaging products sold to carl s jr 
s franchisees and licensees and lease payments on properties subleased to the company s franchisees 
other operating expenses  including advertising expenses and general and administrative expenses  relate to company operated restaurants as well as franchisee and licensee operations 
the company s revenues and expenses are directly affected by the number and sales volumes of company operated restaurants and  to a lesser extent  franchised and licensed restaurants 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to total revenues  unless otherwise indicated  of certain items included in the company s consolidated statements of income for the years indicated fiscal year ended january  revenues company operated restaurants franchised and licensed restaurants and other total revenues operating costs and expenses restaurant operations food and packaging payroll and other employee benefits occupancy and other operating expenses franchised and licensed restaurants and other advertising expenses general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense other income  net income before income taxes income tax expense net income fiscal includes operating results of hardee s from and after july  fiscal includes million of revenues generated from other restaurant concepts acquired by the company during fiscal as a percentage of revenues from company operated restaurants 
as a percentage of revenues from franchised and licensed restaurants and other 
revenues company operated restaurants 
revenues from company operated restaurants increased million or to billion in fiscal as compared with fiscal carl s jr 
company operated revenues for the year accounted for sales increases of million 
additionally  the company s hardee s and taco bueno restaurants contributed million and million  respectively  to the increase 
offsetting these increases is the loss of revenues from the company s hometown buffet and casa bonita restaurants that were disposed of in connection with the initial public offering of star buffet in september on a same store sales basis  the company s carl s jr 
sales  which are calculated using only restaurants in operation for the full years being compared  increased  marking the third consecutive annual increase in same store sales for the carl s jr 
chain 
same store sales for the company operated taco bueno restaurants increased  while same store sales from company operated hardee s restaurants decreased since the date of acquisition 
the decrease in same store sales for hardee s can be attributed to several factors  including the paring down of hardee s oversized menu and the discontinuation of monthly new product introductions 
the increase in revenues from company operated carl s jr 
restaurants is primarily the result of continued momentum in the company s various sales enhancement programs  including the continuation of conversion of its existing carl s jr 
locations into carl s jr 
green burrito dual brand restaurants  the continued focus on promoting great tasting new and existing food products through increased innovative advertising  and the image enhancement of its restaurants through a chain wide remodeling program 
also contributing to the increase in sales at the carl s jr 
restaurants was the introduction of the charbroiled sirloin steak sandwich in the fourth quarter of fiscal which has recorded the highest sales levels for a new product offering in the past years 
average unit volumes in company operated carl s jr 
restaurants continue to rise and reached  for the trailing week period while average unit volumes at company operated hardee s and taco bueno restaurants ended the fiscal year at  and  for the trailing week period  respectively 
the company s revenues from company operated restaurants increased million or to million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal company operated carl s jr 
restaurants accounted for million of the increase  while the company s other restaurant concepts acquired in fiscal contributed an additional million to revenues  with the company s taco bueno restaurants accounting for million of the additional revenues 
fiscal revenues included approximately million from the company s boston market operations 
the increase in revenues from company operated carl s jr 
restaurants was largely due to the continued effect of the various sales enhancement programs that were implemented in fiscal the same store sales increase in fiscal was the second consecutive annual same store sales increase and the highest same store sales increase reported by the company s carl s jr 
chain in nearly a decade 
an increase in the number of company operated restaurants operating in fiscal as compared with the prior year also contributed to the increase in revenues from company operated carl s jr 
restaurants 
franchised and licensed restaurants and other 
the company s revenues from franchised and licensed restaurants for fiscal increased million or to million over fiscal this increase is principally due to the royalties earned by hardee s franchise system  equipment sales to hardee s franchisees and to increased royalties from  and food purchases by  franchisees and licensees of carl s jr 
as a result of higher sales volume at franchised and licensed carl s jr 
restaurants 
fiscal revenues from franchised and licensed restaurants increased million  or  to million over fiscal the fiscal increase was primarily due to increased royalties from  and food purchases by  franchisees as they experienced increased sales trends similar to those the company experienced in its company operated restaurants 
this increase in sales was offset by a decrease in the number of franchised and licensed carl s jr 
restaurants in operation during fiscal as compared with fiscal operating costs and expenses restaurant operations 
restaurant level margins of the company s consolidated restaurant operations decreased in fiscal by as compared with fiscal  primarily reflecting the impact of typically higher operating costs at the company s family style restaurant concepts  which were acquired in the second quarter of fiscal and at hardee s quick service hamburger restaurants  which were acquired in the second quarter of fiscal the family style segment of the restaurant industry typically has lower margins than the quick service segment of the industry  mainly due to increased labor and food costs 
although hardee s restaurant level margins are substantially lower than the company s other quick service restaurant concepts  the company has increased hardee s company operated restaurant level margins in the fourth quarter of fiscal to compared with for the comparable period of the prior year for restaurants open and operating as of december  the company has accomplished this reduction of costs through many of the same cost saving measures it implemented at its carl s jr 
restaurants over the past three to four years  including the introduction of the carl s jr 
labor matrix to refine labor usage  a focus on safety and accident prevention as a method of lowering workers compensation costs  the reduction of food waste and theft tolerance levels  and the use of substantial purchasing synergies to lower food and paper costs 
also contributing to the increase in restaurant level margins since acquisition is the simplification of the hardee s menu and conforming hardee s depreciation policies with those of the company 
while the company s consolidated restaurant level margins decreased in fiscal  continued cost saving strategies at the company s carl s jr 
restaurants have caused restaurant level margins for the carl s jr 
restaurant chain to continue to increase 
these margins  as a percentage of revenues from company operated carl s jr 
restaurants  were  and in fiscal   and  respectively 
these improved results in the company s carl s jr 
restaurant level operating margins reflect the company s continued commitment to improve the cost structure of its carl s jr 
restaurants  particularly in the areas of increased purchasing synergies for food and paper  improved labor productivity and reduced workers compensation costs 
the company s carl s jr 
food and packaging costs have remained relatively consistent at  and of revenues from company operated carl s jr 
restaurants for fiscal  and  respectively 
during fiscal  food costs decreased marginally due to the purchasing economies the carl s jr 
chain has achieved as a result of the consolidated buying power directly resulting from the addition of its other restaurant concepts 
partially offsetting these purchasing economies realized in fiscal  and contributing to the slight increase in food costs in fiscal  was increased pressure from commodity prices and a change in the product mix as a result of the promotion of larger  more expensive sandwiches such as the charbroiled sirloin steak sandwich  which was introduced in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and the crispy chicken sandwiches  which were introduced in the third quarter of fiscal payroll and other employee benefits for the company s carl s jr 
restaurant chain as a percentage of revenues from company operated carl s jr 
restaurants decreased in fiscal to and decreased in fiscal to 
these reductions in payroll and employee benefits were achieved despite the october and september increases in the federal minimum wage and the additional march increase in california minimum wage levels 
the cost reductions came primarily as a result of labor productivity programs implemented during fiscal to further decrease costs and improve direct labor efficiencies 
further  the new safety and other programs added by the company during fiscal  in conjunction with changes in state regulations  have resulted in a decrease in work related injuries and reduced the company s workers compensation claims and losses during fiscal and many of the company s employees are paid hourly rates related to the federal and state minimum wage laws 
legislation increasing the minimum wage in october and september has resulted in higher labor costs to the company and its franchisees 
moreover  as a result of recent legislation in california  the california state minimum wage was increased effective march the company anticipates that any future increases in the minimum wage may be offset through pricing and other cost control efforts  however  there can be no assurance that the company or its franchisees will be able to pass such additional costs on to customers in whole or in part 
carl s jr 
occupancy and other operating expenses  as a percentage of revenues from company operated carl s jr 
restaurants  were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
a portion of occupancy and other operating expenses are fixed in nature  and thus as a percentage of company operated revenues  they fall as revenues rise 
these costs increased in fiscal as compared with fiscal primarily due to increased equipment costs as the company implements updated data technology at its restaurants and increased utility and depreciation expenses in connection with the image enhancement of the company s carl s jr 
restaurants 
the decrease as a percentage of company operated restaurants in fiscal as compared with fiscal is largely due to the company s efforts to maintain costs at the prior fiscal year levels in conjunction with the fixed nature of the expenses and the increase in revenues in fiscal franchised and licensed restaurants and other 
franchised and licensed restaurant costs increased in fiscal to million as compared with fiscal this increase is primarily due to the additional costs associated with the hardee s franchise operations in addition to increased food purchases by carl s jr 
franchisees and licensees 
as a percentage of revenues from franchised and licensed restaurants  these costs decreased in fiscal over fiscal this decrease is mainly due to the nature of the hardee s franchise revenues  which principally arise from royalties paid by its franchisees  in contrast with the revenues from carl s jr 
franchisees and licensees  which are primarily derived from both royalties paid and food purchases by franchisees 
as a result  the cost structure associated with hardee s revenue from franchised and licensed restaurants is substantially lower than that associated with the carl s jr 
franchise operations 
franchised and licensed restaurant costs in fiscal increased to million 
these costs followed a similar trend to the revenues from franchise and licensed restaurants  with the overall increase in fiscal primarily due to increased food purchases by carl s jr 
franchisees  partially offset by a decrease in the number of franchised and licensed restaurants in operation in fiscal as compared with the prior year 
advertising expenses 
advertising expenses increased million in fiscal over fiscal  and million in fiscal as compared with fiscal  while remaining relatively consistent as a percentage of revenues from company operated restaurants 
the increase in advertising expenses in fiscal is principally due to the additional advertising support for the newly acquired concepts 
in fiscal  as compared with fiscal  the company spent more on advertising production and increased the number of weeks on electronic media 
the company has experienced positive same store sales growth in its carl s jr 
restaurants in consecutive quarters since the company hired a new advertising agency and began its innovative advertising campaign in may  which focuses on carl s jr 
superior quality products 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million and million in fiscal and to million and million  respectively 
as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal is primarily the result of adding the expenses associated with the support of the hardee s restaurant operations 
hardee s general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were approximately for fiscal as compared with of hardee s total revenues at the end of calendar year under previous ownership 
general and administrative expenses have also increased in both fiscal and fiscal due to recording incentive compensation accruals for regional restaurant management and selected corporate employees as a result of improved operating performance 
also contributing to the increase in fiscal were increased amortization expenses and various corporate legal expenses 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal over fiscal was primarily attributable to the economies of scale the company achieved by collapsing certain costs from acquired businesses into the company s existing infrastructure 
interest expense interest expense for fiscal increased million to million as compared with fiscal primarily as a result of additional borrowings required to complete the hardee s acquisition and the write off of certain loan fees associated with the termination or repayment of the company s previous credit agreements  partially offset by a reduction in interest rates 
interest expense in fiscal decreased to million as compared with fiscal as a result of lower levels of borrowings outstanding during fiscal  the prepayment of certain indebtedness early in fiscal and lower interest rates 
other income  net other income  net  is mainly comprised of interest income  lease income  dividend income  gains and losses on sales of restaurants  income and loss on long term investments  property management expenses and other non recurring income and expenses 
other income  net  increased million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  as compared with the prior years 
this increase in fiscal generally resulted from interest income earned on the company s note receivable from checkers and amortization of the related discount along with lease and dividend income recorded from the company s long term investment in boston west 
the fiscal increase was primarily due to increased property management expenses and a gain on the sale of restaurants in fiscal as compared with a loss in the prior year 
moreover  included in fiscal was a million decrease in the company s boston market investment which resulted from the company recording its pro rata share of the losses from boston west 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million in fiscal total cash provided by operating activities increased million to million  which was primarily due to increased revenues from the company s newly acquired concepts and increased revenues and improved operating margins from the company s carl s jr 
operations 
investing activities required the company to use million in cash to fund capital additions of million  to fund the company s investment in checkers of million  to complete the acquisition of hardee s for million net of cash acquired and to complete the acquisitions of certain hardee s franchised restaurants 
the cash required for these investing activities was partially funded by cash proceeds of million net of cash surrendered from the sale of shares by the company and the disposition of its hometown buffet and casa bonita restaurants in connection with the initial public offering of star buffet and million from the sale of property and equipment and from the collection on and sale of notes receivable  related party receivables and leases receivable 
financing activities provided the company with million  primarily through cash proceeds of million from the company s common stock offering 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the increase in total borrowings of million  together with cash flows from operations and cash proceeds from the common stock offering were used primarily to complete the acquisition of hardee s  to repay existing indebtedness  to fund the company s capital expenditures for the conversion of certain of its hardee s restaurants to dual brand carl s jr 
hardee s restaurants in selected markets  to repurchase certain hardee s franchised restaurants  to make million in required principal repayments under the term loan portion of the company s credit facility and to repay million under its revolving credit facility 
additionally  the company generated cash from the exercise of stock options of approximately million and used cash to repay capital lease obligations of million and pay dividends of million 
effective july   the company entered into a new senior credit facility which replaced an unsecured bank credit facility arranged for the company in july on july   the company incurred million of borrowings under the term loan facility and million of borrowings under the revolving credit facility to fund a portion of the consideration needed to acquire hardee s 
as of january   million of borrowings remained outstanding under the term loan facility and million of borrowings remained outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
on april   the company amended the senior credit facility to increase the aggregate principal amounts of the lenders commitments under the term loan facility to million and under the revolving credit facility to million  which includes a million letter of credit subfacility  and to extend the final maturity to april on april   the company incurred borrowings of million under the senior credit facility to finance a portion of the purchase price of the fei acquisition 
principal repayments under the term loan facility are due in quarterly installments commencing in june and continuing thereafter until the final maturity of the senior credit facility in april  resulting in annual reductions of million in the first year of the term loan facility and annual reductions thereafter ranging from million to million 
additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including permitted investments and acquisitions  and any outstanding amounts thereunder will become due in april the company will be required to repay borrowings under the senior credit facility with the proceeds from certain asset sales unless the net proceeds of such sales are reinvested in the company s business  from the issuance of certain equity securities or from the issuance of additional indebtedness 
of the various options the company has regarding interest rates  it has selected libor plus a margin  with future margin adjustments dependent on certain financial ratios from time to time 
borrowings and other obligations of the company under the senior credit facility are general unsubordinated obligations of the company and secured by a pledge of the capital stock of certain of the company s present and future subsidiaries  which subsidiaries guarantee such borrowings and other obligations  and are secured by certain franchise rights  accounts receivable  contract rights  general intangibles including trademarks and other assets of the company and such subsidiaries 
the senior credit facility contains a number of significant covenants that  among other things  i restrict the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness and incur liens on their assets  in each case subject to specified exceptions  ii impose specified financial tests as a precondition to the company s and its subsidiaries acquisition of other businesses and iii limit the company and its subsidiaries from making capital expenditures and certain restricted payments including dividends and repurchases of stock  subject in certain circumstances to specified financial tests 
in addition  the company is required to comply with specified financial ratios and tests  including minimum ebitda requirements  minimum interest coverage and fixed charge coverage ratios  minimum consolidated tangible net worth requirements and maximum leverage ratios 
on march   the company completed a private placement of million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes  in which the company received net proceeds of approximately million  of which million was used to repay indebtedness under the term loan facility 
the notes  which represent unsecured general obligations of the company subordinate in right of payment to certain other obligations  are due in  are convertible into the company s common stock at an initial conversion price of and carry a coupon 
the remaining net proceeds from the notes  together with borrowings under the senior credit facility were used to fund the acquisition of fei on april  the company s primary source of liquidity is its revenues from company operated restaurants  which are generated in cash 
future capital needs will arise primarily for the construction of new restaurants  the remodeling of existing restaurants  the repurchase of certain hardee s restaurants from franchisees  the conversion of certain restaurants to the carl s jr 
green burrito and carl s jr 
serving hardee s breakfast dual brand concepts and capital expenditures to be incurred in connection with the company s integration of hardee s and fei 
during fiscal  the company expects to incur approximately million in capital expenditures 
in addition  the company and imasco holdings continue to discuss certain post closing purchase price adjustments arising from the hardee s acquisition 
the company believes that any payments required as a result of such purchase price adjustments will not materially affect the company s financial condition 
the company typically maintains current liabilities in excess of current assets  because the quick service restaurant business generally receives immediate payment for sales  while inventories and other current liabilities normally carry longer payment terms usually to days 
the company believes that cash generated from its various restaurant operations  along with cash and cash equivalents on hand as of january   and amounts available under the senior credit facility will provide the company with the funds necessary to meet all of its capital spending and working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
if those sources of capital are insufficient to satisfy the company s capital spending and working capital requirements  or if the company determines to make any significant acquisition of or investments in other businesses  the company may be required to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities 
in addition  substantially all of the real properties owned by the company and used for its restaurant operations are unencumbered and could be used by the company as collateral for additional debt financing  however  there can be no assurance that real estate financing or other financing can be obtained on terms acceptable to the company 
sales  if any  of additional equity or debt securities could result in additional dilution to the company s stockholders 
year the company is currently working to resolve the potential impact of the year on the processing of data sensitive information by the company s computerized information systems 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in miscalculations or system failures 
based on preliminary information  costs of addressing potential problems are not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows in future periods 
however  the inability of the company or its suppliers or distributors and other vendors to resolve such processing issues in a timely manner could have a material adverse impact on the company 
accordingly  the company plans to devote the necessary resources to resolve all significant year issues in a timely manner 
impact of inflation management recognizes that inflation has an impact on food  construction  labor and benefit costs  all of which can significantly affect the company s operations 
historically  the company has been able to pass any associated higher costs due to these inflationary factors along to its customers because those factors have impacted nearly all restaurant companies 
during fiscal and fiscal  however  management has emphasized cost controls rather than price increases  given the competitive pressure within the quick service restaurant industry 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 reporting comprehensive income sfas 
sfas establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components revenues  expenses  gains and losses in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
sfas requires all items that are required to be recognized under accounting standards as components of comprehensive income to be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements 
sfas does not require a specific format for that financial statement but requires that an enterprise display an amount representing total comprehensive income for the period covered by that financial statement 
sfas requires an enterprise to a classify items of other comprehensive income by their nature in a financial statement and b display the accumulated balance of other comprehensive income separately from retained earnings and additional paid in capital in the equity section of a statement of financial position 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  management has determined that sfas will not have a material impact on the company s reporting of its consolidated financial position or results of operations and requires only additional disclosure 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas 
sfas establishes standards for public business enterprises to report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports issued to stockholders 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
this statement supersedes fasb statement no 
 financial reporting for segments of a business enterprise  but retains the requirement to report information about major customers 
it amends fasb statement no 
 consolidation of all majority owned subsidiaries  to remove the special disclosure requirements for previously unconsolidated subsidiaries 
sfas requires  among other items  that a public business enterprise report a measure of segment profit or loss  certain specific revenue and expense items  and segment assets  information about the revenues derived from the enterprise s products or services  and major customers 
sfas also requires that the enterprise report descriptive information about the way that the operating segments were determined and the products and services provided by the operating segments 
sfas is effective for financial statements for periods beginning after december  in the initial year of application  comparative information for earlier years is to be restated 
sfas need not be applied to interim financial statements in the initial year of its application  but comparative information for interim periods in the initial year of application is to be reported in financial statements for interim periods in the second year of application 
management has not determined whether the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on the company s segment reporting

the sop requires that costs incurred during a start up activity including organization costs be expensed as incurred 
the sop is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company currently amortizes pre opening costs over one year from the time they are incurred 
management does not believe the impact of the adoption of this sop on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations will be material
