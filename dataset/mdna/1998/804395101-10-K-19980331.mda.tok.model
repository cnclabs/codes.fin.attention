acquisition and development of properties are undertaken only after careful analysis and review  and such property is expected to provide long term earnings and cash flow growth 
during the coming year  any developments  expansions or acquisitions are expected to be funded with bank borrowings from the company s credit line or other external capital resources available to the company

there are no material legal or functional restrictions on the use of ffo 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity

capital strategy and financing activity the company s capital strategy is to maintain a ratio of total debt to total asset value of percent or less  and to actively manage the company s leverage and debt expense on an ongoing basis in order to maintain prudent coverage of fixed charges 
management believes that current total debt remains less than percent of total asset value 
during  the company closed two long term fixed rate mortgages  which management believes enhance the balance sheet 
the first was a million loan closed in january  for a term of years at a fixed interest rate of percent  and a twenty year principal amortization schedule 
a balloon payment of approximately million will be due at maturity in january this loan is secured by the pennsylvania avenue office property 
the proceeds of this new loan were used to repay existing floating rate debt  which had a weighted remaining term of less than years and a weighted average interest rate of libor plus percent  or percent assuming the three month libor rate effective as of december  in october  the company closed another loan in the amount of million  for a year term  at a fixed rate of percent  and a twenty five year principal amortization schedule 
a balloon payment of approximately million will be due at maturity in october this loan is secured by nine of the company s retail properties 
also  in conjunction with the closing of the loan  the company closed a new three year million unsecured credit line  which replaces the previous secured credit line 
the interest rate floats at percent to percent over libor  depending on certain covenant tests 
as of february   outstanding borrowings total million  leaving million of uncommitted credit availability 
this availability provides the company with capital to pursue new redevelopment  renovation  and expansion opportunities within its portfolio 
the proceeds of these new loans were used to repay existing floating rate debt  which had a remaining term of approximately years 
the company now has fixed interest rates on approximately percent of its total debt outstanding  which now has a weighted remaining term of approximately years 
in connection with the refinancing  the company sold all of its remaining interest rate protection agreements

at december   percent of the company s million square feet of leasable space was leased to tenants  as compared to percent at december  the shopping center portfolio was percent leased at december  versus percent as of december  the office properties were percent leased at december  compared to percent as of december  the overall reduction in the year end leasing percentage was primarily caused by the company s termination of a major retail lease for redevelopment  offset in part by improved leasing activity at the company s avenel business park and van ness square office properties
