the company has used energy swaps and other financial arrangements to hedge against the effects of fluctuations in the sales prices for oil and natural gas 
gains and losses on such transactions are matched to product sales and charged or credited to oil and gas sales when that product is sold 
management believes that the use of various hedging arrangements can be a prudent means of protecting the company s financial interests from the volatility of oil and gas prices 
the company recognized hedging gains losses of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these gains losses are included in oil and gas sales in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
at december   the company had outstanding swap agreements covering  mmbtu of gas per month for the period from january to august at fixed prices ranging from to 
the company will receive the difference between the fixed price per unit of production and a price based on an agreed upon third party index if the index price is lower 
if the index price is higher  the company will pay the difference 
the company s current swaps are settled monthly 
miscellaneous the company has initiated a review of its internal information systems for year transition problems and  although such review is still in progress  believes that conversion requirements will not result in significant disruption of the company s business operations or have a material adverse impact on its future liquidity or results of operations 
the company has not extensively investigated the year compliance of its customers  suppliers  and other third parties with whom it has business relationships  but intends to make selected inquiries 
compliance by such third parties is voluntary and failures could occur  in which case there is the possibility of a material adverse impact on the company 
however  the nature of the company s business and its business relationships are not such that the company considers the potential year compliance failure of a third party with whom it has a direct business relationship likely to have a material adverse impact on the company 
the company s oil and gas operations are significantly affected by certain provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  that are applicable to the oil and gas industry 
current law permits the company to deduct currently  rather than capitalize  intangible drilling and development costs incurred or borne by it 
the company  as an independent producer  is also entitled to a deduction for percentage depletion with respect to the first  bbls per day of domestic crude oil and or equivalent units of domestic natural gas produced if such percentage depletion exceeds cost depletion 
generally  this deduction is of gross income from an oil and gas property  without reference to the taxpayer s basis in the property 
the percentage depletion deduction may not exceed of the taxable income from a given property 
further  percentage depletion is limited in the aggregate to of the company s taxable income 
any depletion disallowed under the limitation  however  may be carried over indefinitely 
inflation has not historically had a material impact on the company s financial statements  and management does not believe that the company will be materially more or less sensitive to the effects of inflation than other companies in the oil and gas industry 
the company and its operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 
among these are risks related to the oil and gas business including operating risks and hazards and the regulations imposed thereon  risks and uncertainties related to the volatility of the prices of oil and gas  uncertainties related to the estimation of reserves of oil and gas and the value of such reserves  the effects of competition and extensive environmental regulation  and many other factors  many of which are necessarily beyond the company s control
