item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company derives its revenue from several sources royalties  franchise fees  developer fees consisting of area developer and master licensee fees  company owned restaurant sales  turnkey development  brand contribution private label licensing fees  and other franchise related activities 
between and  developer fees and franchise fees grew to represent a significant portion of total revenue as the company sold development rights for most of the television markets in the united states and certain international territories 
franchise fees  turnkey development and brand contribution increased during this period as the rate at which stores opened increased 
since the company has sold developer rights for virtually all of the united states  developer fees derived from these non recurring transactions have declined as a percentage of total revenue  while franchise fees and royalties based on franchise store sales and revenue from the turnkey program have increased 
royalties are based on a percentage of franchisees net sales and are recognized by the company in the same period that the franchise store sales occur 
generally  royalties are earned at the rate of of sales for stores opened after the year end  and of sales for stores opened before that time 
royalties are paid by means of weekly automatic drafts by the company on franchisee bank accounts for royalty stores 
as of december   franchised stores were paying royalties on a monthly basis at the rate of 
this number of stores will decline as older franchise agreements expire the majority of which will expire after 
a portion of the royalties received by the company are paid to its area developers as royalty service costs for providing on going services to franchisees in their territories 
as more stores open under franchise agreements  the company expects that royalty service costs will approach of royalties 
see business franchising area developers 
royalties have increased since due not only to the growth in the number of stores  but also to increases in average weekly sales 
the increase in average weekly sales is due primarily to the conversion of older franchise stores to the schlotzsky s deli restaurant concept  as well as the selection of more free standing locations for newer stores  which have better visibility and generally experience higher sales than the smaller in line stores located in strip shopping centers which are characteristic of stores opened prior to franchise fees are nonrefundable payments received by the company from franchisees and are typically recognized into revenue as stores open 
the franchise fee for a franchisee s initial store is currently  the franchise fee for each additional store committed to and opened by a franchisee is  expenses associated with franchise fees are shown as franchise fee service costs and include the portion of the franchise fee paid to area developers 
the company generally pays area developers approximately one half of the franchise fees collected from franchisees in their development areas  although the company agreed to pay some area developers up to of certain franchise fees as an inducement to develop their territories more quickly 
as the number of stores covered by these enhanced arrangements begins to diminish and as the company reacquires a limited number of territories  the company expects that franchise fee service costs will decrease as a percentage of franchise fees to approximately 
restaurant sales are reported from company owned stores  and declined between and as a result of the company s strategy adopted in to develop only franchised stores 
the number of company owned stores declined from to two stores between and restaurant sales increased significantly in because the company s flagship restaurant in austin  texas was in operation the entire year and because two additional stores were acquired from franchisees during currently  company stores are operated primarily for product development  concept refinement and training franchisees 
management does not believe that the operating cost of sales for company owned stores is indicative of costs for franchised stores on a system wide basis 
restaurant sales should increase as the company opens a limited number of additional company owned stores 
see business strategy company owned stores 
the company charges developers a nonrefundable fee for the exclusive rights to develop a defined territory for a specified term 
typically  a portion of the developer fee is paid in cash and the balance is paid with a promissory note 
see business franchising area developers and international master licensees 
when the company has fulfilled substantially all of its contractual responsibilities and obligations  such as training  providing manuals  and  in the case of master licensees  reasonable efforts to obtain trademark registration  the company recognizes as revenue the cash portion of the fee and the value of the promissory note  as determined by an independent third party valuation 
these fees have declined in the last two years as most of the remaining domestic territories have been sold and fees from the licensing of international territories  which are not aggressively marketed by management  remain sporadic 
revenue is also generated from brand contribution private label licensing fees and the turnkey program 
the company has licensed manufacturers to produce schlotzsky s private label products and began receiving licensing fees from sales of private label foods to franchisees in late this revenue has increased significantly to  for and  for the company believes that private label licensing fees will increase as system wide sales grow 
see business purchasing  private labeling and risk factors importance of licensing fees 
under the turnkey program  the company works independently or with an area developer to identify superior store sites within a territory 
the company typically purchases or leases a selected site  designs and constructs a schlotzsky s deli restaurant on the site and sells  leases or subleases the completed store to a franchisee 
where the company does not sell the property to a franchisee  the company sells the improved property  or  in the case of a leased property  assigns the lease and any sublease  to an investor 
the company typically guaranties a portion of the lease in favor of the investor  and is indemnified by the franchisee in the event the guaranty is called upon 
revenue and allocable expenses from these transactions have been deferred  even though the company typically receives cash when the property is sold 
from time to time  the company may assign its earnest money contract on a site and the franchisee s lease to a third party investor who then assumes responsibility for developing the store 
upon assignment of its earnest money contract  the company has deferred revenue and allocable costs where it has provided credit enhancement 
the company may charge a fee for managing the construction of a store on a site which it does not own 
this revenue is recognized when the fees are earned and the company has fulfilled its obligations 
the company believes that the turnkey program enhances the company s ability to recruit qualified franchisees by securing and developing high profile sites and achieving critical mass for advertising purposes more quickly in selected markets 
in addition  while the company may be called upon to perform on its guaranties  the company considers this a customary service benefitting franchisees and  ultimately  the franchise system 
the company believes that the guaranties enhance the brand image because they facilitate higher quality restaurants at superior sites which would otherwise be unavailable to many franchisees 
also  the company is immediately benefitted by the increase in cash flows because it has typically received cash of approximately  in excess of its costs associated with each property  and because the company receives royalties on these prototype stores that tend to experience higher than average sales

results of operations fiscal year compared to revenue 
total revenue increased from  to  royalties increased from  to  this increase was due to the full year impact of stores opened in and the addition of restaurants opened during the period from january  to december  also contributing to the increase was the growing influence of larger freestanding stores with higher visibility  an increase in average weekly sales and a increase in same store sales 
franchise fees decreased from  to  this decrease was a result of fewer openings during  as compared to the fewer number of openings is principally the result of the company s increasing emphasis on superior site selection for larger freestanding stores with higher visibility and on more highly qualified and better capitalized franchisees 
developer fees decreased from  to  this decrease was primarily the result of less emphasis on these transactional fees and the fact that the development rights to most domestic markets have been sold 
the company anticipates that developer fees received in the future will primarily result from re marketing development rights it re acquires 
restaurant sales increased from  to  this increase was attributable to a increase in sales volume at the company s flagship store and the opening of two additional company owned stores in in the future  it is contemplated that the company will market to franchisees certain of its company owned stores  but that several other company owned stores will be developed  operated and maintained by the company in certain key markets 
private label licensing fees brand contributions increased from  to  the increase was the result of more favorable terms with certain major suppliers than terms in place in the prior year  as well as the increasing volume of system wide sales and greater franchisee participation in the company s purchasing programs 
turnkey development revenue increased from  to  cash received in excess of costs allocable to turnkey program transactions in which the company provided credit enhancement on franchisees leases was treated as deferred revenue  and accordingly  did not impact the current year s revenue or net income 
revenue in included approximately  of rental revenue from sites completed and under lease 
forty sites developed under the turnkey program were sold during  seven of which had no credit enhancement associated with the transaction  and the revenues from that activity comprises the balance of turnkey development revenue generated during this period 
other fees and revenues increased from  to  this change was primarily due to the increased level of supplier contributions to the company s annual convention held in july costs and expenses 
royalty service costs increased from  to  this increase was a direct result of the increase in royalty revenue for  as compared to royalty service costs as a percentage of royalties grew from to

general and administrative expenses increased from  to  but as a percentage of total revenue decreased from to 
the dollar increase was principally the result of additional personnel at the corporate office  including certain one time expenses related to the hiring and relocation of the individuals 
the percentage decrease is the result of revenue increasing at a greater rate than these expenses for turnkey program costs were included with general and administrative expenses in reflecting the fact that allocable turnkey costs were deferred along with the revenue deferred on certain transactions 
the remaining nonallocable turnkey program costs were insignificant 
depreciation and amortization increased from  to  and as a percentage of revenue increased from to 
this increase was principally due to amortization of goodwill and other intangibles acquired in and  and depreciation related to the additional stores the company was operating during the year 
other 
net interest income increased from  to  this increase was a result of a higher level of funds invested during the more recent period because of the secondary offering 
income tax expense

total revenue increased from  to  royalties and franchise fees increased and respectively  from  to  and  to  these increases were primarily due to the increased number of stores opened during the period as well as the stronger sales volume of the newer stores 
there were store openings in compared to openings in also  average annualized volumes for stores opened in was  compared to  for stores opened in developer income decreased by from  to  and decreased as a percentage of revenue from to

during  four territorial agreements were executed for foreign territories 
in addition  six area developer agreements were executed for domestic territories where the prior area development agreement had been terminated due to failure to comply with the terms of the agreement or where the company bought back the development rights and subsequently resold the rights to new area developers

private label licensing fees increased from  to  because of an increase in the volume of these products purchased by franchisees and the re negotiated terms of two contracts from major suppliers 
turnkey development revenue rose from  to  in of which  was rental revenue for periods of operations prior to the sales of the sites 
the completion of turnkey program sites and the sale of of these sites accounted for the increase in other fees and revenues increased from  to  due primarily to an increase in the overhead recovery from the company s national advertising fund and other nonrecurring miscellaneous fees 
costs and expenses

likewise  royalty service costs as a percentage of royalties increased from to 
franchise fee development costs increased from  to  this increase was a result of the number of stores opened during the period 
restaurant cost of sales  which consists of food  beverage and paper costs  increased from  to  this increase reflects the impact of full year operations at the company s flagship store which opened in austin  texas in november  and the operation of two stores acquired from franchisees in the second quarter of the company expects these costs to increase only slightly in as expenses level off at the flagship store  subject to opportunities to acquire  operate and improve other franchisee stores that are not performing well 
it is contemplated that the company would re market such stores after improvements are made 
restaurant labor cost and operating expenses also reflect the impact of full year operations at the company s flagship store and the addition of the two former franchisee restaurants now being operated by the company 
labor costs increased from  to  additionally  restaurant operating expenses grew from  to  for the twelve months ended december  due to the training and product development performed at the flagship store  the company does not anticipate these costs to be indicative of those of a franchised restaurant 
general and administrative expenses increased from  to  this increase was primarily due to the addition of staff at the corporate office  the strengthening of reserves for certain receivables  and other administrative costs 
in addition  a one time expense related to the exercise of certain stock options by a former employee was incurred in the second quarter of depreciation and amortization increased from  to  the increase was primarily due to first time depreciation of improvements and equipment at the company s flagship store and the two additional stores acquired from franchisees during the second quarter of amortization of pre opening costs for the flagship store and the royalty value related to remarketing the two newly acquired stores were the primary factors contributing to an increase in amortization expense

year compliance the year issue is a result of many computer problems being written using two digits  eg  to define a year 
date sensitive software may recognize the year as the year rather than the year this would result in errors and miscalculations or even system failure causing disruptions in business activities and transactions 
the company s computer software programs utilize four digits to define the applicable calendar year and therefore the company believes that it has no material internal risk concerning the year issue 
any problems the company s suppliers and customers may have related to this issue are not expected to materially adversely affect the company 
the company has not incurred any costs related to this issue and is not expected to incur any material costs in connection with the year issue in the future

quarterly comparisons since the adoption of the schlotzsky s deli restaurant concept in  the company has experienced growth in royalties and franchise fees 
store openings typically mark the recognition of franchise fees and the beginning of the royalty stream to the company 
accordingly  a large increase in store openings has a significant impact on the amount and timing of revenue 
the timing of store openings can also affect the same store sales and other period to period comparisons 
there were store openings in  in and in at january   the initial franchise fee was increased from  to  and was further increased to  effective july  the net profitability from developer fees is substantially higher than that derived from royalties and franchise fees because of the relatively lower costs associated with developer fees 
therefore  quarters in which the company derived a high percentage of total revenue from developer fees reflect substantially higher margins 
while developer fees have been a significant portion of revenue in past quarters  it is anticipated that they will not be material in the future because most of the attractive developer territories in the united states have been sold 
moreover  the company anticipates that royalty and other revenue will continue to increase so that developer fees will decline as a percentage of total revenue  resulting in more normalized margins 
also  the company believes restaurant sales and private label licensing fees brand contributions will continue to increase as a percentage of revenue 
the company recorded a significant fourth quarter adjustment related to activities within the turnkey program 
the adjustment included the deferral of approximately  representing the excess of proceeds received of approximately  over the related development costs of approximately  in connection with the transfer of title or assignment of earnest money contracts on turnkey program properties to various third party investors 
revenue is deferred only in those turnkey program transactions for which the company provides a credit enhancement to the third party investor in the form of a guaranty on the franchisee lease assigned at the same time that the sale or assignment occurs 
the company has also deferred certain costs of approximately  associated with the acquisition  development and  in some instances  construction of the turnkey program properties 
the applicable tax effect of the adjustments was approximately  management believes that the company experiences only moderate seasonality 
the company attempts to make store sales less seasonal by offering a variety of products which tend to sell better during various seasons
