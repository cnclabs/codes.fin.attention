this ruling required all previously capitalized business process re engineering costs incurred in conjunction with a technology transformation project to be immediately expensed in the company s quarter ending december  additionally  all such future costs are to be expensed as incurred

year the company is currently in the process of performing a review of its business systems  and is querying its customers  vendors and resellers with respect to year compliancy issues 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have a time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in normal business activities 
in  the company created a corporate wide year project team representing all business units of the company 
the team was divided into three segments  each of which was tasked with analyzing one of the following three sets of issues i year compliance issues with respect to company internal information systems  ii year compliance issues with respect to the information systems of certain key company vendors and suppliers  and iii year compliance issues with respect to company products that the company sells and licenses to its worldwide customer base 
year compliance issues with respect to company internal information systems the company s management information systems department assumed all year obligations associated with testing  analyzing and implementing the company s internal information systems 
although these activities were not formally assigned to the mis department until  the department had nonetheless embraced such as part of its implementation of new enterprise resources planning systems in this implementation involved replacing all internal information systems with oracle applications release as part of this implementation  the company required certification that all oracle products were year compliant  which such certification has been provided 
the company is in the process of verifying the year compliancy of the oracle products 
internationally  the company currently intends to adopt year compliant oracle applications at certain central locations 
appropriate upgrades to existing systems shall be made at the non central international offices  where deemed appropriate or necessary 
year compliance issues with respect to the information systems of certain key company vendors and suppliers in addition to internal year activities and the review and remediation of the company s internal information systems  the company is in contact with its key suppliers and vendors to assess their compliance 
the company has received to date certain assurances from these suppliers and vendors that any year issues from which they suffer will not materially adversely affect micros 
there can  however  be no absolute assurance that there will not be a material adverse effect on the company if third parties do not convert their systems in a timely manner and in a way that is compatible with the company s systems 
the company believes that its current and future actions with suppliers will minimize these risks 
year compliance issues with respect to company products that the company sells and licenses to its worldwide customer base finally  the company is currently in the process of completing the testing of its existing product offerings 
the testing includes an analysis of both standard products  currently offered  and all custom products that have been offered or developed since  which the company currently supports 
the testing is not performed with respect to any legacy products that the company does not currently sell or support 
in the event that the testing determines that a product may not be year compliant  the company has or will develop either a fix  or a migration path to a product that is year compliant 
while certain potential issues have been identified to date  the expense of upgrading product applications to be year compliant has not been material 
year compliance costs through fiscal  the company has expensed all incremental costs related to the year analysis and remediation efforts 
internal and external costs specifically associated with modifying software for the year will be charged to expense as incurred 
all of these costs are being funded through operating cash flows 
the company believes it is diligently addressing the year issues and that it will satisfactorily resolve significant year problems 
the company anticipates completing substantially all of its year projects during fiscal  with major completion milestones being targeted for the second and fourth quarters of fiscal in the event that the company determines that it may fail to achieve these milestones  additional internal resources will be focused on completing these projects or developing contingency plans 
based on preliminary reviews from presently available information  it is believed that with the company s current installation of a new business operating system  and the significant capital equipment purchases in recent years to upgrade the company s technological capabilities  the additional costs of addressing potential problems are not expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
however  if the company  its large customers  or significant suppliers are unable to resolve such processing issues in a timely manner  it could have a material impact on the results of operations  liquidity or capital resources of the company 
euro conversion on january   certain member nations of the european economic and monetary union emu will adopt a common currency  the euro 
for a three year transition period  both the euro and individual participants currencies will remain in circulation 
after june   the euro will be the sole legal tender for emu countries 
the adoption of the euro will affect a multitude of financial systems and business applications as the commerce of these nations will be transacted in the euro and the existing national currency during the transition period 
as of june   of the eleven countries currently admitted to the emu  the company has subsidiary operations in six of those countries and distributor relationships in the remaining five countries 
micros is currently addressing euro related issues and its impact on information systems  currency exchange rate risk  taxation  contracts  competition and pricing 
action plans currently being implemented are expected to result in compliance with all laws and regulations  however  there can be no certainty that such plans will be successfully implemented or that external factors will not have an adverse effect on the company s operations 
moreover  there is still some uncertainty with respect to the interpretation of certain euro regulations  and the impact of the regulations on the company s euro implementation 
any costs associated with the adoption of the euro will be expensed as incurred and the company currently does not expect these costs to be material to its results of operations  financial condition or liquidity
