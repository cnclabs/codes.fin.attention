overview neose  a development stage company  commenced operations in  and has devoted substantially all of its resources to the development of its enzymatic carbohydrate synthesis technology and to the discovery and development of complex carbohydrates for a variety of applications  including nutritional additives and pharmaceuticals 
in december  the company entered into collaborative agreements with abbott under which abbott has licensed technology from neose for the development by abbott of breast milk oligosaccharides as additives to infant formula and other nutritional products 
the company has received approximately million in contract payments  license fees  milestone payments  and equity investments in connection with its agreements with abbott 
the company has not generated any material revenues from operations  except for interest income and revenues from collaborative agreements  including its agreements with abbott 
the company has incurred losses since its inception and  as of december   had a deficit accumulated during the development stage of approximately million 
the company anticipates incurring additional losses over at least the next several years 
such losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and are expected to increase as the company expands its research and development programs  and as the company expands its manufacturing capabilities 
the company anticipates that the only material sources of revenue for the next several years will be payments under its collaborative agreements  license fees  payments from future collaborative agreements  if any  and interest income 
payments under collaborative agreements will be subject to significant fluctuation in both timing and amount 
therefore  the company s results of operations for any period may not be comparable to the results of operations for any other period 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues from collaborative agreements decreased to million in from million in due to decreased revenues from the company s collaborative agreements 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to the increased preclinical and clinical trial expenditures for ne  increased depreciation expense related to property and improvements expenditures  and financing expenses associated with the montgomery county pennsylvania industrial development authority mcida bond issuance 
research and development expenses are expected to continue to increase in  due principally to additional expenditures in connection with a research and development program with j j see item business agreement with j j and additional clinical trial expenditures 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to increased patent and business development expenses  and expenses associated with being a public company 
interest income increased to million in from million in due to higher average cash and marketable securities balances resulting from the company s public offering in january interest expense increased to million in from million in due to higher average loan balances outstanding during years ended december  and revenues from collaborative agreements increased to million in from million in due to increased revenues from the company s collaborative agreements 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to the hiring of additional scientific personnel  increased purchases of laboratory supplies and services  increased clinical trial expenditures for ne  and increased funding of external research 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to increased patent and business development expenses  and expenses associated with being a public company 
interest income increased to million in from million in due to higher average cash balances resulting from the company s initial public offering in february interest expense increased to  in from  in due to higher average loan balances outstanding during liquidity and capital resources from inception through december   the company had incurred a cumulative net loss of approximately million  and had financed its operations through private and public offerings of its securities and revenues from its collaborative agreements 
the company had million in cash and marketable securities as of december   compared to million as of december  this increase was primarily attributable to the receipt of net proceeds from the company s public offering in january the company sold  shares of common stock at a price per share of 
the company received proceeds of approximately million after deducting placement fees and offering expenses 
the company and abbott have entered into collaborative agreements under which abbott has licensed technology from neose to develop breast milk oligosaccharides as additives to infant formula and other nutritional products 
abbott has development and regulatory responsibilities for the nutritional additives and exclusive manufacturing rights 
the company s agreements with abbott provide  in part  for the receipt by the company of a milestone payment and license fees  if commercialization occurs 
under this arrangement  neose has received to date approximately million in contract payments  milestone payments  and equity investments from abbott 
also  neose is to receive million within days of the first commercial sale  if any  of infant formula containing nutritional additives manufactured using the company s technology 
abbott has agreed to pay neose ongoing fees based on the dry weight of infant formula sold containing nutritional additives manufactured using the company s technology 
the company is required to credit million of the license fees against the ongoing fees in equal amounts over four years 
in addition  abbott has agreed to renegotiate the fees due neose on the sale of products covered by the technology licensed to abbott by neose in any case where  aside from and in addition to such technology  neose has made a contribution in the methods  processes  or compounds used in the manufacture of the product that both parties agree will result in a substantial commercial advantage 
there can be no assurance that abbott will ultimately commercialize any oligosaccharide manufactured using the company s technology  and thus  there can be no assurance that the company will ever receive any further revenues from abbott 
abbott has the option at any time prior to the first commercial sale  if any  of infant formula containing an oligosaccharide manufactured using the technology licensed from the company  to elect to make the underlying license agreement with the company non exclusive  in which event the license fees payable to the company after commercialization would be reduced by  and abbott s obligations to make milestone payments would be terminated 
abbott also has the right to terminate the underlying license agreement upon days notice  in which event it would have no further funding obligations to the company 
in addition  because abbott has failed to make a certain regulatory filing by a specified date  neose  at its option  may now similarly elect to convert the license of the company s technology to a non exclusive license to abbott on the same financial terms 
neose has not exercised that right  and neose and abbott are currently engaged in discussions concerning possible modifications of their agreements 
neose has been advised that abbott is continuing to pursue the development and commercialization of infant formula containing an oligosaccharide manufactured using the company s technology 
there can be no assurance that neose would be able to interest another party in a non exclusive license for these purposes in the event that either party elects to convert to a non exclusive license 
further revenues  if any  from the company s agreements with abbott will depend on abbott s own competitive  marketing  and strategic considerations  including the relative advantages of alternative products being developed or marketed by competitors 
furthermore  abbott is responsible for developing any oligosaccharides manufactured using the company s technology  completing manufacturing scale up activities  and assuring that the compounds  when used as nutritional additives  comply with applicable regulatory requirements  which requirements have not yet been satisfied by abbott 
see item business risk factors extensive government regulation  no assurance of product approval 
the amount and timing of resources abbott commits to these activities are entirely within abbott s control 
there can be no assurance that abbott will pursue the development and commercialization of any products using the company s technology 
no assurance can be given that the agreements will result in the successful commercialization of any oligosaccharides manufactured using the company s technology  or that any future milestone payments or fees will be received by the company 
the suspension or termination of the company s agreement with abbott  the conversion by abbott to a non exclusive license of the company s technology  or a delay by abbott in the development or commercialization of any nutritional additives manufactured using the company s technology would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations

in march  the company purchased its previously leased facility for a total of approximately million 
in addition  beginning in the fourth quarter of  the company commenced a construction project in its facility to expand gmp manufacturing capabilities for ne  and to establish gmp manufacturing capabilities for ne and ne the company believes that the gmp facility now has the capacity to manufacture sufficient quantities of such compounds to complete clinical trials 
in addition  the company believes that it now has capacity to manufacture under gmp conditions certain amounts of these and other carbohydrates for third parties 
in connection with the manufacturing expansion  the company expended approximately million 
see item business manufacturing 
if the technology development program with j j is successful  the parties will have to reach agreement upon the structure and financing of a large scale manufacturing facility 
see item business agreement with j j 
in connection with the purchase of its facility and the expansion  in march  the company issued  through the mcida  million of taxable and tax exempt bonds 
the bonds are supported by a aa rated letter of credit  and a reimbursement agreement between the company s bank and the letter of credit issuer 
the interest rate on the bonds will vary weekly  depending on market rates for aa rated taxable and tax exempt obligations  respectively 
as of december   the effective  blended interest rate was per annum  including letter of credit and other fees 
to provide credit support for this arrangement  the company has given a first mortgage on the land  building  improvements  and certain machinery and equipment to its bank 
in addition  the company has agreed to certain covenants for the maintenance of minimum cash and short term investment balances  and for minimum working capital requirements  and is required to post cash collateral if it does not meet certain of such covenants 
during   and  the company purchased approximately million  million  and million of property  equipment  and building improvements 
the company has incurred negative cash flows from operations since its inception  and has expended  and expects to continue to expend in the future  substantial funds to continue its research and development programs 
the company expects that its existing capital resources will be adequate to fund its capital requirements through no assurance can be given that there will be no change that would consume available resources significantly before such time 
the company s future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors  including progress in its research and development activities  including its pharmaceutical discovery and development programs  the magnitude and scope of these activities  progress with preclinical studies and clinical trials  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  changes in existing collaborative relationships  the ability of the company to establish additional collaborative arrangements  the cost of manufacturing scale up  and the development of effective marketing activities and arrangements 
to the extent that funds generated from the company s operations  together with its existing capital resources  are insufficient to meet current or planned operating requirements  it is likely that the company will seek to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative or other arrangements with collaborators and others  and from other sources 
the terms and prices of any such financings may be significantly more favorable than those obtained by present stockholders of the company  which could have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or the rights of existing stockholders of the company 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed or on terms acceptable to the company 
if adequate additional funds are not available for these purposes or otherwise  the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
in such circumstances  the company may be required to delay  scale back  or eliminate certain of its research and product development activities or certain other aspects of its business or attempt to obtain funds through collaborative arrangements that may require the company to relinquish some or all of its rights to certain of its intellectual property  product candidates  or products
