funds from operations ffo adjusted for operating partnership units industry analysts generally consider funds from operations ffo  to be an appropriate measure of the performance of an equity reit because  along with cash flows from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities  it provides investors with an understanding of the ability of the company to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures 
however  ffo should not be considered by the reader as a substitute to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
the company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the operating results of the company  ffo should be analyzed in conjunction with net income loss as presented in the consolidated financial statements and information presented elsewhere 
ffo is determined in accordance with a resolution adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  and is defined as net income loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization on real estate assets  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the methodology used by the company when calculating ffo may differ from that of other equity reit s and  therefore  may not be comparable to such other reit s 
in addition  ffo does not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use for needed capital replacement or expansion  debt service obligations or other commitments 
ffo per share is calculated using weighted average shares and operating partnership units for the periods presented as follows dollars in thousands  except for shares and units year ended december  loss from operations before joint venture income loss  gains on sales of assets  gains on payoff of mortgage loans  minority interest and extraordinary items    joint venture net operating income    amortization of intangible assets   costs associated with advisor transaction  depreciation    provision for losses on real estate investments   non recurring charges  income allocated to preferred shareholders  funds from operations    cash flows provided by used for operating activities    investing activities    financing activities   weighted average shares    units    total    overview ffo increased from to and from to primarily due to improved operations from the same store apartment communities in addition to the factors discussed previously in results of operations

liquidity and capital resources the company s net cash provided by operating activities increased million in and million in primarily due to increased property net operating income as a result of an increased asset base 
net cash used in investing activities increased million in and million in the increase in was primarily due to increased spending on acquisitions of real estate assets and apartment community development activity of million  offset by increased proceeds from sales of properties and joint ventures of million 
the increase in net cash used in investing activities in over was primarily due to decreased proceeds from the sales of real estate assets of million and increased initial funding of real estate tax and repair escrows of million as required by certain debt agreements assumed in conjunction with the acquisition of multifamily properties 
this was offset by less spending on acquisitions of real estate assets and community development activity of million in the company s net cash provided by financing activities increased million in primarily due to net proceeds received from the company s preferred and common stock offerings of million  offset by net payments on the company s borrowings of million 
net cash provided by financing activities increased million in primarily due to net borrowing activity 
until  operations  debt financing and sales of assets have been the sources of liquidity employed by the company 
in  the company raised additional capital through a private placement of preferred stock and a public offering of common stock  the proceeds of which were used to acquire multifamily properties and to paydown variable rate debt 
operating cash flows are earmarked for the payment of dividends as well as capital expenditures of a recurring nature 
debt financing and proceeds from asset sales have been used to finance the acquisition  renovation  rehabilitation and development of apartment communities 
in each of the previous three years  the company has paid between and of ffo in dividends  retaining the rest for recurring capital expenditures and working capital 
the company expects to increase both ffo and dividends in the future but will strive to gradually reduce the payout ratio so as to utilize some internally generated funds for growth 
on february   the board approved a dividend of 
per share payable on may  to the shareholders of record on may  the company has a policy to maintain leverage at or below of reasonably estimated value of assets 
by employing moderate leverage ratios  the company can continue to generate sufficient cash flows to operate its business as well as sustain dividends to shareholders
