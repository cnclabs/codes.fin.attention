year issues the company is currently in the process of assessing its exposure to the year issue  and has established a comprehensive response to that exposure 
generally  the company has year exposure in three areas i the company s information technology it infrastructure  including computer operating systems and applications  ii microprocessors and other electronic devices included as components of non computer equipment embedded chips and iii computer systems used by third parties  including customers and suppliers of the company 
the it infrastructure and embedded chips are being addressed on a regional level 
the third parties are being evaluated centrally 
the company has completed its assessment of its it infrastructure  and is in the process of completing its evaluation of all microprocessors and other electronic devices  and third party vendors and customers 
the company believes that the western region s critical it infrastructure components and embedded chips are year compliant 
the company has made the minimal changes necessary for its it infrastructure to operate in a year environment 
the company does not utilize two digit date coding logic  and has successfully tested hardware  operating system  and applications software simulating post year systems clock dates 
the company has tested its microprocessors and other electronic devises and is in the process of making any necessary modifications rendering them year compliant 
the company expects that the western region s microprocessors and other electronic devices will be year compliant by february   except for the replacement of the seattle facility s phone system which is scheduled for replacement for other business reasons in july all critical it infrastructure components and embedded chips have been tested and work properly for the year and beyond 
additionally  a third party review has been conducted to understand the western region s year progress and communicate matters that came to their attention regarding such progress 
the company believes the central region s critical it infrastructure components and embedded chips are also year compliant 
the central region does not employ two digit date coding logic and has simulated year system clock dates in tests of its hardware and operating systems as well as selected applications software 
the company anticipates that all year simulation testing will be completed by the end of november the company has also recently completed an independent third party review of the central region s operating system and critical it applications software code which has indicated year compliance 
all other it infrastructure components and embedded chips have been modified  will be modified before january   or if not year compliant will be retired before july  the eastern region is currently reviewing the results of a third party audit of its year systems code for both the cornucopia and stow mills systems 
the eastern region is in the process of moving to one system for operational efficiency reasons 
the stow mills system will become a hybrid of the best functionality components of each system 
the stow mills systems require a number of code changes to achieve full year compliance 
the company expects the existing operating system to be upgraded to a year compliant version during the first calendar quarter of in addition  all code is expected to be year compliant for the surviving stow business systems prior to the end of the first calendar quarter of also  the surviving east region systems clock will be moved forward simulating the year prior to the end of march the existing cornucopia dayville  connecticut and atlanta  georgia systems are not year compliant 
the company is expected to move off these existing systems and on to the surviving stow mills system during the first calendar quarter of all other it infrastructure components and embedded chips have been modified  will be modified before the end of december  or if not year compliant  will be retired before july  the company is in the process of installing new point of sale systems in its retail stores to enable more sophisticated promotions and improved business controls 
the current point of sale or cash registers are not all year compliant 
the company plans to have the year compliant point of sale systems or compliant cash registers in place on or before july the company is in the process of evaluating a solution for the hershey business  which is not currently year compliant 
the company has sent written requests for year information to substantially all suppliers 
the company is currently reviewing the responses received and preparing to send second requests to the top suppliers making up at least of the company s purchases 
the company is also compiling a database of all customers regarding their year status and plans for remediation and will send information requests by the end of november the company is in the process of updating its systems for business functionality reasons and has adopted a going forward systems strategy of staying current with state of the art systems technology 
furthermore  the company is in the process of integrating acquisitions to achieve customer service and operating efficiency improvements  which require common state of the art systems technology 
accordingly  all business systems changes would be performed regardless of the year issue both from a timing and cost perspective 
the company therefore believes that it has spent and is spending an immaterial incremental amount on year remediation over what it would spend to execute its going forward systems strategy 
the company has significantly increased its it expenditures to execute its systems strategy which includes any immaterial incremental amounts to achieve year compliance 
the company expects to spend on it systems and support approximately million in fiscal and spent approximately million and million in fiscal and respectively 
the dates on which the company believes it will be year compliant are based on management s plans for work to be performed and best estimates which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results may differ materially from those anticipated 
if the company is unsuccessful in completing remediation of non compliant systems  correcting embedded chips or if customers or suppliers cannot rectify their year issues  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company has not yet established a contingency plan in the event of non compliance by any parties and has a timeline to prepare such contingency plans for any critical application falling behind schedule after the completion of the first calendar quarter of certain factors that may affect future results the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
any statements contained herein including without limitations statements to the effect that the company or its management believes  expects  anticipates  plans and similar expressions that are not statements of historical fact should be considered forward looking statements 
results of operations in any past period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for future periods 
fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the price of the company s common stock 
a number of uncertainties exist that could affect the company s future operating results  including  without limitation  continued demand for current products offered by the company  the success of the company s acquisition strategy  competitive pressures  general economic conditions  the success of new product introductions and government regulation 
a significant portion of the company s historical growth has been achieved through acquisitions of or mergers with other distributors of natural products 
the company merged with stow mills in october the successful and timely integration of this merger is critical to the future operating and financial performance of the company 
the company believes that the integration of stow mills will not be substantially completed until mid calendar the integration will require  among other things  coordination of administrative  distribution and finance functions  the integration of personnel and expansion of information and warehouse management systems among the company s regional operations 
the integration process could divert the attention of management  and any difficulties or problems encountered in the transition process could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  the process of combining the companies could cause the interruption of  or a loss of momentum in  the activities of the respective businesses  which could have an adverse effect on their combined operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will retain key employees of stow mills or that the company will realize any of the other anticipated benefits of the stow mills merger 
the growth in the size of the company s business and operations has placed and is expected to continue to place a significant strain on the company s management 
the company s future growth is limited in part by the size and location of its distribution centers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully expand its existing distribution facilities or open new distribution facilities in new or existing markets to facilitate growth 
in addition  the company s growth strategy to expand its market presence includes possible additional acquisitions 
to the extent the company s future growth includes acquisitions  there can be no assurance that the company will successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates  consummate and integrate such potential acquisitions or expand into new markets 
the company s ability to compete effectively and to manage future growth  if any  will depend on its ability to continue to implement and improve operational  financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to expand  train  motivate and manage its work force 
there can be no assurance that the company s personnel  systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support the company s operations 
the inability of the company to manage its growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company operates in highly competitive markets  and its future success will be largely dependent on its ability to provide quality products and services at competitive prices 
the company s competition comes from a variety of sources  including other distributors of natural products as well as specialty grocery and mass market grocery distributors 
there can be no assurance that mass market grocery distributors will not increase their emphasis on natural products and more directly compete with the company or that new competitors will not enter the market 
these distributors may have been in business longer than the company  may have substantially greater financial and other resources than the company and may be better established in their markets 
there can be no assurance that the company s current or potential competitors will not provide services comparable or superior to those provided by the company or adapt more quickly than the company to evolving industry trends or changing market requirements 
it is also possible that alliances among competitors may develop and rapidly acquire significant market share or that certain of the company s customers will increase distribution to their own retail facilities 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors 
the ability of the company to maintain close  mutually beneficial relationships with its top two customers  whole foods and wild oats  is important to the ongoing growth and profitability of its business 
whole foods  the company s largest customer  accounted for approximately of the company s net sales during the fiscal year ended july  as a result of this concentration of the company s customer base  the loss or cancellation of business from either of these customers  including from increased distribution to their own facilities  could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company s sales are made pursuant to purchase orders and therefore the company generally has no agreements with or commitments from its customers for the purchase of products 
no assurance can be given that the company s customers will maintain or increase their sales volumes or orders for the products supplied by the company or that the company will be able to maintain or add to its existing customer base 
the grocery distribution industry generally is characterized by relatively high volume with relatively low profit margins 
the continuing consolidation of retailers in the natural products industry and the emergence of super natural chains may have an adverse effect on the company s profit margins in the future as more customers qualify for greater volume discounts offered by the company 
the grocery industry is also sensitive to national and regional economic conditions  and the demand for products supplied by the company may be adversely affected from time to time by economic downturns 
in addition  the company s operating results are particularly sensitive to  and may be materially adversely affected by  difficulties with the collectibility of accounts receivable  inventory control  competitive pricing pressures and unexpected increases in fuel or other transportation related costs 
there can be no assurance that one or more of such factors will not materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
management of the company s business is substantially dependent on the services of norman a 
cloutier  the company s chairman of the board and chief executive officer  robert t 
cirulnick  the company s chief financial officer  and other key management employees 
loss of the services of such officers or any other key management employee could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company s net sales and operating results may vary significantly from period to period due to factors such as changes in the company s operating expenses  management s ability to execute the company s business and growth strategies  personnel changes  demand for natural products  supply shortages and general economic conditions 
both the company s distribution and retail businesses are dependent upon consumer preferences and demands for natural products  including levels of enthusiasm for health  fitness and environmental issues 
furthermore  the future operating performance of the company is directly influenced by natural product prices  which can be volatile and fluctuate according to competitive pressures 
a lack of an adequate supply of high quality agricultural products or volatility in prices resulting from poor growing conditions  natural disasters or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any future acquisitions by the company will not have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations  particularly in periods immediately following the consummation of such transactions  while the operations of the acquired businesses are being integrated into the company s operations 
due to the foregoing factors  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its operating results may not necessarily be meaningful and that such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
the company s business is highly regulated at the federal  state and local levels and its products and distribution operations require various licenses  permits and approvals 
in particular  the company s products are subject to inspection by the us food and drug administration  its warehouse and distribution facilities are subject to inspection by the us department of agriculture and state health authorities  and its trucking operations are regulated by the us department of transportation and the us federal highway administration 
the loss or revocation of any existing licenses  permits or approvals or the failure to obtain any additional licenses  permits or approvals in new jurisdictions where the company intends to do business could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
as of july   the company s executive officers and directors  and their affiliates  and the esot will beneficially own in the aggregate approximately of the company s common stock 
accordingly  these stockholders  if acting together  would have the ability to elect the company s directors and may have the ability to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  irrespective of how other stockholders of the company may vote 
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company 
see management and principal and selling stockholders 
as of july   approximately employees  representing approximately of the company s  employees  were union members 
the company is currently  and has in the past been  the focus of union organizing efforts 
as the company increases its employee base and broadens its distribution operations to new geographic markets  its increased visibility could result in increased or expanded union organizing efforts 
although the company has not experienced a work stoppage to date  if additional employees of the company were to unionize  the company could be subject to work stoppages and increases in labor costs  either of which could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations
