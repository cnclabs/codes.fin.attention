item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for the years ended december   and consolidated net income increased by to million in from million in which was in turn a increase over the million earned in the increase in earnings was primarily attributable to the growth experienced in the program business segment which benefited from the acquisition of small business underwriters sbu as well as the expansion of professional underwriters corporation puc into new york state 
earnings growth was also a result of the growth in the program business segment  as well as the acquisitions of the hemisphere group limited hemisphere and puc 
set forth in table i is an analysis of the components of the company s revenues for each of the last three years 
revenue is not considered to be the best measure of the company s performance since it includes premiums earned which historically have been closely matched by total insurance costs and should not have a significant impact on net income 
excluding premiums earned  revenues increased in by over which increased over table i revenues year ended december  growth growth in thousands fee income    premiums earned    net investment income    realized capital losses    other income total    the growth of fee income has been primarily due to the strong growth in program business which more than compensated for the decline in corporate risk management business 
overall  pre tax profit margins on fee income continue to remain steady at in compared to in and in segment analysis the components of fee income by business segment are illustrated in table ii 
table ii fee income by business segment year ended december  growth growth in thousands program business fees    corporate risk management fees    specialty brokerage fees    financial services fees    total    program business program business  the fastest growing segment of the company s business  involves replacing traditional insurers as the conduit between producers of specialty books of business and reinsurers wishing to write that business 
program business accounted for of total fee income for compared to in and in this growth has resulted from the continued expansion of this business as a result of reinsurers increased appetite for premium volume in this soft market  and the acquisition of sbu on february  fees earned on individual program accounts are more likely to grow compared to corporate accounts  because new policy holders are constantly being added in each program  also they have a higher retention rate than corporate accounts due to the complexity of program accounts 
pre tax margins in this segment were for compared to in and in the decrease in margins in was due to the acquisition of puc which has lower margins due to the labor intensive nature of its services 
corporate risk management corporate risk management  the company s original business segment  involves providing services to businesses and associations seeking to insure a portion of their risk in a loss sensitive alternative market structure 
this segment  which accounted for of total fee income for compared to in and in  has been the most affected by the extremely soft insurance market cycle for commercial risks 
corporate risk management fees decreased in for the first time due to these soft market conditions 
the number of corporate risk management accounts decreased in to from in which was in turn down from in profit margins remained consistent  despite the difficult market  at in compared to in and in historically  workers compensation has been the major line of business written by the company in both its corporate risk and program business segments 
competition for workers compensation business has increased in recent years  as a result of generally improved reported underwriting results and workers compensation reform legislation 
the resulting under pricing of workers compensation risks by traditional insurers reduces the incentive for insureds to enter alternative market vehicles such as those offered by the company in its corporate risk management segment 
despite these competitive forces  the company was successful in increasing its business in most states as a result of the attractiveness of program business in this soft reinsurance market 
in the company added new program and corporate risk accounts in california compared to in and in  while increasing the renewal rate to from in and in there were california based accounts at the end of compared to in and in the company continued to strive to diversify its business to reduce its reliance on the workers compensation market and was successful in doing so 
as a percentage of total fee income  workers compensation accounts decreased from over at december  to at december  as a result of the company writing accounts which comprise other lines of coverage such as commercial auto liability  auto physical damage and other liability coverages as well as the expansion of the company s financial services segment 
specialty brokerage the company s specialty brokerage business segment provides access to alternative risk transfer insurers and reinsurers in bermuda and europe 
despite declines in premium on new and renewal policies  fees in this segment continued to grow 
renewal rates remained high at for compared to for and for profit margins decreased slightly to from in and in financial services financial services  the company s newest business segment  is being built on the acquisition of hemisphere which provides administrative services to offshore mutual funds and other companies 
the financial services segment also includes the company s newly launched family of proprietary mutual funds and mrm life 
mrm life was recently incorporated to issue variable insurance products in bermuda 
this segment accounted for of total fee income for both and up from in fees from financial services increased primarily as a result of an increase in the number of mutual funds under management from in and in  to in as well as relatively high renewal rates of in  in and in profit margins improved from in and in to in margins in the financial services segment are expected to decline slightly in due to start up costs being incurred in connection with the mrm mutual funds and mrm life and on account of a revised executive incentive plan being implemented at hemisphere 
underwriting the company generally requires each corporate risk management client to indemnify it against an underwriting loss and the client normally provides collateral for at least the difference between the funds available in that client s account and the level of expected losses as actuarially determined by the company  although in certain circumstances the collateral level is below the level of expected losses 
the company faces a credit exposure in the event that losses exceed their expected level and the client is unable or unwilling to honor its indemnity to the company 
the company also faces credit exposure on both program and corporate risk business if its clients or brokers fail to pay the premium due and through failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations 
the company has established provisions for losses as a result of these exposures for certain clients and reinsurers 
these provisions  which totaled million at december   million in and million in  reduced the level of fee income in each year by million  
million and 
million respectively 
the increase in the number of accounts and their inherent growth in premium volume  the increase in the clients aggregate retentions since  the amounts recoverable from reinsurers which amounted to million at december  and million at december   in addition to competitive factors which have limited the amount of collateral that clients are willing to provide  have significantly increased the company s exposure to such losses 
the company evaluates the financial condition of its clients  brokers and reinsurers to minimize its exposure to losses from insolvencies 
premiums earned increased by in  and in  these increases are directly attributable to the shift in business from the corporate risk management segment to the program business segment and the strong growth within this segment 
program business usually involves higher premiums than business derived from the corporate risk management segment 
premiums earned represent the net premiums retained by the company on which it bears underwriting risk 
the company believes that both the volatility of underwriting profit or loss and the probability of experiencing a severe underwriting loss are less than would ordinarily be expected for a traditional property casualty insurer  due to the nature of the business written by the company and the structure of its reinsurance 
in the past  the level of premiums earned has been closely matched by the level of total insurance costs resulting in small amounts of underwriting loss as a percentage of premiums earned 
the fact that premiums earned are generally matched by total insurance costs means that even a significant fluctuation in premiums earned will have a relatively insignificant impact on the company s net income 
included in premiums earned are assigned risk premiums of million in as compared to million in and million in the underwriting losses associated with these assigned risk premiums  together with other charges imposed by certain states on voluntary insurers such as legion to support involuntary market losses residual market loads are passed on by legion to clients 
the company s principal exposure to underwriting loss exists in relation to the premium associated with the company s retention of a portion of the specific and aggregate excess risk on each client s account 
it is on this retained excess risk that the company may experience the most significant volatility in underwriting results 
the portion of the company s premiums earned which relate to this risk was million in as compared to million in and million in  representing  and of premiums earned in  and respectively 
the company incurred an underwriting loss of million in  
million in and million in as a result of the retained risk on its treaties and increases in acquisition expenses 
the company takes of the risk within the first million layer of the aggregate excess exposure on its main treaty up to a deductible amount equal to of the company s gross premiums as defined and of the risk over a loss ratio of  in the event that the loss ratio for the first layer exceeds the company takes no share of the risk in the layer million excess of million per account 
the maximum retention for specific excess losses is of 
million excess of 
million per occurrence 
on other treaties the company has decreased its exposure for excess losses 
investment income gross investment income increased by million or to million in from million in and million in as a result of increases in gross invested assets 
net investment income after adjusting for investment income which is payable to others increased by to million in from million in and million in net invested assets increased million or to million in from million in and million in the yield on these assets increased to from in and in the company s investment income is produced through the investment of its capital funds  long term debt  other funds held representing amounts due others and reserves held by the company for unearned premiums and unpaid losses 
the company carries million at december  and million at december  on its consolidated balance sheets as claims deposit liabilities 
these liabilities relate to loss obligations which  under sfas  are not classified as insurance 
investment income on these funds of million in  million in and million in  is credited directly to the claims deposit liability account 
the breakdown of expenses for each of  and is set forth in table iii 
table iii expenses year ended december  growth growth in thousands losses incurred    acquisition costs    total insurance costs    operating expenses    interest expense    other expense  total    the increases in total insurance costs were the direct result of the increases in premiums earned during these periods 
losses incurred increased as a direct result of the decreased use of large deductible policies  and the increase in program business 
the company discounts its specific and aggregate workers compensation reserves using a rate recommended under pennsylvania law where legion insurance is domiciled 
the net effect of this discounting was to increase net income after tax for the years ended december   and by 
million  
million and 
million respectively 
discounting also reduced net loss reserves by million  million and million at december   and the increase in acquisition costs from to is a direct result of the increase in premiums earned 
the decrease from to is attributable to a the fact that acquisition costs in all years include significant expenses associated with the involuntary workers compensation business the company is required to assume and over which it has no control 
such expenses have no net financial impact on the company as they are recharged to clients 
these expenses decreased in and b acquisition costs on large deductible policies are higher in relation to the associated premium than under a traditional guaranteed cost policy 
the volume of deductible programs written by the company decreased in the primary factors responsible for the increases in operating expenses were a the increased cost of administering the company s highly regulated policy issuing subsidiaries  as the volume of policies issued increased  b increased personnel costs in all areas  caused by an increase in the number of full time employees from in to in  resulting from the growth of the company s businesses as well as the impact of the company s growth in revenues and profits on employee bonus plans  and c the acquisitions of sbu and hugo trust as well as the expansion of puc into new york state 
the charges for income taxes represent effective tax rates of  and respectively 
the reduced tax rates experienced since are primarily due to increased earnings outside of the united states and the tax benefit derived from the exercise of employee stock options 
these factors plus the company s investment in tax exempt municipal securities  offset by state income taxes  are the major causes of the difference between the expected federal income tax rate in the united states of plus state income taxes and the company s effective rates in each year 
the legion companies  as insurance companies in the united states  are subject to income tax on an accelerated basis and  as a result  a deferred tax benefit was carried on the consolidated balance sheets of million in and million in liquidity and capital resources investments at december  the market value of the company s total marketable investments was million  as compared to million at december  in accordance with sfas  investments available for sale are reported at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses included as a separate component of shareholders equity 
these investments generally consist of investment grade fixed income securities which the company believes are readily marketable and could be liquidated to meet cash requirements  if necessary 
cash flow cash flow from operations has historically provided the company its principal source of liquidity 
the company has continued to produce a positive cash flow with million of cash provided from operations during  as compared to million in and million in the company believes that it will continue to maintain a positive cash flow from operations in the foreseeable future and will be able to meet its liquidity requirements 
excess cash flow from operations has principally been used in each year to increase the company s investment portfolio 
in october the company completed a private placement of zero coupon convertible exchangeable subordinated debentures due with a principal amount at maturity of million 
the net proceeds from the offering were million after expenses 
the debentures carry a yield of per annum and are convertible into common shares of the company per  principle amount at maturity or an aggregate of  common shares 
insurance operations at the end of and  and respectively  of the company s total marketable investments were held by the company s policy issuing subsidiaries in the united states 
these companies are restricted by regulation in the amount of dividends they can pay without prior regulatory approval to million in based on results and will continue to face these restrictions in the future 
during they paid a dividend of million 
they are also required to maintain certain deposits with or supply letters of credit to regulatory authorities which totaled million at december  million of deposits and million of letters of credit as compared to million at december  million of deposits and million of letters of credit 
a widely accepted factor used by regulators and rating agencies in evaluating insurance companies is the ratio of net premiums written to policyholders surplus which is an indication of the degree to which an insurer is leveraged 
because of the low level of net premiums written  they have produced a relatively low ratio on this basis of approximately in  in and in and should continue to produce relatively low ratios in the future 
the accepted industry standard for this ratio is below due to the nature of the company s operations  a more appropriate indication of leverage is the ratio of gross premium written to policyholders surplus  which amounted to in  in and in the national association of insurance commissioners naic has established that an unusual value for this ratio would be or higher 
the company has adopted a policy that this ratio should not exceed the naic has adopted a risk based capital rbc formula to be applied to all property casualty insurance companies 
the formula measures capital and surplus needs based on an insurance company s products and investment portfolio and is to be used as a tool to identify weakly capitalized companies 
an insurance company that does not meet the threshold rbc measurement standards could be required to reduce the scope of its operations and ultimately could become subject to statutory receivership proceedings 
at december  the company s policy issuing subsidiaries met the rbc requirements with a combined required risk based capital of million and an actual adjusted capital of million 
shareholders equity shareholders equity increased to million at december  from million at december  this increase was attributable primarily to net income in  less dividends paid  plus the value of shares issued on the exercise of employee stock options and the movement in unrealized gains and losses on investments 
the unrealized gain on investments was million at december   net of tax compared to 
million a year earlier 
this million change was a result of the changes in the market for fixed income securities 
during the total number of common shares outstanding increased to  from the level of  mainly as a result of the exercise of employee stock options 
total assets total assets increased to billion at december   a increase from billion at december  million  or of total assets  in and million  or  in related to assets held in separate accounts 
as detailed in note a to the consolidated financial statements  such assets are principally managed assets attributable to participants in the company s ipc programs 
inflation the company does not believe its operations have been materially affected by inflation 
the potential adverse impacts of inflation include a a decline in the market value of the company s fixed maturity investment portfolio  b an increase in the ultimate cost of settling claims which remain unresolved for a significant period of time  and c an increase in the company s operating expenses 
however  the company generally holds its fixed maturity investments to maturity and currently believes that an acceptable amount is included in the yield to compensate the company for the risk of inflation 
in addition  any increase from inflation in the ultimate cost of settling unpaid claims will be borne by the company s clients and offset by investment income earned for the benefit of the client during the period that the claim is outstanding 
finally  the increase in operating expenses resulting from inflation should generally be matched by similar inflationary increases in the client s premium and therefore the company s fee income which includes a fee based upon a percentage of the client s premium 
impact of year the company is modifying all software that is not year compliant 
the company is utilizing both internal and external resources to program or replace and test the software for year modifications 
the company anticipates that this exercise will be completed during and will not be a material cost  due to the fact that most systems are relatively new and were year compliant when purchased
