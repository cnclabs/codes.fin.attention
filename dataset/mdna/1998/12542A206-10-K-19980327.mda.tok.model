net earnings 

compared to net sales 
net sales increased billion  or  from billion in to billion in due principally to acquisitions and  to a lesser extent  internal growth 
of the increase in net sales  newly acquired subsidiaries including existing chs companies for the first nine months of which were integrated with companies acquired from merisel contributed billion 
net comparable sales of subsidiaries consolidated for both and grew million or 
this growth is attributed to increased consumer demand for microcomputer products offered by the company 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  from million in to million in due principally to acquisitions and  to a lesser extent  internal growth 
gross profit on a comparable basis for subsidiaries consolidated for both and increased million  or 
newly acquired subsidiaries including existing chs companies for the first nine months of which were integrated with companies acquired from merisel contributed million of increased gross profit 
gross margin increased from in to in the change in gross margin was due to increased early payment discounts and vendor rebates offset to some extent by lower gross margins of the recently acquired karma operations 
the company utilized more early payment discount opportunities as a result of the cash generated by its public equity offering in july additionally  the company s growth has resulted in more favorable volume rebates with certain key vendors 
the increase in gross margin attributable to early payment discounts and volume rebates was offset by the fact that the karma operation has a lower gross margin due to the nature of the products sold 
the company expects that gross margins will be lower than in due to the impact of having the karma operations included in the entire year and due to continued competitive pressures 
although the company has been achieving higher gross margins and in and  respectively in its eastern european operations than in other areas  the company expects gross margins in eastern europe to continue to decline due to increased competition and a company strategy to increase sales through more competitive pricing 
the company expects that the impact on gross profit due to decreased gross margins in this geographic area will be fully offset by increased sales 
operating expenses 
operating expenses as a percentage of net sales declined from in to in included were the expenses of maintaining a minimally utilized warehouse in the netherlands in and million in merisel restructuring expenses in in the warehouse is expected to be utilized for distribution of universal products eg  mass storage and components 
the comparative operating expense ratios without these items would have been for and for the company expects that the inclusion of karma s results for a full year will result in operating expenses being a lower percentage of net sales based on the lower operating expenses of karma 
operating expenses for both periods include the results of foreign currency transactions 
such results were a net gain of million in and million in net interest expense 
net interest expense increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase is directly related to the increase in average loan amounts outstanding 
income taxes 
income taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes and minority interest in subsidiaries decreased from in to in the change is due to a higher proportion of income earned in jurisdictions with lower tax rates and the use of net operating loss carryforwards  offset  to a certain extent  by losses in subsidiaries with no tax benefit and non deductible goodwill amortization 
the company expects to have an effective tax rate lower than the statutory united states tax rate in principally due to its ability to use remaining net operating loss carryforwards from certain subsidiaries and the proportion of income expected in jurisdictions with lower tax rates 
compared to net sales 
net sales increased million  or  from million in to billion in due principally to acquisitions and  to a lesser extent  internal growth 
of the increase in net sales  subsidiaries not included in both and contributed million 
net comparable sales of subsidiaries consolidated for both and grew million or 
this growth is attributed to increased consumer demand for microcomputer products offered by the company and the expansion of sales by the company s subsidiaries to include a full range of products 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  from million in to million in due principally to acquisitions and  to a lesser extent  internal growth 
gross profit on a comparable basis for subsidiaries consolidated for both and increased million  or 
subsidiaries not included in both and contributed million of gross profit 
gross margin decreased from in to in the decrease was due to lower gross margins from subsidiaries located in western europe  particularly those operations acquired from merisel  which  as a result of high volumes of sales by those entities  had a significant impact on the company s gross margin as a whole 
the company attributes the decrease in gross margins to competitive pressures in this region  especially in germany 
the company s subsidiaries in germany had the lowest gross margins of all its european subsidiaries in the company expects that overall gross margin may continue to decline in due to continued competitive pricing pressures and the fact that the gross margins of the acquired merisel companies have been generally lower than that of the company and will be included in the consolidation for the full year 
in addition  the acquisition of frank walter  which operates in germany  where gross margins are generally lower  will also impact overall gross margin 
the gross margin of the combined merisel companies for the nine months ended september  was 
operating expenses 
operating expenses as a percentage of net sales declined from in to in the decline was due to efficiencies gained through increased sales volume and the company s efforts to control costs 
the reduction was achieved even though a provision of million was made for restructuring costs incurred by chs consisting of severance costs for chs employees  write off of chs leasehold improvements and lease termination costs of chs closed facilities to implement consolidation in markets in which a chs company previously existed and a company was acquired from merisel 
the operating expense ratio without such charge would have been for the year 
net interest expense 
net interest expense increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase is directly related to the increase in average loan amounts outstanding 
income taxes 
income taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes and minority interest in subsidiaries increased slightly from in to in management does not believe this change is significant 
the difference between this tax rate and the statutory united states tax rate is due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and lower foreign tax rates  offset to some extent by losses in subsidiaries with no tax benefit and non deductible goodwill amortization 
seasonality the company typically experiences variability in its net sales and net income on a quarterly basis as a result of many factors  including the condition of the microcomputer industry in general  shifts in demand for software and hardware products and industry announcements of new products or upgrades 
sales in europe in the first and fourth quarters of each year are typically higher than in the second and third quarters 
in latin america  sales in the third and fourth quarters of each year are typically higher than in the first and second quarters 
liquidity and capital resources net cash of million and million was used in operating activities in the years ended december  and  respectively 
in both years  cash was used principally due to increases in inventories  trade accounts receivable and amounts due from affiliates  offset in by increases in accounts payable 
in  cash was also used to lower accounts payable and accrued expenses 
net cash used in investing activities in and included million and million  respectively  related to fixed asset additions 
in addition  million and million were used in acquisitions during the years ended december  and  respectively 
net cash of million and million was provided by financing activities in the years ended december  and  respectively  due principally to proceeds of equity public offerings totalling million in and million in furthermore  net borrowings from banks totalled million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
certain of the company s united states based subsidiaries are parties to a loan and security agreement providing for revolving credit advances and the issuance of letters of credit against eligible accounts receivable and inventory up to a maximum of million 
amounts outstanding bear interest  at the election of the borrowers  at either a variable market rate based on the prime rate of the lender or libor 
the agreement limits the ability of the borrowers to pay dividends to the company 
the agreement matures in october and is secured by a lien on essentially all of the borrowers assets 
the agreement contains certain restrictive covenants 
during november and december  the borrowers were in violation of requirements to deposit receipts in specified accounts 
the lender has waived these violations 
the company has guaranteed this indebtedness 
the company s subsidiaries typically enter into revolving credit agreements with financial institutions in their countries of operations 
at december   the aggregate amount available under these agreements was million and million was then outstanding 
such agreements are usually for a term of one year and are secured by the receivables of the borrower 
the weighted average interest rate at december  was 
the company typically guarantees these loans 
the company has also guaranteed the obligations of certain of its subsidiaries to manufacturers 
the company derives all of its operating income and cash flow from its subsidiaries and relies on payments from  and intercompany borrowings with  its subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet its obligations 
in certain countries  exchange controls may limit the ability of the company s subsidiaries to make payments to the company 
restrictions in financing or credit arrangements may also limit access to such earnings 
certain of the company s subsidiaries are parties to financing agreements that limit the ability of such subsidiaries to make payments to the company 
in the year ended december   the contribution of such subsidiaries to the company s consolidated ebitda was 
claims of creditors of the company s subsidiaries will generally have priority as to the assets and cash flow of such subsidiaries over the claims of the company or its creditors 
see note f to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has completed a risk assessment of the ability of its information systems to operate in light of the year problem 
based on the assessment  the company has developed an action plan  which principally consists of replacing existing non compliant systems with new systems 
the company believes it is feasible to acquire such new systems before the year and that the cost of such systems are within its capital cost budget and financing capabilities 
the company s principal need for additional cash in will be for the purchase of additional inventory to support growth and to take greater advantage of available cash discounts offered by certain of the company s vendors for early payment and to pay amounts due to sellers of businesses 
the company anticipates funding this cash requirement partially through the note offering  the new credit facility and its subsidiaries existing bank credit lines and through additional credit facilities  but there can be no assurance that financing will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
the unavailability of such financing could adversely affect the growth of the company 
inflation the company operates in certain countries that have experienced high rates of inflation and hyperinflation 
however  inflation did not have any meaningful impact on the company s results of operations during the year ended december  nor during the three year period ended december   and the company does not expect that it will have a material impact during asset management inventory 
the company s goal is to achieve high inventory turns and maintain a low number of skus and thereby reduce the company s working capital requirements and improve return on equity 
the company s strategy to achieve this goal is to both manage its inventory effectively and achieve high order fill rates 
to reduce the risk of loss to the company due to vendor price reductions and slow moving or obsolete inventory  the company s contracts with its vendors generally provide price protection and stock rotation privileges  subject to certain limitations 
price protection allows the company to offset the accounts payable owed to a particular vendor if such vendor reduces the price of products the company has purchased within a specified period of time and which remain in inventory 
stock rotation permits the company to return to the vendor for full credit  with an offsetting purchase order for new products  predetermined amounts of inventory purchased within a specified period of time 
such credit is typically used to offset existing invoices due without incurring re stocking fees 
accounts receivable 
the company manages its accounts receivable to balance the needs of its customers to purchase on credit with its desire to minimize its credit losses 
bad debt expense as a percentage of the company s net sales for each of the years ended and was 
the company s credit losses have been minimized by its extensive credit approval process and the use of credit insurance and factoring by its western european subsidiaries 
in its sales to customers in latin america  the company often receives post dated checks at the time of sale 
customers who qualify for credit are typically granted payment terms appropriate to the customs of each country 
currency risk management functional currency 
the company s functional currency  as defined by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 is the united states dollar 
most of the company s subsidiaries use their respective local currencies as their functional currency and translate assets and liabilities using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and results of operations using the average exchange rates prevailing during the year 
translation effects are reflected in the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment in equity 
the company s exposure under these translation rules  which is unhedged  may affect the carrying value of its foreign net assets and therefore its equity and net tangible book value  but not its net income or cash flow 
exchange differences arising from transactions and balances in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded as expense or income in the subsidiaries and the company and affect the statements of earnings 
hedging and currency management activities 
the company attempts to limit its risk of currency fluctuations through hedging where possible 
in the year ended december   a significant amount of the purchases of products by the company were made in united states dollars and approximately of company sales were made in currencies other than the united states dollar 
the primary currencies in which sales were made were the german mark of sales  the french franc and the british pound 
at december   approximately million of accounts payable were attributable to foreign currency liabilities denominated in currencies other than the subsidiaries functional currencies 
of these  million were denominated in united states dollars and million were denominated in german marks 
approximately of these liabilities were unhedged 
the most significant unhedged amounts were recorded in czechian korunas million  hong kong dollars million  polish zlotys million  argentine pesos million  and mexican pesos million 
chs finance  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  engages in central treasury functions including hedging activities related to foreign currency for the company and short term working capital loans to the company s subsidiaries to enable them to take advantage of early payment discounts offered by certain vendors 
these loans are denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing subsidiary or united states dollars 
generally  chs finance hedges its receivables denominated in currencies other than its functional currency  the swiss franc 
it attempts to limit the amount of unhedged receivables to an amount which approximates the total unhedged liabilities 
the company intends to review this policy periodically and may modify it in the future 
through both hedging activities coordinated by chs finance and subsidiary hedging activities  the company makes forward purchases of united states dollars in an attempt to hedge certain european currencies and reduce exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates 
additionally  in certain countries in eastern europe and in latin america where it is not practical to make forward purchases  to minimize exposure to currency devaluations  the company has adopted a policy of attempting to match accounts receivable with accounts payable and to limit holdings of local currencies 
in these countries  the company attempts to sell products at the united states dollar equivalent rate 
factors which affect exchange rates are varied and no reliable prediction methods are available for definitively determining future exchange rates 
in general  countries make an effort to maintain stability in rates for trade purposes 
there can be no assurance that these asset management programs will be effective in limiting the company s exposure to these risks 
new accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 comprehensive income in june sfas no 
requires that changes in the amounts of items that bypass the income statement and are only reported within a balance in shareholders equity be included in a separate financial statement 
the only item that qualifies as a component of comprehensive income currently bypassing the statement of income is the foreign currency translation adjustment 
sfas no 
becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company believes that the adoption of this standard will not have an effect on the company s financial position or result of operations
