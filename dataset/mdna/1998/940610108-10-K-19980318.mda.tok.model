fdicia established five capital tiers  ranging from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized 
a depository institution is well capitalized if it significantly exceeds the minimum level required by regulation for each relevant capital measure 
under fdicia  an institution that is not well capitalized is generally prohibited from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the prevailing rate in its market

banks deemed to be well capitalized and who pose the lowest risk to the bif will pay the lowest assessment rates  while undercapitalized banks  who present the highest risk  will pay the highest rates 
fdicia contained other significant provisions that require the federal banking regulators to establish standards for safety and soundness for depository institutions and their holding companies in three areas i operational and managerial  ii asset quality  earnings and stock valuation  and iii management compensation 
the legislation also required that risk based capital requirements contain provisions for interest rate risk  credit risk and risks of nontraditional activities

for the year ended december   noninterest income  excluding net gains on sales of securities  accounted for of gross revenue 
washington trust generates recurring noninterest income by charging for trust related services such as management of customer investment portfolios  trusts and estates  and by assessing fees for servicing deposit accounts  servicing residential mortgages sold in the secondary market  and processing merchant credit card activity 
revenue from trust related services continues to be the largest component of noninterest income 
trust revenue represented of noninterest income and amounted to million in  up by from the million reported in this increase in trust revenue is primarily attributable to the increase in assets under management  which amounted to million at december   up from million in service charges on deposit accounts rose to million in changes in the fee structures of various deposit products during the year  as well as growth in the corporation s total deposit base  were contributing factors in this increase

nonaccrual loans loans  with the exception of credit card loans and certain well secured residential mortgage loans  are placed on nonaccrual status and interest recognition is suspended when such loans are days or more past due with respect to principal and or interest 
well secured residential mortgage loans are permitted to remain on accrual status provided that full collection of principal and interest is assured 
loans are also placed on nonaccrual status when  in the opinion of management  full collection of principal and interest is doubtful 
interest previously accrued  but uncollected  is reversed against current period income 
subsequent cash receipts on nonaccrual loans are recognized as interest income  or recorded as a reduction of principal if full collection of the loan is doubtful or if impairment of the collateral is identified 
credit card loans remain on accruing status after becoming days or more past due  but are generally charged off after becoming days past due 
nonaccrual loans are returned to accrual status when the obligation has performed in accordance with the contract terms for a reasonable period of time and the ultimate collectibility of the contractual principal and interest is no longer doubtful 
included in accruing loans days or more past due at december  are residential mortgages amounting to thousand which are considered well collateralized and in the process of collection and therefore are deemed to have no loss exposure

these concessions include modifications of the terms of the debt such as reduction of the stated interest rate other than normal market rate adjustments  extension of maturity dates  or reduction of principal balance or accrued interest 
the decision to restructure a loan  versus aggressively enforcing the collection of the loan  may benefit the corporation by increasing the ultimate probability of collection 
included in nonaccrual loans at december   are loans amounting to million whose terms have been restructured 
there were no commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers whose loans had been restructured 
other real estate owned other real estate owned oreo is comprised of properties acquired through foreclosure and other legal means  and loans determined to be substantively repossessed 
a loan is considered to be substantively repossessed when the corporation has taken possession of the collateral  but has not completed legal foreclosure proceedings 
oreo is carried at the lower of cost or fair value minus estimated costs to sell

washington trust has provided financing to facilitate the sales of some of these properties 
financing is generally provided at market rates with credit terms similar to those available to other borrowers 
allowance for loan losses washington trust assesses the quality of its loans by performing ongoing reviews of its portfolio to determine potential loss exposure and to assess delinquency trends 
during this review  management gives consideration to such factors as overall borrower relationship  delinquency trends  credit and collateral quality  prior loss experience  current and expected economic conditions  and other pertinent factors

interest rate sensitivity and liquidity interest rate risk is one of the major market risks faced by the corporation 
the corporation s asset liability committee alco is responsible for establishing policy guidelines on acceptable exposure to interest rate risk and liquidity 
the objective of the alco is to manage assets and funding sources to produce results which are consistent with washington trust s liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk and profitability goals 
the alco establishes and monitors guidelines for proper origination and matching of assets and funding sources  and determines asset liability origination and pricing strategies to meet its goals 
the alco meets regularly to review the economic environment and the volume  mix and maturity of assets and liabilities  and implements appropriate changes in strategy that will manage the corporation s exposure to interest rate risk and liquidity risk 
the alco manages the corporation s interest rate risk using income simulation to measure interest rate risk inherent in the corporation s on balance sheet and off balance sheet financial instruments at a given point in time by showing the effect of interest rate shifts on net interest income over a month period 
the alco uses both parallel rate shocks of up to basis points and monte carlo rate simulations based on the historical volatility of interest rates to perform income simulations 
the simulations assume that the composition of the corporation s balance sheet remains constant over the month simulation horizon  and take into account the specific repricing  maturity  call options  and prepayment characteristics of differing financial instrument classes which may vary under different interest rate scenarios 
prepayment estimates for the corporation s loans are based on historical experience 
call options and prepayment characteristics for securities are calculated using industry standard pricing and prepayment analytics 
non contractual savings deposits are classified as short term three months or less for both maturity and repricing purposes 
the characteristics of financial instrument classes are reviewed periodically by the alco to ensure their accuracy and consistency 
the alco reviews simulation results to determine whether the negative exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates remains within established tolerance levels over a month horizon  and to develop appropriate strategies to manage this exposure 
as of december   net interest income simulation indicated greater negative exposure to falling interest rates to a degree that remains within tolerance levels established by the corporation 
the corporation defines maximum unfavorable net interest income exposure to be a change of no more than in net interest income over a year simulation horizon 
the following table summarizes the effect that interest rate shifts would have on net interest income for a month period using the corporation s on and off balance sheet financial instruments as of december  interest rates are assumed to shift by basis points over a month period  except for core savings deposits  which are assumed to shift by only basis points due to their historical insensitivity to rate changes 
further  core savings are assumed to have certain minimum rate levels below which they will not fall 
it should be noted that the rate scenario used does not necessarily reflect the alco s view of the most likely change in interest rates over the next months 
furthermore  since a static balance sheet is assumed  the results do not reflect the anticipated future net interest income of the corporation for the same period 
the following table presents these month net interest income simulation results dollars in thousands flat falling rising rates rates rates interest earning assets fixed rate mortgage backed securities    adjustable rate mortgage backed securities    callable securities    other securities    fixed rate mortgages    adjustable rate mortgages    other fixed rate loans    other adjustable rate loans    interest rate floor contracts net of premium amortization  total interest income    interest bearing liabilities core savings deposits    time deposits    short term borrowings    federal home loan bank advances    total interest expense    net interest income    the alco estimates that the negative exposure of net interest income to falling rates would result from historically smaller reductions in rates paid on deposits and increased cash flows from the corporation s mortgage loans and investment securities portfolio  which would be reinvested at lower marginal rates as rates fall  assuming a static balance sheet 
conversely  net interest income should increase as rates rise because adjustable rate assets will reset upward in yield  while rates paid on deposits would not rise to the same extent  based on historical experience 
while the alco reviews simulation assumptions to ensure that they are reasonable and current  income simulation may not always prove to be an accurate indicator of interest rate risk since the repricing  maturity and prepayment characteristics of financial instruments may change to a different degree than estimated 
in addition  since income simulations assume that the corporation s balance sheet will remain static over the month simulation horizon  the results do not reflect adjustments in strategy that the alco could implement in response to rate shifts 
the corporation also monitors the potential change in market value of its available for sale debt securities in parallel rate shifts of up to basis points 
the purpose is to determine market value exposure which may not be captured by income simulation  but which might result in changes to the corporation s capital position 
results are calculated using industry standard modeling analytics and securities data 
the corporation uses the results to manage the effect of market value changes on the corporation s capital position 
the following table summarizes the potential change in market value of the corporation s available for sale debt securities as of december  resulting from immediate basis point parallel rate shifts dollars in thousands falling rising rates rates security type us treasury and government sponsored agency securities noncallable   us government sponsored agency securities callable  corporate securities fixed rate mortgage backed securities adjustable rate mortgage backed securities   adjustable rate collateralized mortgage obligations  total change in market value of available for sale debt securities   during  the corporation purchased approximately million in securities primarily adjustable rate mortgage backed securities which reprice in one year or less to enhance net interest income and returns on equity 
these securities were match funded with approximately million in federal home loan bank advances 
the decision to match fund these purchases limits the impact on the corporation s interest rate risk profile by ensuring that repricing and cash flow characteristics of both assets and liabilities are similar 
interest rate risk exposure resulting from these purchases is incorporated in the corporation s interest income simulation and market value analyses 
the corporation also uses gap analysis to provide a general overview of the corporation s interest rate risk profile 
at december   the corporation s cumulative one year gap was a negative million  or of earning assets 
the following table details the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  that are expected to mature or reprice in each of the time periods presented 
to the extent applicable  amounts of assets and liabilities which mature or reprice within a particular period were determined in accordance with their contractual terms 
fixed rate mortgages  mortgage backed securities and consumer installment loans have been allocated based on expected amortization and prepayment rates using standard industry assumptions 
savings  now and money market deposit accounts  which have no contractual term and are subject to immediate repricing  are presented in the under three month category 
management believes that gap analysis has significant shortcomings as a measure of interest rate risk  as it does not address the effect of changes in interest rates nor the magnitude of resulting changes in net interest income 
for this reason  the alco does not use gap analysis to establish interest rate risk targets 
the following table summarizes the corporation s gap analysis as of december  dollars in thousands months to months to over or less months to year years years interest earning assets loans      debt securities      other   total interest earning assets      interest bearing liabilities deposits     short term borrowings  federal home loan bank advances      total interest bearing liabilities      interest sensitivity gap per period      cumulative interest sensitivity gap      cumulative interest sensitivity gap      the corporation supplements its interest rate risk management strategies with off balance sheet transactions 
such transactions are intended to hedge specifically identified risks inherent in the corporation s balance sheet  and not to produce speculative profits 
the corporation has written policy guidelines which designate limits on the notional value of off balance sheet transactions and require periodic evaluation of risks associated with these transactions  including counterparty credit risk 
during  the corporation entered into interest rate floor contracts with a notional principal amount of million and a five year term maturing in february these contracts are intended to function as a hedge against reductions in interest income realized from prime based loans 
these contracts were purchased for a premium of thousand  which is being amortized over the life of the contracts 
the corporation receives payment for these contracts if certain interest rates fall below specified levels 
during  the corporation recorded income  net of premium amortization  of thousand on its floor contracts

liquidity remained well within target ranges established by the alco during net loans as a percentage of total assets fell to at december   compared to at december  total securities as a percentage of total assets rose to at december   up from at december  these changes resulted primarily from planned growth related to the investment securities purchase program

proceeds from fhlb advances totaled million  while repayments of fhlb advances totaled million in additionally  million in deposits were generated primarily from branch expansion and growth of larger time deposits 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  the majority of which was used to purchase securities under the investment securities purchase program and for loan originations 
in addition  approximately million was used for additions to premises and equipment

litigation as discussed under note to the corporation s consolidated financial statements  the bank is party to a lawsuit filed by a corporate customer and the customer s shareholders for damages which the plaintiffs allegedly incurred as a result of an embezzlement by an officer of the customer 
the suit seeks recovery from the bank for losses directly related to the embezzlement of approximately million  as well as consequential damages amounting to approximately million 
management believes  based on its review with counsel of the development of this matter to date  that the bank has asserted meritorious defenses in this litigation 
additionally  the bank has filed counterclaims against the customer and its principal shareholder  as well as claims against the officer responsible for the embezzlement 
the bank intends to vigorously defend the suit  as well as to vigorously pursue its counterclaims 
because of the numerous uncertainties which surround the litigation  management is unable to estimate the amount of loss  if any  that the bank may incur with respect to this litigation 
consequently  no loss provision for this lawsuit has been recorded 
year compliance many existing computer programs use only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
this could cause many computer applications to fail or create erroneous results by or at the year the corporation is currently evaluating the extent to which modifications of its existing computer systems will be necessary prior to the year  as well as the ability of third party vendors to comply  in order to remain functional 
the corporation expects to complete the implementation of necessary modifications before the year and does not believe that the costs associated with these changes will have a material effect on the corporation s results of operations or financial condition
