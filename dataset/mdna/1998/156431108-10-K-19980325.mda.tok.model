item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by reference to  the consolidated financial statements of the company  including the notes thereto  appearing in item overview the company is an integrated manufacturer of primary aluminum and a broad range of value added and specialized flat rolled sheet and plate products 
the company s net sales are derived from the sale of primary aluminum and flat rolled sheet and plate aluminum products and from the tolling of primary aluminum and scrap into rolled products 
the company sells rolled products either directly to customers  in which case revenues and cost of goods sold include metal costs  or as a toll  in which case the customer provides the metal and the company s revenues and cost of goods sold do not include metal costs 
the aluminum industry is highly cyclical and the market price of primary aluminum which trades as a commodity is determined by worldwide supply and demand conditions  and as such  is highly volatile 
for example  the cash price for primary aluminum traded on the lme averaged  and per pound for the years   and  respectively 
in turn  prices of flat rolled sheet and plate aluminum products have reflected this volatility  as well as fluctuations attributable to general and industry specific economic conditions  which affect the company s volume and mix of sheet and plate products sold 
of the approximately million pounds of primary aluminum produced at the company s century of west virginia reduction facility in  the company utilized approximately million pounds for its rolling operations  with the balance sold primarily to the glencore group and third parties at market prices 
the company s interest in the mt 
holly facility amounted to approximately million pounds of primary aluminum production in during  glencore ltd 
purchased million pounds of primary aluminum that was produced at the mt 
holly facility 
century s remaining share of the mt 
holly facility production was sold to third parties 
the principal elements comprising the company s cost of goods sold are raw materials  energy and labor 
the major raw materials and energy sources used by the company in its production process are alumina  aluminum scrap  coal tar pitch  petroleum coke  aluminum fluoride and electricity 
the market price of alumina has been volatile from time to time 
from through  century purchased its alumina requirements from glencore ltd 
at variable prices tied to the market price of primary aluminum 
on july   century entered into a long term fixed price alumina supply contract with alcoa llc and alcoa australia 
pursuant to the supply agreement  since january   century has paid a fixed price for alumina  subject to fixed annual price increases of approximately through although the company produces the primary aluminum metal required by its rolling operations  it attempts to use as much aluminum scrap as possible through purchases in the open market to meet the total requirement of its rolling operations 
the market price for aluminum scrap closely follows the price of primary aluminum and has been subject to significant cyclical price fluctuations 
the company uses significant amounts of electricity in the aluminum reduction process 
to fulfill its power requirements at the century of west virginia facility  during the years and  and through june   the company purchased electricity from ohio power at a price based principally upon ohio power s costs of production 
under this agreement  century s price for electricity decreased if the lme primary ingot price was less than certain specified levels and increased  limited to the extent of cumulative net decreases  if the lme primary ingot price was greater than certain specified levels 
the company and the same public utility signed a power supply agreement  covering the period from july  through july  under this agreement  it will pay a fixed price for electricity used 
however  for the period from july  through july   if the lme primary ingot price were to exceed certain specified levels  the price for electricity used would increase  to the extent of cumulative net price decreases under the previous contract with the same utility 
since  under the terms of the new agreement  the power rate will be fixed  the company s margins could be adversely affected if aluminum prices decrease 
with respect to its labor costs  in  the company established a progress share plan for eligible union employees  providing for contributions of of century of west virginia s pre plan  after tax income as defined for each plan year through when the plan terminated
