item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview statements in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which express that the company believes  anticipates or plans to as well as other statements which are not historical fact  are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of actual events or results may differ materially as a result of the risks and uncertainties described herein and elsewhere including  in particular  those factors described under business and additional factors that might affect future results set forth in part i of this report as well as other risks and uncertainties in the documents incorporated herein by reference 
since commencing operations in april  arthrocare corporation the company has primarily engaged in the design  development  clinical testing  manufacturing and marketing of its arthroscopic system 
the arthroscopic system uses the company s novel coblation tm technology that allows surgeons to operate with increased precision and accuracy with minimal damage to surrounding tissue 
it is currently being used in closed joint surgery including many types of knee and shoulder procedures 
the arthroscopic system consists of a disposable  bipolar arthrowand  a radio frequency controller that powers the arthrowand and a cable that connects the arthrowand to the controller 
the arthrowand ablates removes soft tissue with minimal damage to surrounding healthy tissue and simultaneously achieves hemostasis sealing of small bleeding vessels 
after the close of the fiscal year  the company entered into a license agreement under which boston scientific corporation will develop and market products based on the company s coblation tm technology for myocardial revascularization procedures 
the company received clearance of its k premarket notification from the united states food and drug administration fda in march to market its arthroscopic system in the united states for use in arthroscopic surgery of the knee  shoulder  elbow and ankle 
the company has since received clearance for use in the wrist and hip 
in december  the company commercially introduced its arthroscopic system through a network of distributors in the united states 
in light of the for going  the company has a limited history of operations 
the company s strategy includes placing with arthroscopic surgeons  controllers that are intended to generate future wand revenues 
the company s long term strategy includes applying its patented platform technology to a range of other soft tissue surgical procedures 
the company has received k clearance for use of its technology in several fields and has received approval of an investigational device exemption ide to conduct a clinical study which may result in the company submitting a k application to the fda 
there can be no assurance that any of the company s clinical studies will lead to k applications or that the applications will be cleared by the fda on a timely basis  if at all  or that the products  if cleared for marketing  will ever achieve commercial acceptance 
results of operations the year ended january  was the company s second full year of product shipments 
the company was in its development stage during the comparable year ended december  arthrocare corporation statements of operations in thousands for the years ended january  december  december  net sales   cost of sales   gross margin  operating expenses research and development    sales and marketing    general and administrative    non recurring charge for acquired technology total operating expenses    loss from operations    interest and other expense  net   loss before income tax provision    income tax provision net loss    net sales revenues for the year ended january  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase was due to higher unit volume wand and controller sales resulting from controller promotional programs and a larger installed base of controllers 
the company was in its development stage during and shipped its first arthroscopic system in december revenues for the year ended december  were million 
the company s strategy has been and continues to be to increase future wand sales by increasing the installed base of controllers through aggressive promotional programs 
this strategy has and will continue to have an adverse impact on controller revenue and on gross margins  partially offsetting the positive impact of increased wand sales 
overall  wands were sold at or near list price during the years ended january  and december  the company expects to sell wands at discounted prices to international dealers in the future 
for the years ended january  and december  wands sales comprised the vast majority of revenues 
the company believes increased wand sales are a result of the company s strategic plan to build market share through continued promotional programs of controllers 
the company expects wand sales to remain the primary component of revenues in the future 
the company believes that  in its second full year of product shipments  it has penetrated to of hospitals that perform arthroscopic procedures in the united states and that more than half of the company s wand revenue is being generated by wands purchased for use in shoulder procedures 
the company believes that shoulder procedures are the fastest growing segment of the arthroscopic market and knee procedures represent the largest segment of the arthroscopic market 
in order to achieve increasing wand sales over time  the company believes it must further penetrate the market for knee procedures 
the company has introduced additional wand styles including its new turbo dome wands designed to be used in both knee and shoulder arthroscopic procedures 
in november  the company introduced its system controller designed for more aggressive ablation and hemostasis 
the company believes these features will increase wand sales in the market for knee and shoulder procedures 
in addition  the company has introduced wand styles for small joint and for capsular shrinkage procedures 
the new wand styles and the new system controller are intended to increase the market for the company s products 
there can be no assurance that the use of these new products will be adopted by doctors 
the company has limited sales and marketing experience and can make no assurance that current trends in sales and product acceptance will continue 
cost of sales cost of sales for the year ended january  was million  or of sales 
during the year ended december   cost of sales was million  or of sales 
the company was in its development stage during and shipped its first arthroscopic system in december cost of sales for the year ended december  was million 
the million increase in cost of sales for the year ended january  over the year ended december  was due to increased shipments of both wands and controllers 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased percentage points during the year ended january  as compared to the year ended december  resulting from the fixed and semi fixed costs being spread over higher manufacturing volume 
improvements to the manufacturing process also reduced costs by improving efficiency 
in the company made a strategic decision to manufacture its new system controller in house and introduced this new product in november while the shipments of system controllers did not have a material impact on controller cost or gross margin in the year ended january   the company believes it can reduce controller unit cost in the future by manufacturing the new controller in house 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve this objective 
the improvement in gross margin in includes the effect of the controller promotional programs 
the company believes that if its promotional programs maintain the same or higher number of wands bundled with a discounted controller  and if the demand for disposable wands increases over a growing installed base of controllers  then the cost of sales will continue to decrease as a percentage of sales and gross margins will continue to increase 
however  there can be no assurance the company will be successful in maintaining the mix of wands to discounted controllers in its promotional programs or in increasing demand for its disposable wands 
further  production of future new products may adversely impact gross margin due to the inefficiencies in manufacturing new products 
operating expenses research and development expense  which includes expenditures for regulatory compliance and quality assurance  increased to million for the year ended january  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase is attributed to the development and introduction of seven new wand styles and the system controller as well as the development and investigation of products suitable for additional markets 
this increase was partially offset by reduced spending for outside design and engineering services 
research and development expenses decreased or million during the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to the inclusion of manufacturing startup costs in research and development in the year ended december  when the company was in its development stage  as well as a non recurring charge of  in march  for acquired technology 
the company believes that continued investment in its platform technology is essential if it is to maintain its competitive position 
the company expects to continue increasing research and development spending through substantial expenditures on new product development  regulatory affairs  clinical studies and patents  although not at the rate seen in the past year 
the company believes that its ability to attract and retain qualified engineers in the future is critical to the continued success of the company 
sales and marketing expense increased to million in the year ended january  as compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase was primarily due to higher dealer commissions resulting from increased sales  higher staffing  and promotional and trade show expenses reflecting an increased level of sales and marketing activity 
sales and marketing expenses increased or million during the year ended december  as compared to million in the year ended december  when the company was in its development stage 
the increase was primarily due to dealer commissions and promotional  demonstration and sample expenses 
the company anticipates that sales and marketing spending will continue to increase due to higher dealer commissions from increased sales  the additional cost of penetrating international markets for the company s products  higher promotional  demonstration and sample expenses  and additional investments in the sales  marketing and support staff necessary to market its current products and commercialize future products 
general and administrative expense increased to million in the year ended january  as compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase is primarily due to the expense of attracting  recruiting and relocating a chief executive officer and increased staffing 
higher expenditures also include the cost of legal service  business development activities  insurance and expenses necessary to expand the corporate infrastructure 
general and administrative expenses nearly doubled to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  due to additional staffing including management personnel  the increased cost of being a public company  business development activities  consulting fees and expenses necessary to expand the corporate infrastructure 
the company expects that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase as a result of a patent litigation claim against certain competitors filed by the company after the close of the year  further expansion of its staff  and business development activities 
see part i  item of this report for a description of the patent litigation 
interest and other expense net interest income decreased slightly to million for the year ended january  as compared to million for the year ended december  the million decrease is attributable to the conversion of investments to cash for use in business operations during the year 
interest income increased million in fiscal from million for the year ended december  due to interest received on investment of the proceeds from the initial public offering of the company s common stock 
at the end of fiscal  the company had million in cash  cash equivalents  and available for sale securities which included long term available for sale securities as compared to million at the end of fiscal and million at the end of fiscal the company expects that interest income will decrease as the company reduces its investments to meet the future cash needs of the business 
net loss net loss remained unchanged at million for the years ended january  and december  during fiscal  sales doubled  gross margin grew four and a half times and operating expenses increased only 
the net loss of million for the year ended december  compares to million in the year ended december  the increased loss is due to higher operating expenses resulting from increased business activity including product development  manufacturing ramp up  higher dealer commissions  the sales and marketing expenses necessary to promote products and the building of corporate infrastructure 
the higher operating expense was partially offset by an increase in gross margin and higher interest income 
the company expects net losses to continue to decrease as sales increase faster than operating expenses and gross margin continues to improve 
however  there can be no assurance the company will be successful in its efforts to increase sales and gross margin or control the growth of operating expenses 
liquidity and capital resources at january  the company had million in working capital and its principal sources of liquidity consisted of million in cash  cash equivalents  and available for sale securities which include long term available for sale securities 
the cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid with original maturities of ninety days or less 
the company s cash used in operations increased to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended december  due to a higher inventory balance resulting from increased sales activity  the build up of controller component inventory in anticipation of volume  in house manufacturing of the new system controller and higher accounts receivable balances resulting from higher sales 
this was partially offset by higher accrued compensation due to increased staffing levels and higher accrued commissions due to increased sales 
cash used in operations during the year ended december  decreased slightly to million from million for the year ended december  reflecting higher accounts receivable  net loss  and inventory at the end of fiscal year  offset by higher accrued compensation  accounts payable and financial reporting expenses  and lower prepayments to a supplier of the company s inventory 
net accounts receivable increased to million as of january  from million as of december  accounts receivable were million as of december  the increase in accounts receivable between the fiscal years was due to sequentially increasing sales and the timing of sales within the last few months of the year 
inventories increased to million as of january  compared to million at december  due to higher product sales activity and higher parts inventory in anticipation of volume  in house manufacturing of the new system controller 
inventories were million at december  the increase in fiscal year was due to the higher level of product sales activity compared to the prior year during which the company began shipping product in december 
the company expects future inventory levels to grow both in absolute value and as a percentage of total assets as sales volume increases 
net property and equipment decreased to million as of january  compared to million at december  the slight decrease in fiscal was due to an increase in accumulated depreciation partially offset by the acquisition of capital equipment 
net property and equipment was million as of december  the increase in fiscal was primarily due to purchases of computer equipment  manufacturing equipment and machinery  and furniture and fixtures 
in  the company has planned but not committed to approximately million in capital expenditures 
on february  the company and boston scientific corporation bsc announced an agreement in which bsc will develop and market the company s proprietary coblation tm technology for use in myocardial revascularization 
under the agreement  bsc acquires exclusive licensing rights to the company s intellectual property in this field 
bsc will pay license fees  a portion of which will be classified as prepaid royalties  to the company upon achievement of designated milestones and royalties on sales of resulting products 
there can be no assurance the company and bsc will achieve the milestones required for the company to receive the license fees or that a product will be developed  cleared for marketing and achieve sufficient commercial acceptance for the company to receive royalties 
the company relies on computers and computer software to run its business as do its vendors  suppliers and customers 
these computers and computer software may not be able to properly recognize the dates commencing in the year the company has not completed an assessment of the impact this may have on its business and does not have a reasonable basis to conclude whether the impact of the year will or will not materially effect future financial results 
to date the company has not found any material impact which may result from the failure of its computers and computer software or that of its vendors  suppliers  and customers 
however  the company plans to make an assessment of this issue during and  if appropriate  develop an action plan to correct it 
the company plans to finance its capital needs principally from cash from product sales  cash  cash equivalents  and available for sale securities which include long term available for sale securities and related interest  existing capital resources and licensing arrangements which the company believes will be sufficient to fund its operations at least through fiscal year the company currently has no commitments for any credit facilities such as revolving credit agreements or lines of credit that could provide additional working capital 
the company s future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors including the company s success of commercializing the arthroscopic system  development and commercialization of products in fields other than arthroscopy  the ability of the company s suppliers to continue to meet the demands of the company at current prices  the cost associated with the company s ongoing patent litigation  obtaining and enforcing patents important to the company s business  the status of regulatory approvals and competition 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to raise additional capital or that such capital will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  reporting comprehensive income  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas establishes requirements for disclosure of comprehensive income and becomes effective for the company s fiscal year with reclassification of earlier financial statements for comparative purposes 
comprehensive income generally represents all changes in stockholders equity except those resulting from investments or contributions by stockholders 
sfas establishes standards for disclosure about operating segments in annual financial statements and selected information in interim financial reports and standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
this statement supersedes statement of financial accounting standards no 
 financial reporting for segments of a business enterprise 
the new standard becomes effective for the company s fiscal year  and requires that comparative information from earlier years be restated to conform to requirements of this standard 
the company is evaluating the requirements of sfas and sfas and the effects  if any  on the company s current reporting and disclosures
