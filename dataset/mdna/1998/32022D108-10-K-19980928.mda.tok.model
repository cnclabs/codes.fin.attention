the bank s liquidity ratio was at june  the bank s primary source of funds for meeting its liquidity needs are customer deposits  borrowings from the federal home loan bank of cincinnati  principal and interest payments from loans and mortgage backed securities  and earnings from operations retained by the corporation 
the bank also has a significant investment portfolio to meet liquidity should the need arise 
at june   the bank had outstanding loan commitments  including undisbursed portions of loans in process  standby letters of credit and lines of credit in the amount of million 
it is anticipated that these demands on liquidity will be net through growth in customer deposits and additional borrowings from the federal home loan bank of cincinnati

impact of inflation changing prices the financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation

as a result interest rates have a more significant impact on the bank s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
periods of high inflation are often accompanied by relatively higher interest rates and periods of low inflation are accompanied by relatively lower interest rates 
as market interest rates rise or fall in relation to the rates earned on the bank s loans and investments  the value of these assets decreases or increases respectively

item a 
disclosures about market risk to minimize the volatility of net interest income and exposure to economic loss that may result from fluctuating interest rates  the bank manages its exposure to adverse changes in interest rates through asset and liability management activities within guidelines established by its asset liability committee aloc 
the alco  which includes senior management representatives  has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with asset liability management policies of the corporation  which include managing the sensitivity repricing characteristics of the balance sheet components consistent with maintaining acceptable levels of changes in net portfolio value npv and net interest income 
a primary purpose of the corporation s alco is to manage interest rate risk to effectively invest the corporation s capital and to preserve the value created by its core business operations 
as such  certain management monitoring processes are designed to minimize the impact of sudden and sustained changes in interest rates on npv and net interest income 
the corporation s exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed on at least a quarterly basis by the board of directors and the alco 
interest rate risk exposure is measured using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine the corporation s change in npv in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates and interest rate sensitivity gap analysis is used to determine the repricing characteristics of the bank s assets and liabilities 
the table  presented on page  under item regulatory capital requirements  presents the corporation s projected change in npv for the various rate shock levels as of june  all market risk sensitive instruments presented in this table are held to maturity or available for sale 
the corporation has no trading securities 
npv is calculated by the corporation pursuant to guidelines estimated by the ots 
the calculation is based on the net present value of estimated discounted cash flows utilizing market prepayment assumptions and market rates of interest provided by independent broker quotations and other public sources as of june   with adjustments made to reflect the shift in the treasury yield curve as appropriate 
computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments  and deposits decay  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the alco could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of npv 
actual values may differ from those projections presented  should market conditions vary from assumptions used in the calculation of the npv 
certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  which represent one of the corporation s primary loan products  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the assets 
in addition  the proportion of adjustable rate loans in the corporation s portfolio could decrease in future periods if market interest rates remain at or decrease below current levels due to refinance activity 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in the npv 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to repay their adjustable rate mortgage loans may decrease in the event of interest rate increases 
another tool of evaluating the institution s sensitivity to net interest income to changes in interest rates is to examine the extent to which its assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
the following interest rate sensitivity table sets forth the bank s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at june   which are anticipated to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
interest rate sensitivity gap analysis as of june  dollars in thousands over total months months months years years years interest earning assets loans        debt and equity securities       mortgage backed securities  total rate sensitive assets        interest bearing liabilities money market deposits      passbook accounts        demand deposit accounts        certificates of deposit       borrowed funds    total rate sensitive liabilities        interest sensitivity gap        cumulative interest sensitivity gap       cumulative interest sensitivity gap as a percentage of total assets as the preceding table indicates  the bank has a moderate negative cumulative gap for assets and liabilities maturing or repricing within one year in the amount of  million or percent of total assets 
thus  decreases in interest rates during this time period would generally increase net interest income  while increases in interest rates would generally decrease net interest income 
however  even though the periodic gap analysis provides management with a method of measuring current interest rate risk  it only measures rate sensitivity at a specific point in time 
gap analysis does not take into consideration that assets and liabilities with similar repricing characteristics may not reprice at the same time or to the same degree and  therefore  does not necessarily predict the impact of changes in general levels of interest rates on net interest income 
additionally  certain assets such as adjustable rate mortgage loans have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of changes in interest rates  prepayment and decay rates may deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to afford the payments on their adjustable rate mortgage loans may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase
