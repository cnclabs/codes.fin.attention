the company seasonality and backlog the company s riddell and varsity operations are highly seasonal 
riddell group s historical operations in recent years have been most profitable in the second and third quarters  with losses occurring in the fourth quarter  and the varsity group s operations have also generated operating income in the second and third quarters of each calendar year with offsetting losses each first and fourth quarter 
accordingly  the second and third calendar quarters have become the most important to the company s profitability 
this seasonal pattern is expected to continue 
orders for competitive football products and reconditioning services are solicited over a sales cycle that begins in the fall of each year at the end of the football season and continues until the start of football play at the end of the following summer 
delivery of competitive football products and performance of reconditioning services reach a low point during the football playing season 
these activities contribute most to profitability in the first through third quarters of each calendar year 
riddell s sports collectible products are sold to retailers throughout the year 
however  sales are at their peak during the third and fourth quarters as retailers build inventory in anticipation of both the football and the holiday shopping seasons 
varsity s spirit business and the results of its operations are highly seasonal 
varsity s cheerleader and dance team camps are held exclusively in the summer months and sales of uniforms and accessories occur primarily in the six months prior to the beginning of the school year 
a substantial portion of varsity s annual revenues and all of varsity s net income are generated in the second and third quarters of the calendar year  while the first and fourth quarters have historically resulted in net losses 
the selling season for competitive products sold by riddell s direct sales force to schools and other institutional customers is well into its annual sales cycle  and order backlog for these product lines at march  was million  a increase over comparable march  backlog of million 
the competitive product increase was more than offset by a decrease in order backlog relating to orders for retail sports collectible products  resulting in an overall decline in backlog 
the selling cycle for sports collectible products has only recently begun and  accordingly  retail backlog levels at march are not necessarily indicative of sales levels which may occur for the full calendar year 
combining the competitive and retail products businesses and the spirit business  backlog for the company at march  was approximately million  a decrease of million from march  backlog of approximately million 
governmental regulation riddell s products and accessories are subject to the federal consumer product safety act  which empowers the consumer product safety commission the cpsc to protect consumers from hazardous sporting goods and other articles 
the cpsc has the authority to exclude from the market certain articles which are found to be hazardous and can require a manufacturer to repurchase such goods 
the cpsc s determination is subject to court review 
similar local laws exist in some states and cities in the united states  canada and europe 
riddell maintains a quality control program for its protective equipment operations and retail products that is designed to comply with applicable laws 
to date  none of the company s products has been deemed to be hazardous by any governmental agency 
at present  no national governing body regulates cheerleading and dance team activities at the collegiate level 
although voluntary guidelines relating to safety and sportsmanship have been issued by the ncaa and some of the athletic conferences  to date cheerleading and dance teams are generally free from rules and restrictions similar to those imposed on other competitive athletics at the college level 
however  if rules limiting off season training are applied to cheerleading and or dance teams similar to rules imposed by the ncaa on certain sports  it is likely that varsity would be unable to offer a significant number of its camps either because participants would be prohibited from participating during the summer or because enough suitable sites would not be available 
although the company is not aware of any school officially adopting these activities as a competitive sport  recognition of cheerleading and or dance teams as sports would increase the possibility that cheerleader or dance activities may become regulated 
if varsity were restricted from providing its training programs to colleges and high schools  or if cheerleaders and dance teams were restricted from training during the off season  such regulations would likely have a material adverse effect on varsity s business and operations 
however  the company currently does not believe that any regulation of collegiate cheerleading or dance teams as a sport is forthcoming in the foreseeable future  and in the event any rules are proposed to be adopted by athletic associations  the company expects to participate in the formulation of such rules to the extent permissible 
at the high school level  some state athletic associations have classified cheerleading as a sport and in some cases have imposed certain restrictions on off season practices and out of state travel to competitions 
however  in all cases to date  varsity has been able to work with these state athletic associations to designate acceptable times for the cheerleaders within these states to attend camps 
varsity has also signed agreements with several state associations to assist with sponsoring and executing official competitions within these states 
to date  state regulations have not had a material effect on varsity s ability to conduct its normal business activities 
each of riddell s and varsity s operations at all of its facilities are subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health agency and various other regulatory agencies 
the company s operations are also subject to environmental regulations and controls 
while some of the raw materials used by riddell may be potentially hazardous  it has not received any material environmental citations or violations and has not been required to spend significant amounts to comply with applicable law

product liability proceedings and insurance as part of its ongoing business  riddell is routinely a defendant in various product liability law suits arising from personal injuries allegedly related to the use of riddell helmets 
insurance riddell maintains product liability insurance under a program initiated in december in january  the company and its insurer restructured this insurance program replacing the existing policy with a new policy  extending coverage through january  three years beyond the previous policy term and providing reduced annual fixed cost with no material change in the scope of coverage 
the policy is an occurrence based policy providing coverage against claims currently pending against the company and future claims relating to injuries occurring between december and january even if such claims are filed after the end of the policy period 
the insurance program provides certain basic and excess coverages with combined aggregate coverage of over  subject to the limitations described below 
the basic insurance coverage under the policy provides coverage of up to  per claim in excess of an uninsured retention deductible of  per occurrence basic coverage 
the basic coverage  which does not affect the availabilty of the excess coverage described below  has an aggregate limit which is currently  but the policy allows the company to increase this maximum limit to  at any time by prepaying the required premium  which counts at of the amount paid toward the limit 
the insurance program also provides for additional coverage excess coverage of up to  per occurrence  in excess of the first  of each claim which is covered by the basic coverage  to the extent available 
claims covered by the excess coverage are subject to one of two separate  aggregate policy limits  depending on the date of the related injury 
the first  aggregate limit applies to claims for injuries occurring prior to january  and claims occurring after january  are covered under the second separate  aggregate limit 
the company s product liability insurance carrier is a division of american international group  inc  which has been rated a xv by am best property and casualty insurance rating company 
there is no certainty that coverage will remain available to the company after or that the insured amounts will be sufficient to cover all future claims 
each of riddell and varsity carries general liability insurance with coverage limits which the company believes are adequate for its business 
product liability proceedings riddell has historically been a defendant in product liability personal injury suits allegedly related to the use of football helmets manufactured or reconditioned by subsidiaries of the company  including suits relating to helmets made by bsn corp 
s helmet division prior to its acquisition by riddell in as of march   six product liability cases were pending against riddell 
the company has established reserves for pending product liability claims and determines its reserves based on estimates of losses and defense and settlement costs which it anticipates would result from such claims based on information available at the time the financial statements are issued 
due to the uncertainty involved with estimates  actual results have at times varied substantially from earlier estimates and could do so in the future 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the ultimate costs of these claims or potential future claims will fall within the established reserves

varsity s operations now comprise the company s spirit segment and include the design and marketing of cheerleader and dance team uniforms for sale to the school spirit industry and the operation of high school and college cheerleader and dance team camps  clinics and special events 
in transactions related to the acquisition  the company issued million of senior notes  sold approximately million of its common stock to certain key managers of varsity  entered into a new working capital credit facility and repaid certain other long term debt 
the acquisition significantly increased the size of the company s business 
on a pro forma basis  revenue for the company combined with varsity was million in and million in  more that twice the company s historical stand alone revenues for the year before the acquisition 
also in the company settled certain litigation unrelated to product liability which had been ongoing for several years  resulting in a curtailment of the high levels of legal expenses relating to these actions 
the company s operating results for the year ended december  include varsity s operating results from the date of acquisition  not the full year 
since operating results for the company include only this partial year of varsity s operations and operating results do not include any of varsity s operating results  the and operating results are not comparable and are not indicative of the combined operations of the company on a going forward basis 
to assist in overcoming this limitation this presentation includes a comparison of certain pro forma operating results for and to supplement the comparison of actual results 
as used in this discussion  the pro forma results are on the basis described and presented in note of the consolidated financial statements and include varsity s preacquisition results together with certain pro forma adjustments 
operations for the year resulted in a net loss on both an actual and pro forma basis 
on an overall basis  those portions of the company s operations  in both its historical sports products segment and the recently acquired spirit segment  which sell to schools and other institutional customers through the riddell and varsity direct sales forces demonstrated improvements in revenues and operating income for the year 
this revenue improvement was offset to some degree and  as a result  the operating income improvement was more than offset by declines from the company s line of retail sports collectibles sold through retail channels and its youth sports products which are sold through dealers 
in response to these results the company has recently hired new management for the retail product lines and shifted the primary method of distributing youth sports products toward direct marketing using the company s in house sales force 
pro forma year ended december  compared to pro forma year ended december  pro forma revenues pro forma revenues for the year ending december  increased million  or  to million from million in pro forma revenues from the company s spirit segment  acquired in the acquisition  increased to million in from million in this improvement reflected an increase in sales of uniforms and accessories of million  or  in comparison to  as well as growth in the number of camp participants which contributed to an increase in camp and event revenues of million or over levels 
revenues generated by the company s sports product and trademark licensing segments are discussed below in the comparison of actual and results 
pro forma gross profit pro forma gross profit for was million  an increase over pro forma gross profit of million for pro forma gross profit from the company s spirit segment  acquired in the acquisition  increased million  or  for to million from million in pro forma gross profit for the spirit segment was reduced by million of charges stemming from a revaluation of inventory in june and included in varsity s preacquisition results 
pro forma gross margins were also impacted by increased freight and overtime costs incurred in the segment s uniform and accessory business in order to overcome certain production delays which occurred during the year 
gross profit generated by the company s sports products and trademark licensing segments is discussed  below  in the comparison of actual and results 
pro forma selling  general and administrative expenses on a pro forma basis  selling  general and administrative expenses for were approximately million  an increase over pro forma expenses of for pro forma selling  general and administrative expenses for the company s spirit segment  acquired in the acquisition  increased million for to million from million in this increase is generally due to increases in variable expenses associated with increased sales volume 
the pro forma expenses also include the impact of a non cash charge of million relating to in the money riddell stock options contractually granted to certain varsity employees as further discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements and a charge of million stemming from a revaluation of receivable reserves in june and included in varsity s preacquisition results 
the segment s pro forma selling  general and administrative expenses also reflect start up costs associated with co 
dance  a new venture in the private dance studio market 
selling  general and administrative expenses incurred by the company s historical operations are discussed below in the comparison of actual and results 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  comparison of actual results revenues total revenues for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  this increase included revenues from the recently acquired varsity operations of million for the period from the june acquisition through december  net sales of the company s sports products segment increased million  or under  to million in from million in the company achieved a gain in sales to its institutional customers while experiencing offsetting declines in its other product lines  as further discussed in the following paragraphs 
sales of athletic products and services sold to schools and other institutions by the riddell in house sales force  which comprised approximately of the revenues from the company s historical sports products segment for  increased approximately million  or  over levels 
the company benefitted from initial sales of its newly introduced line of athletic practice clothing and continued to experience volume gains in most of its core football protective product lines and reconditioning services 
the company experienced a decrease in sales of collectible products sold to retailers  youth athletic products sold through recreational dealers and  to a lessor extent  products sold internationally 
sales for these product lines decreased an aggregate of million  or  from levels 
the company believes that the principal reasons for the declines in sales of retail collectible products related to the timing of new product introductions and industry wide cautiousness in making inventory commitments for licensed sports products 
as part of a restructuring of its consumer products group  early in the company replaced the head of its retail group and filled the sales manager position which had been vacant since july while sales of youth products had increased somewhat in  the decrease represents the continuation of a trend that started in late  when the company changed its method of distribution for institutional products  replacing independent dealers with its direct sales force 
at that time it left recreational youth products exclusively with the dealer network and anticipated sales declines in youth products as dealers de emphasized the company s products in reaction to the company s withdrawal of institutional products from dealers 
because of the decline in sales of youth products the company decided to change its principal means of distributing these products and in late began to sell youth products to recreational teams and organizations on a direct basis 
youth products will also continue to be offered to recreational team dealers and distributors 
sales of youth products constituted of the company s revenues in this change in distribution strategy could lead to lower youth product sales to dealers which may or may not be offset by direct sales 
royalty income from trademark licensing in decreased by  or million 
the company recognized gains in macgregor royalties from kmart and royalties from its riddell apparel and sock licenses 
these gains were offset by royalty declines due to the expiration of a macgregor license with thom mcan which had generated million in prior years and the cessation of royalty receipts from the company s riddell footwear licensee 
as described elsewhere in this report  the company has assigned certain future royalties from its riddell footwear licensee  for up to ten years  to other parties to settle certain litigation 
while the license has recently been transferred to a new licensee  the assignment remains in place 
the company has derived a significant portion of its royalties from licensing the macgregor trademark to kmart under an arrangement which expires in mid royalty income generated from this license was approximately million in the company has renewed the footwear portion of this license  which represented approximately of royalties under the license  for an initial term ending june  on substantially the same terms 
kmart has indicated that it will not be renewing the sports apparel portion of the license  which also has generated approximately of royalties under the license 
discussions on the renewal of the remaining smaller categories which include socks and athletic bags have not reached a conclusion 
the company intends to seek a new licensee to replace kmart for macgregor sports apparel  as well any other category not renewed  after the kmart license expires

gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  increased to million from million for this increase included gross profit from the recently acquired varsity operations of million for the period from the acquisition date through december  gross profit from the company s sports products segment  which does not include the operations acquired from varsity  decreased by million to million for from million in related gross margin rates decreased to of sales for from of sales for the decline in gross profit and gross margin rates was due to several factors 
first  the decline in sales of retail sports collectibles discussed above heavily impacted gross profit and the margin rate as these products carry higher than average margins 
in addition  sales of practice wear  which increased during the periods as discussed above  also diluted gross margins as expected 
margins on practice wear  which normally carry a lower margin than the company s historical product lines  were also negatively impacted during by start up costs of related screen printing operations and introductory pricing 
also  while institutional reconditioning business volume increased  margins for this product line were down due to higher costs associated with the initial year of reconditioning work on equipment from new customers gained during the year and an increase in material and parts usage 
the company believes that gross margin rates could decline in future periods due to its strategy of introducing new products  although such decreases would not likely be as large as the decrease in pro forma margin rates experienced in which included the other causes discussed above 
new product introductions may include products which carry lower margins than the average of the company s other products and the company is likely to incur start up costs on new product lines as they are introduced 
margins could also be negatively impacted in future years if growth of newer lower margin products exceeds the growth of product lines with higher margins 
while trademark licensing does have certain costs including selling  general and administrative expenses  there are no costs which are deducted in arriving at gross profit 
accordingly  any increase or decrease in royalty income results in a corresponding increase or decrease in gross profit 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expense increases reflect expenses from the recently acquired varsity operations of million for the period from the acquisition date through december  selling  general and administrative expenses from the company s historical operations increased  or million  to million for from million in the year to date increase in expenses is largely attributable to increased legal expenses related to various litigation exclusive of product liability matters that were resolved during as discussed elsewhere in this report 
total litigation expense related to these litigation matters amounted to million for and million these litigation matters were settled in  curtailing the high levels of legal expenditures relating to these actions 
interest expense interest expense for increased significantly over levels due to the costs of additional debt incurred to finance the varsity acquisition and the inclusion of a million onetime charge relating to the commitment fee for bridge financing that had been obtained as part of the transactions surrounding the acquisition 
the increase in debt incurred to finance the acquisition  as further discussed below  will have a continuing impact on interest expense in future periods 
income taxes tax expense for both and was reduced by the benefit of net operating loss carryforwards recognized in those years 
the recognition of these tax benefits had the effect of decreasing tax expense by approximately million in and million in the company anticipates that any remaining unrecognized tax benefit for financial reporting purposes would be phased out upon the generation of approximately million in future pre tax income and adjustments 
the goodwill recorded in connection with the varsity acquisition will generate approximately million in annual amortization charges that are not deductible for income tax purposes during future years 
this increase in the level of permanent differences between income computed for financial reporting purposes and for income tax purposes will have the effect of increasing the company s effective tax rate in future years 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  overview the discussion of operations for in comparison to is based on the reported results for the company and do not include any pro forma impact of the operations acquired from varsity in operations for the year ended december  resulted in a increase in net income to million or per share on a diluted basis  in comparison to earnings of million or per share on a diluted basis  before an extraordinary item 
an extraordinary item in consisted of a million charge to establish a provision for costs related to certain fraudulent transfer litigation 
at the time the provision was established  a settlement had been agreed to between the parties but this litigation was not settled until  as discussed elsewhere in this report  and was settled under an agreement different from the one anticipated at the time the provision was recorded 
in the company benefitted from increased sales volume over most of its product lines which  combined with a favorable sales mix  improved the company s gross margins from sales of sports products 
these gains were offset by a decrease in royalties from trademark licensing and an increase in selling costs 
revenues net sales of the company s sports products segment increased by in to million from during the company experienced sales gains in most of its product lines  including overall increases in sales of athletic products  sports collectible products and reconditioning services 
sales of competitive athletic products increased approximately million  or  in comparison to levels 
sales of these products  principally football helmets and shoulder pads sold to schools and other institutions  reflect increased volume and selected price increases to offset rising costs 
unit volume increases occurred as the company gained experience in direct distribution of institutional products 
the company also benefitted from other actions taken to increase institutional sales 
these actions included increases in the number of salesmen calling on schools  more intensive sales training  incremental field sales managers  new sales incentive programs  and the introduction of additional athletic products 
in spite of continuing de emphasis by the company s historical independent dealers  sales of youth products increased in as the company expanded its distribution 
the company experienced an anticipated decline in sales of these products in as many dealers stopped purchasing riddell youth products when they were no longer offered the company s institutional product lines 
sales of reconditioning services increased  or approximately million over comparable levels 
this improvement was principally due to moderate price increases 
sales of sports collectible products increased approximately  or million over levels 
this improvement was due to increased volume in sales of the company s line of miniature helmets

royalties from the licensing of the riddell trademark decreased from approximately million in to approximately million in the decline was principally due to two previously announced events which took place near the end of first  the company terminated a license for certain athletic equipment due to the licensee s failure to pay royalties 
secondly  the company revised the terms of a license for riddell branded leisure apparel in conjunction with the related licensee s restructuring of its product lines

other factors contributing to the improvement in gross margins were changes to the sales mix  efficiencies due to higher volumes and selective price increases taken to offset rising costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or over levels 
these increases are attributable to higher levels of selling  marketing and promotional expenses relating to the company s sales of competitive athletic products sold to schools and other institutions 
these selling expense increases were incurred in taking certain actions to increase sales of competitive athletic products as discussed under revenues  above 
these increases in selling expenses were offset in part by a decline in administrative expenses with the end result that overall selling  general and administrative expenses remained relatively stable as a percentage of revenues  decreasing to of revenues in from of revenues in interest expense interest expense was relatively stable between the two years with an overall decrease of approximately 
an overall decrease in average interest rates was offset  in part  by increases in average indebtedness relating to increased levels of overall business volume 
a substantial portion of the company s borrowings were based on its bank s prime rate  which averaged in  a decrease from an average rate of in average interest rates also decreased as a result of the company s issuance of a  convertible subordinated note in november the majority of the proceeds of this note were used to repay indebtedness which carried higher interest rates

the company considers licensing revenues derived from the macgregor trademark rights to be a material part of its business 
a material decline in the royalties from the macgregor trademark rights could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
furthermore  if there were a material decline in the revenues from the macgregor trademark  then the carrying amount of the macgregor trademark rights could be deemed to have been impaired 
a write down for such impairment could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
year issues the company uses computer systems across its business  and like virtually all companies and organizations  is faced with the task of addressing the year issue over the next two years 
the year issue relates to the possibility that computer systems may not be able to properly process data which utilizes dates after december  the company has been engaged in a program to assess and correct related problems in existing systems or  in the case of a system otherwise slated for replacement  to obtain a new system which is year compliant 
in this regard  the company has incurred expenses for year remedial programs of approximately  in and anticipates that costs will remain at this level over the next year  exclusive of the cost of the new system being procured 
the cost of the new system is not expected to impact capital expenditures beyond the level generally experienced over the past two years  on a pro forma basis 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram or replace and test systems for year compliance 
the company plans to complete its year compliance program by early and believes that completion of the program can mitigate its year issues 
however  the issues involved are full of complexities and uncertainties  and if all required modifications and conversions are not identified and completed on a timely basis  the year issue could result in a material impact on the company 
while the company believes it is taking all appropriate steps to become year compliant  it is dependant on customer  vendor and other third party compliance to a large extent 
while the company has had communications with certain customers and suppliers on this issue  the diversity of its customer and supplier base make it impracticable to determine the full extent to which the company may be vulnerable to those third parties failures to remediate their own year issues 
there can be no guarantee that the systems of customers  vendors and other companies will be timely converted and that failure to convert would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
liquidity and capital resources changes in debt structure in order to finance the varsity acquisition  the company issued million of senior notes due and entered into a new credit facility for a million five year revolving line of credit 
see note of the consolidated financial statements 
overall  the costs of the acquisition and the financing used approximately million of cash  net of million of gross proceeds from newly issued stock sold to certain key employees of varsity 
the remaining million of proceeds from the issuance of the million senior notes  together with draws under the new revolving line of credit  were used to repay debt consisting of a million term note with interest at prime plus   of subordinated notes due to certain shareholders and approximately  of other notes payable which had been discounted at and to refinance and reduce the company s and varsity s existing lines of credit 
all of the company s preexisting long term debt was repaid except for its million of convertible subordinated notes 
the company incurred debt issue costs of approximately million in connection with the senior notes and approximately million of costs in connection with the new credit facility 
these costs will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the related debt 
the senior notes and the new credit facility impose certain covenants on the company  including covenants limiting the amount of additional indebtedness the company may incur  its ability to engage in future acquisitions  its ability to sell assets and apply proceeds from them and the amount of dividends the company may declare and pay 
the covenants in the new credit facility also require the company to maintain specified financial ratios and meet specified financial tests  all of which may impose limitations on the company s future liquidity 
capital expenditures combined capital expenditures for the company and varsity totaled approximately million in and million in working capital seasonality and liquidity the company has historically sold a significant portion of its competitive football products and reconditioning services on dated payment terms to its customers primarily high schools and colleges 
accordingly  trade receivables increase throughout the year as sales are made on these dated payment terms 
the increase in trade receivables continues throughout an annual cycle until reduced at the end of the cycle as the dated receivables become due  generally in the following july to october period 
in order to finance the resulting receivable levels  the company has maintained a revolving line of credit 
the outstanding balance on the revolving line of credit generally follows the seasonal receivable cycle described above  increasing as the level of receivables increase until the midsummer of each year when collections of the dated receivables begin and are used to reduce the outstanding balance 
the recently acquired operations of varsity follow a similar pattern 
varsity s slow season runs from the fourth quarter and last into the second quarter  a period in which varsity generates lower levels of revenue while incurring expenditures in preparation for its approaching business season 
working capital demand reaches a peak in the middle of the second quarter 
varsity has historically repaid these borrowings by early in the third quarter as its collections begin to pick up in june with the start of camp and continues at a seasonally high level through the fall of each year as many of its receivables are collected from the sale of uniforms and related goods 
there were no outstanding borrowings at december  under the company s new credit facility which matures in and provides for seasonal borrowings under a revolving line of up to million  dependant on certain levels of receivables and inventories 
the company anticipates that it will need to modify certain financial covenants contained in its credit facility during based on the company s relationship with its lenders and recent discussions  the company believes that it will be able to obtain the necessary modifications to its credit facility  although there can be no such assurance that this will be the case 
in addition to the historical seasonality of the company s businesses  the company expects that its new debt structure will impact the seasonality of its working capital demands as the semi annual interest payments on the million of senior notes come due each january and july 
there are no principal payments due on the senior notes until they mature in as a result of the financing transactions associated with the varsity acquisition discussed above  the company s debt service obligations have increased significantly 
the ability of the company to meet its debt service and other obligations will depend on its future performance and is subject to financial  economic and other factors  some of which are beyond its control 
however  the company believes that operating cash flow together with funds available from the line of credit under the credit facility will be sufficient to funds its debt service and seasonal and other working capital requirements in the foreseeable future
