item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is a specialty finance company offering asset based financing to healthcare providers  with a primary focus on clients operating in sub markets of the healthcare industry  including long term care  home healthcare and physician practices 
from its inception in september  through the year ended december   the company principally originated finance receivables through advances against accounts receivable 
advances against accounts receivable were characterized by high and varying yields  as a result of the differing terms of the transactions negotiated with individual clients 
the yield on finance receivables generated through advances against accounts receivable was during the year ended december   and during the year ended december  by december   the finance receivables originated through revolving lines of credit secured by accounts receivable had grown to of finance receivables in the company s accounts receivable program  as the company focused its marketing efforts on larger balance  prime rate based revolving loans to more creditworthy borrowers 
revolving lines of credit are characterized by lower overall yields than advances against accounts receivable  but provide the company with the opportunity to expand its range of potential clients while reducing costs as a percentage of finance receivables 
as a result  the company s overall yield on finance receivables in the accounts receivable program  which was for the year ended december   declined to for the year ended december  during  the company expanded its stl program to increase its penetration of targeted healthcare sub markets 
through the stl program  the company serves clients that have more diverse and complex financing needs  such as healthcare facility acquisitions and expansions 
in addition to the collateral securing the loans  the company generally has recourse to the borrower 
stl program loans generally have terms of one to three years 
as a result of the company s expansion of the stl program  loans under that program comprised of finance receivables at december  the yield on finance receivables under the stl program for the year ended december  was 
while yields on stl program loans are generally lower than the yields generated from the accounts receivable program  some stl program loans also include warrants and other fees that may enhance their effective yields 
the company has implemented a program designed to ensure that all software used by the company in connection with its services will manage and manipulate data involving the transition of dates from to without functional or data abnormality and without inaccurate results related to such data 
the company does not anticipate that execution of this program will have a material effect on its operating results 
however  the company believes that some of its clients and payors may not have implemented such programs 
the failure by clients and payors to implement necessary software changes may disrupt client billing and reimbursement cycles and adversely affect clients cash flow and collectability of pledged accounts receivable 
the company is unable to predict the effects that any such failure may have on the financial condition and results of the operations of the company 
the company is a delaware corporation which was organized in april  and commenced its business in september  until september  the company s name was healthpartners financial corporation 
on that date its corporate name was changed to healthcare financial partners  inc the reorganization prior to the company s initial public offering the offering  the company conducted its operations principally in its capacity as the general partner of healthpartners funding  lp a former partnership  funding and del 
management concluded that the company s future financial position and results of operations would be enhanced if the company directly owned the portfolio assets of each of these limited partnerships and the transactions described below the reorganization were effected by the company prior to or simultaneously with the offering 
effective as of september   funding acquired all of the net assets of del  consisting principally of finance receivables  for  in cash  which amount approximated the fair value of del s net assets 
following the acquisition  del distributed the purchase price to its partners and was dissolved 
the purpose of this transaction was to consolidate the assets of del and funding in anticipation of the acquisition by the company of the limited partnership interests of funding described below 
effective upon completion of the offering  the company acquired from healthpartners investors  llc hp investors  the sole limited partner of funding  all of the limited partnership interests in funding and paid the million purchase price for such assets from the proceeds of the offering 
such purchase price represented the limited partner s interest in the net assets of funding and approximated both the fair value and book value of the net assets 
funding was subsequently liquidated and dissolved  and all of its net assets at the date of transfer  consisting principally of advances made under the accounts receivable program  were transferred to the company 
in connection with the liquidation of funding  farallon capital partners  lp farallon and rr capital partners  lp rr partners  the only two members of hp investors  exercised warrants for the purchase of an aggregate of  shares of common stock acquired on december  for an aggregate payment of  which represented the fair value of the warrants at that date 
no additional consideration was paid in connection with the exercise of the warrants 
hp investors transferred the warrants to farallon and rr partners in contemplation of the liquidation of funding

during the year ended december   the company increased its client base from clients to clients in its accounts receivable program  and from clients to clients in its stl program 
additionally  average borrowings from the company increased by in as compared to the prior year 
yield on finance receivables declined from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december  as a result  the increase in fee and interest income was due to growth in the volume of finance receivables 
the yield on finance receivables for the year ended december  was lower because the composition of the company s finance receivable portfolio contained a greater percentage of lower yielding stl program loans and a lower percentage of higher yielding advances against accounts receivable in its accounts receivable program 
interest expense increased from million for the year ended december  to million in however  the company s average cost of borrowed funds decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense was the result of higher average borrowings required to support the company s growth 
because of the company s overall growth in finance receivables  net fee and interest income increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increased interest expense from increased borrowings  combined with a lower yield on finance receivables  resulted in a decrease in the annualized net interest margin from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the company s provision for losses on receivables increased from  for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was attributable to an increase in outstanding finance receivables  which is among the factors considered by the company in assessing the adequacy of its allowance for losses on receivables 
the company experienced no credit losses in either period 
operating expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   a increase 
this increase was the result of a increase in compensation and benefits due to hiring additional personnel  as well as increases in other operating expenses  all relating to the expansion of the company s operations 
other income increased from  for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was mainly attributable to the company receiving fees from clients for legal services performed by in house personnel 
these fees were previously paid by the clients but passed through to the outside firm that performed the services 
net income increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   a increase  primarily as a result of the overall growth in the company s finance receivables described above

the increase principally resulted from an increase of million in average finance receivables outstanding due to the company s introduction of revolving lines of credit secured by accounts receivable during the last quarter of and a corresponding increase of million in such revolving lines of credit secured by accounts receivable from december  to december  interest earned from revolving lines of credit secured by accounts receivable increased from  for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   which accounted for million of the million growth in total fee and interest income between the periods 
during the year ended december   the company increased its client base with respect to advances against accounts receivable from clients to clients 
additionally  existing clients increased their average borrowings from the company in as compared to the prior year 
because the yield on finance receivables declined markedly from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december   the increase in fee and interest income was due to growth in the volume of finance receivables  and was somewhat offset by the decline in yield 
the yield on finance receivables for the year ended december  was lower due to a substantially greater volume of revolving lines of credit secured by accounts receivable outstanding during the year ended december  which have lower yields when compared to advances against accounts receivable 
interest expense increased from  for the year ended december  to million for however  the company s average cost of borrowed funds decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  this increase in interest expense was the result of higher average borrowings required to support the company s growth

subsequent to march  the company increasingly relied on borrowed funds to finance its growth 
because of the company s overall growth in finance receivables and increased leverage  net fee and interest income increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increased interest expense from increased borrowings  combined with a lower yield on finance receivables  resulted in a significant decrease in the annualized net interest margin from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december the company s provision for losses on receivables increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this increase was attributable to an increase in outstanding finance receivables and an increase in the company s average client balances  which are among the factors considered by the company in assessing the adequacy of its allowance for losses on receivables

client holdbacks the company s primary protection against credit losses on its accounts receivable program is the excess collateral  which consists of client accounts receivable due from third party payors which collateralize revolving lines of credit secured by  and advances against  accounts receivable 
the company obtains a first priority security interest in all of the client s accounts receivable  including receivables not financed by the company 
as a result  amounts loaned or advanced to clients with respect to specific accounts receivable are cross collateralized by the company s security interest in other accounts receivable of the client 
with respect to revolving lines of credit secured by accounts receivable  the company will extend credit only up to a maximum percentage  ranging from to  of the estimated net collectible value of the accounts receivable due from third party payors 
the company obtains a first priority security interest in all of a client s accounts receivable  and may apply payments received with respect to the full amount of the client s accounts receivable to offset any amounts due from the client 
the estimated net collectible value of a client s accounts receivable thus exceeds at any time balances under lines of credit secured by such accounts receivable 
with respect to advances against accounts receivable  the company purchases a client s accounts receivable at a discount from the estimated net collectible value of the accounts receivable 
the company will advance only to of the purchase price which is equal to aggregate net collectible value minus a purchase discount of any batch of accounts receivable purchased 
the excess of the purchase price for a batch of receivables over the amount advanced with respect to such batch a client holdback is treated as a reserve and provides additional security to the company  insofar as holdback amounts may be applied to offset amounts due with respect to the related batch of client receivables  or any other batch of client receivables 
as is the case with the revolving lines of credit  the company obtains a first priority security interest in all of the client s accounts receivable 
in addition  under both programs the company frequently obtains a security interest in other assets of a client and may have recourse against personal assets of the principals or parent company of a client 
under the stl program  the company s term loans to clients are secured by a first or second lien on various types of collateral  such as real estate  accounts receivable  equipment  inventory and stock  depending on the circumstances of each loan and the availability of collateral 
turnover the company s results of operations are affected by its collections of client accounts receivable 
the company s turnover of its finance receivables in its accounts receivable program  calculated by dividing total collections of client accounts receivable for each of the following quarters by the average month end balance of finance receivables during such quarter  was x for the quarter ended march   x for the quarter ended june   x for the quarter ended september   x for the quarter ended december   x for the quarter ended march   x for the quarter ended june   x for the quarter ended september  and x for the quarter ended december  for the year ended december   the company s turnover of its finance receivables in its accounts receivable program was x  as compared to x for the year ended december  provision and allowance for losses on receivables the company regularly reviews its outstanding finance receivables to determine the adequacy of its allowance for losses on receivables 
to date  the company has not experienced any credit losses 
the allowance for losses on receivables is maintained at an amount estimated to be sufficient to absorb future losses  net of recoveries  inherent in the finance receivables 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance  management of the company considers trends in healthcare sub markets  past due accounts  historical charge off and recovery rates  credit risk indicators  economic conditions  on going credit evaluations  overall portfolio size  average client balances  excess collateral  real estate collateral valuations  and underwriting policies  among other items 
as of december   the company s general reserve was million or of finance receivables  at december   it was million or of finance receivables 
to the extent that management deems specific finance receivable advances to be wholly or partially uncollectible  the company establishes a specific loss reserve equal to such amount 
at december  and  the company had no specific reserves 
in the opinion of management  based on a review of the company s portfolio  the allowance for losses on receivables is adequate at this time  although there can be no assurance that such reserve will be adequate in the future 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows resulting from operating activities provided sources of cash amounting to million for the year ended december  this compares to pro forma operating cash flows of million and million for and  respectively 
the most significant source of cash from operating activities is derived from the company s generation of net fee and interest income from its finance receivables  and the more significant uses of cash from internal operating activities include cash payments for compensation and employee benefits  rent expense  and professional fees 
as the company s number of clients and resulting business opportunities have grown  the company has primarily used cash in the acquisition of finance receivables under its accounts receivable and stl programs 
the company s financing activities have provided the necessary source of funds for the acquisition of receivables 
financing has been obtained from both debt and equity sources 
the debt financing has been generated from draws on the bank facility  the warehouse facility and the sale of commercial paper through the cp facility 
the sources of equity financing were primarily from limited partner capital contributions prior to the reorganization and the offering and the secondary offering 
subsequent to the offering  the limited partnership interest was purchased using a significant portion of the offering proceeds  the limited partnership was dissolved and its assets transferred to the company 
in conjunction with the reorganization and in contemplation of the offering  at the request of the company  fleet increased the committed line of credit under the bank facility from million to million 
the bank facility is a revolving line of credit 
the interest rates payable by the company under the bank facility adjust  based on the prime rate of fleet national bank fleet s prime rate  however  the company has the option to borrow any portion of the bank facility in an integral multiple of  based on the one month  two month  three month or six month libor plus 
as of december  and  and million  respectively  was outstanding under the bank facility 
the bank facility contains financial and operating covenants  including the requirement that the company maintain an adjusted tangible net worth of not less than million and a ratio of total debt to equity of not more than to in addition  under the bank facility the company is not allowed to have at any time a cumulative negative cash flow as defined in the bank facility in excess of million 
the inter creditor arrangements entered into in connection with the cp facility excludes borrowings under the cp facility from debt for purposes of calculating the debt to equity ratio 
at december  and  the company was in compliance with all of its covenants under the bank facility 
the expiration date for the bank facility is march   subject to automatic renewal for one year periods thereafter unless terminated by either party which requires six months prior written notice 
in december   the company entered into an agreement with ing for million commitment under the cp facility 
on december   that commitment was increased to million 
as of december   million of commercial paper was outstanding under the cp facility 
as of december   million of commercial paper was outstanding under the cp facility 
the cp facility requires the company to transfer advances and related receivables under its accounts receivable program which meet certain criteria to a bankruptcy remote  special purpose subsidiary of the company 
the special purpose subsidiary pledges the finance receivables transferred by the company to holland limited securitization inc  a commercial paper conduit which is an affiliate of ing the conduit 
the conduit lends against such pledged assets through the issuance of commercial paper 
the cp facility generally requires the maintenance of a minimum overcollateralization percentage of 
under the cp facility  ing can refuse to make any advances in the event the company fails to maintain a tangible net worth of at least million 
at december   the company was in compliance with all of its covenants under the cp facility 
the maturity date for the cp facility is december  however  the cp facility may be terminated by the company at any time after december   without penalty 
see business capital resources 
on june   the company entered into an agreement with first boston under the warehouse facility 
under the terms of the warehouse facility  the company is able to securitize certain loans under the company s stl program 
the company had a total borrowing capacity under the agreement of million as of december  in january  that commitment was raised to million and in february  to million 
as of december   the company had borrowed million under the warehouse facility 
the warehouse facility requires that the amount outstanding under the financing agreement may not exceed of the principal amount of the stl program loans securitized 
interest will accrue under the financing agreement at a rate of libor plus on the first million and on the second million 
the warehouse facility requires that the loans advanced by the company do not exceed of the appraised value of the real estate  or a multiple of the underwritten cash flow of the borrower  that the weighted average yield of advances under the warehouse facility must exceed the prime rate of interest plus  that the maximum weighted average loan to value of advances under the warehouse facility must be no greater than  and that no loan in the portfolio has a life greater than five years 
additionally  the warehouse facility requires that  to the extent that the company makes advances in amounts greater than million to any borrower  that excess is advanced by the company through other sources 
the commitment to make advances under the warehouse facility terminates on june  subsequent to that date  no new loans may be securitized under the existing agreement  however previous loans securitized will remain outstanding until they have been fully repaid 
additionally  under the terms of the agreement  the company has the right to repurchase any assets securitized at a price equal to the fair market value of such assets 
at december   the company was in compliance with all of the covenants of the agreement 
the company requires substantial capital to finance its business 
consequently  the company s ability to grow and the future of its operations will be affected by the availability and the terms of financing 
the company expects to fund its future financing activities principally from i the cp facility  which expires on december   ii the bank facility  which expires on march   subject to automatic renewals for one year periods thereafter unless terminated by either party and iii the warehouse facility  which expires on june  in addition  on february   the company announced its intention to file a registration statement for an offering of million shares of its common stock 
while the company expects to be able to obtain new financing facilities or renew these existing financing facilities and to have continued access to other sources of credit after expiration of these facilities  there is no assurance that such financing will be available  or  if available  that it will be on terms favorable to the company 
interest rate sensitivity interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in interest spread between the yield on the company s portfolio and the cost of funds necessary to finance the portfolio ie  the bank facility  the cp facility and the warehouse facility resulting from changes in interest rates 
to the extent that interest income and interest expense do not respond equally to changes in interest rates  or that all rates do not change uniformly  earnings are affected 
the interest rates charged on revolving lines of credit secured by accounts receivable adjust based upon changes in the prime rate 
the fees charged on advances against accounts receivable are fixed at the time of any advance against a batch of receivables  although such fees may increase depending upon the timing of collections of receivables within the batch 
the interest rates on the company s term loans generally adjust based on the prime rate 
the interest rates payable by the company under the bank facility adjust  based on fleet s prime rate  however  the company has the option to borrow any portion of the bank facility in an integral multiple of  based on the one month  two month  three month or six month libor plus 
the interest rate on the cp facility adjusts based upon changes in commercial paper rates 
because the company finances most of the accounts receivable program s activity through the cp facility  there exists some interest rate risk since the interest rate on advances to the company s clients under the accounts receivable program will adjust based on the prime rate  and the interest rate on most of the company s liabilities under the cp facility will adjust based on commercial paper rates 
such limited interest rate sensitivity on the accounts receivable program portfolio is not expected to have a material effect on the company s net interest income if interest rates change 
additionally  because advances against accounts receivable are generally fixed and financed with the cp facility  which has rates that adjust with changes in commercial paper rates  there exists interest rate sensitivity with respect to advances against accounts receivable  and if interest rates increase significantly  such an increase could have an adverse effect on the company s net interest income 
however  this interest rate sensitivity is mitigated by the fact that i advances against accounts receivable comprise only of the finance receivables in the accounts receivable program as of december   and ii the company does not make long term commitments with respect to advances against accounts receivable and therefore  retains substantial flexibility to negotiate fees based on changes in interest rates 
inflation inflation has not had a significant effect on the company s operating results to date
