overview the company s net loss for was  and its loss attributable to common stockholders was  or per basic and diluted common share  on net sales of  the net loss is primarily attributable to increased expenses generated by the company s technology segment 
the difference between the net loss and the loss attributable to common stockholders resulted from preferred stock dividends and accretion and the conversion discount on preferred stock 
on december   the company sold its mec and lsia subsidiaries to vision in a transaction which was effective as of december  under the company s ownership  mec was a vision managed care company which managed vision care programs for health maintenance organizations hmos and other insured enrollees and lsia was a physician practice management company which managed the ophthalmic practice known as nnjei under a management services agreement 
the company received million in cash paid at the closing and  unregistered shares of vision common stock vision shares  subject to certain post closing adjustments 
see recent developments liquidation of vision shares 
although the amount of post closing adjustments could be as much as  the company estimates  as of march   that the amount of such adjustments will be approximately  this estimate is subject to change and reflects the anticipated effect of the following the company is required to reimburse vision for operating profits for the month of december generated by mec and lsia  negative working capital as of november  of mec and lsia less than negative  if any  and negative net worth as of november  for mec and lsia  if any 
in addition  if prior to december  vision does not enter into certain practice management agreements with nnjei and an affiliated physician  or absent such agreements  if the benefits vision derives from existing practice management agreements for the period ending december  is less than  then the company is required to reimburse vision for such shortfall on a dollar for dollar basis up to a maximum of  in an amendment to form k filed with the securities and exchange commission the sec on march   vision disclosed that the physicians currently employed by nnjei have threatened to discontinue providing professional services effective march  results of operations net sales

the increase in health care services revenue was primarily attributable to increased revenues generated by mec an increase of  and lsia an increase of  offset by a substantial reduction in revenues generated by tfg 
of the total net sales and revenues for  mec  lsia and tfg accounted for revenues of  of total revenues   and   respectively 
net sales for tfg for the year ended decreased by  from the same period in this decrease was due primarily to a reduction in consulting services provided and was accompanied by a total expense reduction  including costs of services  of  for the year ended such revenue decrease is primarily a result of that subsidiary s primary revenue producer  michael r 
farris  being named as president of the company in late  eliminating his day to day participation in the consulting business 
other consultants employed were unable to maintain revenues at historical levels 
the increase in revenues generated by mec resulted from new contracts entered into during and increased enrollments in existing contracts 
the increase in revenues generated by lsia in is primarily a result of lsia being acquired in july the increase in revenues generated by the company s technology subsidiary is primarily attributable to the phasing out of the ls laser system which had a lower selling price than the laserscan and lsx 
forty six laser systems were sold during compared to systems  net of returns  sold the company s ability to sell the new lsx into certain european countries is limited until the system receives ce mark certification  which is anticipated sometime in mid technology revenues include the impact of sales returns in see the next paragraph and one system return in based upon the expected timing of increased availability of the lsx  the company expects laser system sales to remain at levels for the first quarter of  with moderately increased sales levels thereafter 
vs 
the increase in health care services revenue was primarily attributable to revenues generated by the company s acquisitions of mec on october  and of the assets of nnjei on july   partially offset by a reduction in tfg s revenues of relative to this decrease was due primarily to a reduction in consulting services provided 
during the third quarter of  the company reduced the number of tfg s personnel in anticipation that revenues would continue below historical levels 
of the total net sales and revenues for  mec  tfg and lsia accounted for revenues of  of total revenues   and   respectively 
of tfg s total revenues   were intercompany revenues which have been eliminated in the company s consolidated financial statements 
lsia s revenues reflect a six month period 
the higher revenues generated from health care services were offset primarily by a decrease in revenues of technology products and services during the decrease in revenues generated by the company s technology subsidiary was primarily attributable to i a decrease in the number of laser systems sold in overseas markets in  ii a higher allowance for sales returns  reflecting differences between actual experience and previously estimated amounts  and iii a lower average system selling price in although a total of laser systems were sold in compared to systems sold in  laser systems were returned in compared to one system returned in through the first quarter of  certain of the company s sales contracts included provisions for returns over periods ranging from one to months 
such provisions did not result in any material laser system returns through the end of in the second quarter of  the company ceased sales of systems with return rights 
based on the passage of time  the company does not believe it faces significant exposure for future returns of systems 
the decrease in laser system sales from levels was also the result of the company s revised credit policy  which established more stringent criteria for acceptable sales terms 
in addition  due to competitive pressures in certain markets and the company s introduction of the lower priced ls laser system in june  the average sales price  net of commissions  declined by approximately from average levels 
included in the first quarter of were non recurring revenues from the sale of revenue rights from procedure fees at six surgical centers located in china in the amount of  the financial impact of systems sold in and returned in in excess of previously estimated amounts was approximately million  broken down as follows net revenues were decreased by million  offset by reductions in corresponding cost of sales million and commissions and warranty related costs million

the gross profit margin decrease was attributable to i a significant increase in mec revenues with a corresponding increase in provider payments  which historically have ranged from approximately to of mec revenues  and ii a general increase in the operating costs of the company s costa rican manufacturing facility due to the doubling of leased space and higher than average compensation increases paid to costa rican employees due to the competitive environment for engineers in that area  the costs of which are allocated entirely to cost of goods sold 
the gross profit margin decrease was mitigated in part due to a substantial increase in revenues generated by lsia 
costa rican operating expenses are not expected to increase materially without a significant increase in the level of systems sold 
vs 
the gross profit margin decrease was attributable to i a full year s activity of mec which  in  operated at a gross profit percentage of which the company believes is above average for the managed care industry  ii a lower average sales price for laser systems sold in  iii the additional allowance for sales returns  and iv the sale of the company s future revenue rights for six laser systems in china for  in after removing revenues from the sale of revenue rights in and all health care services revenues from and consolidated sales and revenues  the gross profit margins and gross profit margin were  and  respectively  in and  and  respectively  in research  development and regulatory expenses 
the following table presents a three year comparative analysis of research  development and regulatory expenses 
change change research  development and regulatory    as a percent of technology net sales research  development and regulatory expenses increased by  between and such expenses increased by  between and vs 
the increase can primarily be attributed to ongoing research and development of new scanning refractive laser systems  including development of the lsx and add on features for the laserscan  and continued software development for the laser systems 
additionally  the company has incurred increased costs related to the fda regulatory process  both for its own scanning laser system the pma application for which was filed in march  and the lasik laser system for which the company purchased the rights to manufacture and commercialize if fda approval is received 
additional costs have been incurred in the clinical and manufacturing validation of the a d k 
increased commercial production and shipment of the lsx is anticipated during the second quarter of since the initial announcement of the development of the lsx  the company has solicited and received input from clinical users and prospective customers 
this has resulted in modifications to the system  necessitating additional development and testing for clinical validation 
as a result of a continuation of the efforts described  the company expects research  development and regulatory expenses during the first two quarters of to remain at levels consistent with those incurred in the latter part of the company does not anticipate expenses overall to exceed levels 
regulatory expenses may increase as a result of the company s continuation of current fda clinical trials  protocols added during related to the potential use of the company s laser systems for treatment of glaucoma  the possible development of additional future protocols for submission to the fda and the lasik pma acquired in july vs 
the increase can primarily be attributed to ongoing research and development of new refractive laser systems  including refinements to and accessories for the laserscan  and continued software development for the excimer lasers 
regulatory expenses increased as a result of the company s approval from the fda to proceed with phase b clinical trials for myopia and phase a clinical trials for park and the development of additional protocols for possible future submission to the fda

the following table presents a three year comparative analysis of selling  general and administrative expenses 
change change selling  general and administrative    as a of net sales selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  in from such expenses increased by  in from vs 
the primary reasons for these increases include the continued growth of mec  increased amortization costs resulting from acquired patents  license agreements and other intangibles  additional provisions for uncollectible accounts  and a general increase in personnel costs necessary to fund the strategic initiatives of the company and the development of its products and services 
such strategic efforts include enhancements to field service  engineering and software development departments  the pursuit during of vision managed care contracts with hmos  insurers and employer groups  the ibm patents and the a d k license 
additionally  lsia began operations in july  resulting in six months of expenses being included in operations and representing increased expenses of  during these increases were partially offset by the substantial reduction in the operating costs of tfg 
legal and accounting expenditures continue to be incurred as a result of ongoing regulatory filings  general corporate issues  litigation and patent issues 
vs 
the primary reasons for these increases include increased employment and other operating costs as a result of the acquisition of mec in october and its subsequent growth  the acquisition of the assets of nnjei in july  and a general increase in personnel and costs necessary to fund the strategic initiatives of the company and the development of its products and services 
the relationship of such expenses to revenues suffered during as a result of the lower average selling price for laser systems  the additional allowance for sales returns  and the decrease in tfg revenues 
without the impact of sales returns  total selling  general and administrative expenses would have totaled approximately million and represented of net sales

see recent developments liquidation of vision shares 
vs 
the decrease in operating results can be attributed primarily to the decrease in net sales of the company s laser systems  the higher than estimated level of laser system returns  and the loss incurred by tfg 
additional contributing factors included an overall increase in expenses  including research and development  regulatory and selling  general and administrative expenses  including resources devoted to the development of the company s business strategies 
other income and expenses

the improved operating results in were primarily the result of increased sales of the company s laser systems  the profitability of the health care services companies  and non recurring gains 
earnings loss per share 
earnings loss per basic and diluted common share decreased to in from in the decreases in are attributable to the larger net loss incurred and accretion and dividend requirements on the redemption in october of  the company s series b convertible participating preferred stock  
par value the series b preferred stock issued in august of the basic and diluted losses per share in  and  respectively  were a result of the value of conversion discount on preferred stock in accordance with eitf topic d and accretion and dividend requirements on the series b preferred stock 
weighted average shares outstanding increased in as a result of the conversion of eight shares of series a preferred stock into common stock  the amendment to the purchase agreement related to lasersight centers  the issuance of shares under the earnout provisions of the acquisition of tfg  the issuance of shares in conjunction with the acquisition of rights to a pma and keratome patent  and the exercise of options 
the decreases in were attributable to the net loss incurred and dividends on the series a preferred stock issued in january of the basic and diluted losses per share in  and  respectively  were a result of the value of conversion discount on preferred stock in accordance with eitf topic d  and and  respectively  were a result of dividends on the series a preferred stock 
in  earnings per share grew at a slower rate than net income  primarily because of a significant increase in weighted average shares outstanding on a basic basis and on a diluted basis 
the increases were largely the result of a placement of common stock in early  exercises of outstanding stock options and grants of additional stock options  shares issuable pursuant to the tfg acquisition agreements and shares issued in connection with the mec acquisition in the fourth quarter 
for purposes of computing basic and diluted earnings per share   shares of common stock that were issuable pursuant to an earnout based on the pre tax performance of tfg have been included in weighted average shares outstanding for both and liquidity and capital resources working capital 
working capital increased  from  in to  in this increase resulted primarily from an increase in cash and cash equivalents and marketable equity securities resulting from the sale of two of the company s subsidiaries 
see recent developments liquidation of vision shares 
sources and uses of funds 
operating activities used net cash of  in  compared to  used in this increase is primarily attributable to higher net loss compared to the net loss in and the sale of two of the company s subsidiaries 
these items were partially offset by an increase in amortization and depreciation costs and increases in accounts payable  accrued expenses and income tax accounts 
net cash used in investing activities was  in compared to  of net cash provided by investing activities during and net cash used of  in net cash used in investing activities during can be primarily attributed to the acquisition of certain patents and license agreements from ibm and others  the purchase of office and computer equipment  and the purchase of a vision managed care contract  partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of two of the company s subsidiaries and proceeds from the exclusive licensure of such patents 
net cash provided by investing activities in can be primarily attributed to the proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction offset by the acquisition of the assets of nnjei and the purchase of office and computer equipment and leasehold improvements 
net cash provided from financing activities during was  and consisted of net proceeds from the issuance of the series b preferred stock to finance the acquisition of the ibm patents  the credit facility with foothill and the exercise of stock options  offset by the redemption of series b preferred stock  the repayment of a note payable to former owners of mec and repayment of a capital lease obligation

financing 
on april   the company entered into a loan agreement with foothill for a loan of up to million  consisting of a term loan in the amount of million and a revolving loan in an amount of of the eligible receivables of lasersight technologies  but not in excess of million 
the original terms of the term loan provided for interest at an annual rate of and required repayment of principal in monthly installments of million beginning on may  the revolving loan bears interest at a variable annual rate of above the base rate of norwest bank minnesota 
the original terms of the revolving loan provided that the million maximum amount of the revolving loan was to decline by million per month beginning on august  in connection with the loan  the company paid an origination fee of  and issued warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
the warrants are exercisable at any time from april  through april  at an exercise price initially equal to per share 
subject to certain conditions based on the market price of the common stock  up to half of the warrants are eligible for repurchase by the company 
any warrants that remain outstanding and unexercised on april  are subject to mandatory repurchase by the company at a price of per warrant 
based on an agreement between foothill and the company and certain anti dilution features of the foothill warrants  the issuance of the series b preferred stock resulted in i an increase in number of foothill warrant shares by approximately  ii a reduction in the warrant exercise price to approximately per share  and iii a reduction in the repurchase price of the warrants to approximately per warrant 
the foothill loan is secured by a pledge of substantially all of the company s accounts receivable and other assets 
the company used a portion of the net proceeds of the term loan to pay in full the balance due under its note to the former owners of mec 
on december   the company used million of proceeds from the sale of mec and lsia to reduce the principal balance of its term loan with foothill  from million to million 
the company also used approximately million of proceeds from the sale to repay the balance under its revolving loan facility with foothill as of december  effective as of december   the company restructured its agreements with foothill as follows the maximum amount available under its revolving loan facility has been reduced to million 
in addition  the company pledged its vision shares to foothill as collateral 
after the company has received aggregate gross proceeds of million from the liquidation of the vision shares  it must apply any additional proceeds to repay its term loan with foothill  and apply any remaining proceeds to retire any then outstanding advances under its revolving loan with foothill 
in any event  the company s term and revolving loans are to be paid in full by june  until june   foothill has waived the company s compliance with the financial covenants contained in the loan agreements 
redemption and repurchase of series b preferred stock 
the company voluntarily redeemed shares of the series b preferred stock approximately of the  shares originally issued in october the company paid the redemption price of  including a redemption premium with funds held in a blocked account which serves as collateral for the company s contingent obligation to redeem series b preferred stock 
as required by its agreement with the preferred shareholders  the company had established the million blocked account to hold of the million the company had received in september as a payment for an exclusive  worldwide  royalty free license to a third party covering the use in the vascular and cardiovascular fields of the ibm patents 
the company believes that its continued holding of the restricted funds in the blocked account instead of redeeming the preferred shares would not have meaningfully enhanced the company s liquidity and would  under the terms of the series b preferred stock  have resulted in an increase in the redemption premium to as much as or the expiration in january of the company s option to redeem such shares 
in addition  the company believes that the redemption reduced the dilutive effect of the series b preferred stock on the company s common shareholders 
in addition  the company repurchased shares of series b preferred stock approximately of the shares originally issued in february and march in exchange for the consent of the holders of series b preferred stock to the sale of the international patent rights to the ibm patents see recent developments nidek patent transaction and agreements with preferred shareholders  the company agreed to deposit million of the sale transaction proceeds into the blocked account 
the company used such funds to pay the repurchase price of  including a premium 
the company believes that without the consent of the preferred shareholders  the transaction would not have been completed 
in addition  the company believes that the repurchase reduced the dilutive effect of the series b preferred stock on the company s common shareholders 
working capital requirements 
the company experienced a significant negative cash flow from operations in  largely resulting from the level of laser system sales and the increase in research  development and regulatory expenses resulting from the development of the lsx and other efforts as previously described 
the company expects cash flow from operations to begin to show improvement in the second and third quarters of as a result of the expected shipment of the lsx and a d k s as previously discussed 
however  the company expects to incur a loss and a deficit in cash flow from operations for the first quarter of there can be no assurance that the company can regain or sustain profitability or positive operative cash flow in any subsequent fiscal period 
based on these factors  the company believes that its balances of cash and cash equivalents along with expected operating cash flows  the anticipated liquidation of the vision shares and the availability of the foothill revolver through june   will be sufficient to fund its anticipated working capital requirements for the next months based on modest growth and anticipated collection of receivables 
a failure to collect timely a material portion of current receivables  unexpected delays in the shipment of the lsx or a d k products  or a delay in the anticipated liquidation of the vision shares could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity 
the company may from time to time reassess its credit policy and the terms it will make available to individual customers 
with the anticipated sales of the new lsx laser system during  the company intends to internally finance a proportionately smaller number of sales over periods exceeding months than in preceding years 
there can be no assurance as to the terms or amount of third party financing  if any  that the company s customers may obtain in the future 
the company is placing greater emphasis on the terms and collection timing of future sales 
the company expects to increase the level of manufacturing and distribution of its laser systems and to continue a variety of research and development activities on its excimer and solid state laser systems over the next twelve months and it is anticipated that such research and development as well as regulatory efforts in the us will be the most significant technology related expenses in the foreseeable future 
possible joint ventures 
the company is receptive to joint venture discussions with compatible companies for the development and operation in international markets of surgical centers that will utilize the company s products 
the company has no present commitments for joint venture relationships  and no assurance can be given that any such relationships will be secured on terms satisfactory to the company 
in october  the company announced an agreement with laser vision centers  inc laser vision to create a joint venture to make excimer laser technology available to the participating physicians of lasersight centers 
if finalized  such an agreement would have provided for laser vision to provide the excimer laser and necessary technical personnel to locations serviced by the approximately ophthalmologists currently under non exclusive contract with lasersight for excimer laser services 
no written agreement has been executed and no further negotiations are under way at this time 
stock subscription receivable 
the company is owed  on a promissory note from the company s former placement agent in connection with a placement of common stock in january the company s lawsuit to collect on the note resulted in the issuance in december of a final judgment in favor of the company in the amount of  together with interest in the amount of  and costs and attorneys fees in an amount yet to be determined 
despite the fact that the defendants have appealed the judgment  the company is currently pursuing efforts to collect the judgment 
risk factors and uncertainties the business  results of operations and financial condition of the company and the market price of the common stock may be adversely affected by a variety of factors  including the ones noted below potentially unlimited number of series b conversion shares issuable 
there is no limit on the number of shares of common stock potentially issuable in connection with conversions of series b preferred stock 
as illustrated in the table below  the number of shares of common stock issuable upon such conversions the series b conversion shares depends on the market price of the common stock at the time of conversions assumed number of as of common shares conversion series b conversion assumed outstanding price shares issuable after conversion equals the lesser of a or b the average of the three lowest closing bid prices of the common stock during the trading days immediately preceding the applicable conversion date 
excludes an aggregate of  series b conversion shares that have been issued in connection with conversions through march  based on an agreement between the company and the holders of the series b preferred stock  no more than  additional series b conversion shares may be issued before june  or  subject to certain shareholder approval requirements  september  this agreement can be terminated by the preferred shareholders under certain circumstances 
see recent developments agreement with preferred shareholders proposed revision of terms 
equals the  shares of common stock outstanding on march  plus the number of series b conversion shares issuable upon the conversion at a conversion price indicated in the table of all shares of series b preferred stock outstanding as of such date 
equals the conversion price in effect as of march  under the terms of the series b preferred stock  the conversion price cannot exceed  regardless of the market price of the common stock 
the company has agreed  subject to the approval of its stockholders  to amend the terms of the series b preferred stock to adjust this maximum conversion price to equal the lesser of or of the average closing bid prices of the common stock during the trading day period ending on september  failure to receive such approval on or before june  will require the company to issue to the holders of the series b preferred stock warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
see recent developments agreement with preferred shareholders proposed revision of terms 
potential obligations to redeem preferred stock 
any holder of series b preferred stock could require the redemption of all or a portion of its shares for cash at a premium of at least under any of the following circumstances o if the company fails to maintain the effectiveness of its registration statement under the securities act of the securities act relating to the resale of the series b conversion shares and the common stock issuable upon the exercise of warrants such shares  the series b warrant shares issued in connection with the company s private placement of the series b preferred stock in august by the holders thereof 
o if the company becomes required to register additional series b conversion shares under the securities act  but for any reason fails to have a registration statement relating to such shares declared effective by the sec within days after such requirement first arises 
based on the number of shares of series b preferred stock outstanding as of march   and the number of series b conversion shares that have already been registered  the company estimates that it would be required to file such a registration statement if the conversion price of the series b preferred stock were to decline below approximately 
o if the company fails to take all necessary action including obtaining any necessary stockholder approvals to authorize the issuance of additional shares of common stock as may become required in connection with the exercise of the series b preferred stock and the exercise of the series b warrants 
such authorization of additional common stock would be required if the number of shares of common stock reserved for such issuance becomes  for any period of three consecutive trading days  less than of the number of shares of common stock that would then be issuable upon conversion of the outstanding series b preferred stock 
under any of these circumstances  the redemption price per share of series b preferred stock to be redeemed would equal the liquidation preference of  per share multiplied by the greater of i or ii a fraction  the numerator of which would equal the highest closing bid price of the common stock during the period beginning trading days before the redemption date and ending five business days after such date  and the denominator of which would equal the conversion price that would have been applicable if the preferred shares had been converted as of the redemption date 
the fraction described in the preceding sentence will depend on market prices of the common stock and could significantly exceed 
there can be no assurance that the company would have the financial resources to pay any such redemption price 
in addition  any required redemption of preferred shares would cause a default under the company s credit facility with foothill that would entitle foothill to accelerate the otherwise applicable maturity date june  of the company s foothill debt

at december   the company s trade accounts and notes receivable aggregated approximately  net of allowances for collection losses and returns of approximately  accrued commissions  the payment of which generally depends on the collection of such net trade accounts and notes receivable  aggregated approximately  at december  exposure to collection losses on receivables is principally dependent on the company s customers ongoing financial condition and their ability to generate revenues from the company s laser systems 
in addition  approximately and of net receivables at december  and  respectively  related to international accounts 
the increase in this percentage between and resulted from the company s december sale of its mec and lsia subsidiaries substantially all of whose receivables related to us accounts 
the company s ability to evaluate the financial condition and revenue generating ability of its prospective customers located outside of the us is generally more limited than for customers located in the us although the company monitors the status of its receivables and maintains a reserve for estimated losses  there can be no assurance that the company s reserves for estimated losses  at december  will be sufficient to cover actual write offs over time 
during  the company wrote off approximately  of receivables 
actual write offs that materially exceed amounts reserved could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
restructuring of receivables 
at december   the company had restructured laser customer accounts in the aggregate amount of approximately  of the gross receivables as of such date  resulting in the extension of the original payment terms by periods ranging from to months 
the company s liquidity and operating cash flow will be adversely affected if additional extensions become necessary in the future 
in addition  it may be more difficult to collect laser system receivables if the payment schedule extends beyond the expected economic life of the laser system 
potential liquidity problems 
during the year ended december   the company experienced a million deficit in cash flow from operations  largely resulting from the loss incurred during and the increase in the company s research  development and regulatory expenses 
of this amount  approximately was incurred during the third and fourth quarters of the year 
the company expects that any improvements in cash flow from operations will depend on  among other things  the company s ability to market  produce and sell its new lsx laser systems and its a d k product on a commercial basis 
see new products and minimum payments under a d k license agreement below 
as of march   the lsx laser system had not made any significant contribution to the company s operating cash flow 
based on the status of clinical validation and refinement of the manufacturing processes  the company does not expect significant commercial shipments of the a d k until mid subject to these factors  the company believes that its balances of cash and cash equivalents  together with expected operating cash flows  the anticipated liquidation of the vision shares  and the availability of up to million under its revolving credit facility with foothill through june   will be sufficient to fund its anticipated working capital requirements for a month period based on anticipated collection of receivables 
however  if the company does not collect timely a material portion of current receivables  experiences significant further delays in the shipment of its lsx or a d k  experiences less market demand for such products than it anticipates  or experiences a delay in the anticipated liquidation of the vision shares the company s liquidity could be materially adversely affected 
uncertainty regarding availability or terms of capital to satisfy possible additional needs 
the company may need additional capital  including to fund the following o any future negative cash flow from operations or the repayment on or before june  of any amounts borrowed under the company s revolving credit facility with foothill to finance such negative cash flow 
o certain cash payment obligations under the company s lasik pma application acquisition agreement of july with photomed  inc photomed 
such cash payment obligations include i million payable if the fda approves the lasik pma application for commercial sale before july  and ii if the fda approves the company s scanning laser for commercial sale in the us before january    for each day or approximately  for each month between the date of such approval and january   subject to a maximum of million 
these obligations are in addition to the company s obligation to pay million in common stock 
see possible dilutive issuance of common stock photomed 
o additional working capital necessary to develop a production line for the lasik laser system and to obtain the gmp good manufacturing practice clearance from the fda that is required for the commercial sale of the lasik laser system 
o additional working capital necessary to support the commercial introduction of its laser systems into the us market after receiving fda approval 
the company believes the earliest these expenses might occur is the second half of in addition  the company may seek alternative sources of capital to fund its product development activities and to consummate future strategic acquisitions 
except for additional borrowing available as of march   up to million under its revolving credit facility with foothill through june  and an aggregate of approximately million to million subject to certain post closing adjustments scheduled to be received in increasing monthly installments from february through may of approximately million has been received to date in from the sale or redemption of the vision shares see recent developments liquidation of vision shares  the company has no commitments or proposals from third parties to supply additional capital  and there can be no assurance as to whether or on what terms the company could obtain additional capital 
to the extent that the company satisfies its future financing requirements through the sale of equity securities  holders of common stock may experience significant dilution in earnings per share and in net book value per share 
such dilution may be more significant if the company sells additional preferred stock with a conversion price linked to the market price of the common stock at the time of conversion as is the case with the series b preferred stock 
the foothill financing or other debt financing could result in a substantial portion of the company s cash flow from operations being dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness and may render the company more vulnerable to competitive pressures and economic downturns 
if the company cannot obtain additional capital on satisfactory terms  it may be required to sell additional assets 
adverse consequences if company cannot receive agreed upon value of its vision shares 
as described in more detail below under recent developments liquidation of vision shares  vision has agreed to pay to the company on may  an amount equal to the amount the shortfall payment  if any  by which the gross proceeds of sales of the vision shares fall short of million subject to certain post closing adjustments 
both the value of the vision shares and the ability of vision to make the shortfall payment if any is required is subject to risks  including without limitation the risks disclosed in vision s filings with the sec 
copies of such filings can be obtained  upon payment of prescribed fees  at the public reference room of the sec at fifth street  nw  washington  nw or from the sec s web site containing information filed electronically with the sec

to the extent that the liquidation of the vision shares does not occur according to the schedule specified in the company s agreement with vision  or any required shortfall payment is not paid when due  the company s liquidity and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
possible dilutive issuance of common stock lasersight centers and florida laser partners 
based on previously reported agreements entered into in in connection with the company s acquisition of lasersight centers the company s development stage subsidiary and modified in july and march  the company is obligated as follows o to issue to the former shareholders and option holders including two trusts related to the chairman of the board of the company and certain former officers and directors of the company of lasersight centers  up to  unregistered shares of common stock the centers contingent shares based on the company s pre tax operating income through march from performing prk or other refractive laser surgical procedures 
the centers contingent shares are issuable at the rate of one share per of such operating income 
o to pay to a partnership whose partners include the chairman of the board of the company and certain former officers and directors of the company a royalty of up to payable in cash or shares of common stock the royalty shares  for each eye on which a laser refractive optical surgical procedure is conducted on an excimer laser system owned or operated by lasersight centers or its affiliates 
royalties do not begin to accrue until the earlier of march or the delivery of all of the  centers contingent shares 
as of december   the company had not accrued any obligation to issue centers contingent shares or royalty shares 
there can be no assurance that any issuance of centers contingent shares or royalty shares will be accompanied by an increase in the company s per share operating results 
the company is not obligated to pursue strategies that may result in the issuance of centers contingent shares or royalty shares 
it may be in the interest of the chairman of the board for the company to pursue business strategies that maximize the issuance of centers contingent shares and royalty shares 
possible dilutive issuance of common stock tfg 
to the extent that the company s the farris group subsidiary achieves certain pre tax income levels during  the earnout provisions of the company s agreement for the acquisition of the farris group in would require the company to issue to the former owner of such company mr 
michael r 
farris  the president and chief executive officer of the company up to approximately  shares of common stock the farris contingent shares 
there can be no assurance that any issuance of the farris contingent shares will be accompanied by an increase in the company s per share operating results 
possible dilutive issuance of common stock photomed 
if the fda approves a lasersight manufactured laser system for general commercial use in the treatment of hyperopia farsightedness after having approved for commercial sale the lasik pma application to which the company acquired rights in august  the company would be required to issue additional shares of common stock with a market value of million based on the average closing price of the common stock during the preceding day period 
if such market value had been computed as of march   the number of additional shares issuable would have been approximately  depending on whether and when such fda approval is received and on the market price of the common stock at the time of any such approval  the actual number of additional shares issuable could be more but not more than permitted under the listing rules of the nasdaq stock market or less than this number 
possible dilutive issuance of common stock nnjei 
in connection with the acquisition of the assets of nnjei by the company s lsia subsidiary in july  the company agreed to issue up to  additional shares of common stock if the average closing price of the common stock during the day period immediately preceding july  is less than per share 
all  shares will be issuable unless such average closing price is more than per share 
the company s sale of lsia in december does not affect this contingent obligation 
acquisition and financing related contingent commitments to issue additional common shares 
the company may from time to time include in future acquisitions and financings provisions which would require the company to issue additional shares of its common stock at a future date based on the market price of the common stock at such date 
persons who are the beneficiaries of such provisions effectively receive some protection from declines in the market price of the common stock  but other shareholders of the company will incur additional dilution of their ownership interest in the event of a decline in the price of the common stock 
such dilution may be increased by provisions in the warrant issued to foothill that may increase the number of shares issuable under the foothill warrant and decrease the exercise price of the foothill warrant 
the factors to be considered by the company in including such provisions may include the company s cash resources  the trading history of common stock  the negotiating position of the selling party or the investors  as applicable  and the extent to which the company estimates that the expected benefit from the acquisition or financing exceeds the expected dilutive effect of the price protection provision

dependence on key personnel 
the company is dependent on its executive officers and other key employees  especially michael r 
farris  its president and chief executive officer  and j 
richard crowley  the president and chief operating officer of its lasersight technologies subsidiary 
a loss of one or more such officers or key employees  especially of mr

risks associated with past and possible future acquisitions 
the company has made several significant acquisitions since  including tfg in  photomed in  and its acquisition of the ibm patents in august these acquisitions  as well as any future acquisition  may not achieve adequate levels of revenue  profitability or productivity or may not otherwise perform as expected 
acquisitions involve special risks  including unanticipated liabilities and contingencies  diversion of management attention and possible adverse effects on operating results resulting from increased goodwill amortization  increased interest costs  the issuance of additional securities and difficulties related to the integration of the acquired businesses 
although the company is currently focusing on its existing operations  the future ability of the company to achieve growth through acquisitions will depend on a number of factors  including the availability of attractive acquisition opportunities  the availability of funds needed to complete acquisitions  the availability of working capital needed to fund the operations of acquired businesses and the effect of existing and emerging competition on operations 
should additional acquisitions be sought  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully identify additional suitable acquisition candidates  complete additional acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses into its operations 
see recent developments schwarz electro optics  inc letter of intent 
amortization of significant intangible assets 
of the company s total assets at december   approximately million were intangible assets  of which approximately million reflects goodwill which is being amortized using an estimated life ranging from to years  approximately million reflects the cost of patents which is being amortized over a period ranging from approximately to years  and approximately million reflects the cost of licenses and technology acquired which is being amortized over a period ranging from months to years 
the year life of acquired technology was determined based on the company s best judgment at the time of the most likely life span of a solid state laser product and related patent 
the major factors involved in the company s ongoing assessment are its judgment whether there will be a market for solid state as an improvement to existing excimer laser technology and that there is an industry and marketplace interest in such development that can be successfully pursued by the company or others that will result in revenue from the associated patent 
the company s intangible assets were decreased by approximately million as a result of the february closing of the company s patent agreement with nidek 
see recent developments nidek patent transactions 
goodwill is an intangible asset that represents the difference between the total purchase price of the acquisitions and the amount of such purchase price allocated to the fair value of the net assets acquired 
goodwill and other intangibles are amortized over a period of time  with the amount amortized in a particular period constituting a non cash expense that reduces the company s net income or increases the company s net loss in that period 
a reduction in net income resulting from the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles may have an adverse impact upon the market price of the common stock 
in addition  in the event of a sale or liquidation of the company or its assets  there can be no assurance that the value of such intangible assets would be recovered 
in accordance with sfas  the company reviews intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances  including a history of operating or cash flow losses  indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in such cases  the carrying amount of the asset is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss will be computed and recognized in accordance with sfas expected cash flows are based on factors including historical results  current operating budgets and projections  industry trends and expectations  and competition 
the company continues to assess the current results and future prospects of its tfg subsidiary in view of the substantial reduction in its operating results in and if tfg is unsuccessful in meeting its budget or otherwise improving its financial performance  some or all of the carrying amount of goodwill recorded  at december  may be subject to an impairment adjustment 
year concerns 
the company believes that it has prepared its computer systems and related applications to accommodate date sensitive information relating to the year the company expects that any additional costs related to ensuring such systems to be year compliant will not be material to the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
such costs will be expensed as incurred 
in addition  the company is discussing with its vendors the possibility of any interface difficulties which may affect the company 
to date  no significant concerns have been identified 
however  there can be no assurance that no year related operating problems or expenses will arise with the company s computer systems and software or in their interface with the computer systems and software of the company s vendors 
government regulation 
the company s laser products are subject to strict governmental regulations which materially affect the company s ability to manufacture and market these products and directly impact the company s overall prospects 
all laser devices to be marketed in interstate commerce are subject to the laser regulations required by the radiation control for health and safety act  as administered by the fda 
such act imposes design and performance standards  labeling and reporting requirements  and submission conditions in advance of marketing for all medical laser products 
the company s laser systems produced for medical use require pma by the fda before they can be marketed in the us each separate medical device requires a separate fda submission  and specific protocols have to be submitted to the fda for each claim made for each medical device 
in addition  laser products marketed in foreign countries are often subject to local laws governing health product development processes which may impose additional costs for overseas product development 
the company cannot determine the costs or time it will take to complete the approval process and the related clinical testing for its medical laser products 
future legislative or administrative requirements in the us  or elsewhere  may adversely affect the company s ability to obtain or retain regulatory approval for its laser products 
the failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
uncertainty concerning patents international 
should lasersight technologies lasers infringe upon any valid and enforceable patents in international markets  then lasersight technologies may be required to obtain licenses for such patents 
should such licenses not be obtained  lasersight technologies might be prohibited from manufacturing or marketing its prk uv lasers in those countries where patents are in effect 
the company s international sales accounted for and  of the company s total revenues during and  respectively 
the company expects such percentages to increase in future periods as a result of its sale of mec and lsia in december uncertainty concerning patents us should lasersight technologies lasers infringe upon any valid and enforceable patents held by pillar point partners a partnership of which the general partners are subsidiaries of visx and summit technologies in the us  then lasersight technologies may be required to obtain a license for such patents 
in connection with its march settlement of litigation with pillar point partners  the company agreed to notify pillar point partners before the company begins manufacturing or selling its laser systems in the us if such licenses are required but not obtained  lasersight technologies might be prohibited from manufacturing or marketing its prk uv lasers in the us competition 
the vision correction industry is subject to intense  increasing competition 
the company competes against both alternative and traditional medical technologies such as eyeglasses  contact lenses and rk and other laser manufacturers 
many of the company s competitors have existing products and distribution systems in the marketplace and are substantially larger  better financed  and better known 
a number of lasers manufactured by other companies have either received  or are much further advanced in the process of receiving  fda approval for specific procedures  and  accordingly  may have or develop a higher level of acceptance in some markets than the company s lasers 
the entry of new competitors into the markets for the company s products could cause downward pressure on the prices of such products and a material adverse effect on company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
technological change 
technological developments in the medical and laser industries are expected to continue at a rapid pace 
newer technologies and surgical techniques could be developed which may offer better performance than the company s laser systems 
the success of any competing alternatives to prk and lasik could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
new products 
the company may experience difficulties that could further delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of its new lsx excimer laser  its recently announced a d k  and other new products and enhancements  or that its new products and enhancements will be accepted in the marketplace 
as is typical in the case of new and rapidly evolving industries  demand and market acceptance for recently introduced technology and products are subject to a high level of uncertainty 
in addition  announcements of new products whether for sale in the near future or at some later date may cause customers to defer purchasing existing company products 
minimum payments under a d k license agreement 
in addition to the risks relating to the introduction of any new product see new products above  the company s a d k is subject to the risk that the company is required to make certain minimum payments to the licensors under its limited exclusive license agreement relating to the a d k 
under that agreement  the company is required to pay a total of  in two installments due six and months after the date of the company s receipt of completed limited production molds for the a d k and provide an excimer laser 
the company expects to receive such molds during the second quarter of in addition  commencing seven months after such date  the company s royalty payments of its gross profits from a d k sales will become subject to a minimum of  per quarter 
uncertainty of market acceptance of laser based eye treatment 
the company believes that its achievement of profitability and growth will depend in part upon broad acceptance of prk or lasik in the us and other countries 
there can be no assurance that prk or lasik will be accepted by either the ophthalmologists or the public as an alternative to existing methods of treating refractive vision disorders 
the acceptance of prk and lasik may be affected adversely by their cost  possible concerns relating to safety and efficacy  general resistance to surgery  the effectiveness and lower cost of alternative methods of correcting refractive vision disorders  the lack of long term follow up data  the possibility of unknown side effects  the lack of third party reimbursement for the procedures  any future unfavorable publicity involving patient outcomes from use of prk or lasik systems  and the possible shortages of ophthalmologists trained in the procedures 
the failure of prk or lasik to achieve broad market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
international sales 
international sales may be limited or disrupted by the imposition of government controls  export license requirements  political instability  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs  difficulties in staffing and coordinating communications among and managing international operations 
additionally  the company s business  financial condition and international results of operations may be adversely affected by increases in duty rates  difficulties in obtaining export licenses  ability to maintain or increase prices  and competition 
to date  all sales made by the company have been denominated in us dollars 
therefore  the company does not have exposure to typical foreign currency fluctuation risk 
due to its export sales  however  the company is subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations in the us dollar  which could increase the effective price in local currencies of the company s products 
this could in turn result in reduced sales  longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collection of receivables 
see receivables above 
although the company has not experienced any material adverse effect on its operations as a result of such regulatory  political and other factors  such factors may have a material adverse effect on the company s operations in the future or require the company to modify its business practices 
potential product liability claims  limited insurance 
as a producer of medical devices  the company may face liability for damages to users of such devices in the event of product failure 
the testing and use of human care products entails an inherent risk of negligence or other action 
an award of damages in excess of the company s insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
while the company maintains product liability insurance  there can be no assurance that any such liability of the company will be included within its insurance coverage or that damages will not exceed the limits of its coverage 
the company s insurance coverage is limited to  including up to  of coverage under an excess liability policy 
supplier risks 
the company contracts with third parties for certain components used in its lasers 
certain key components are provided by a single vendor 
if any of these sole source suppliers were to cease providing components to the company  the company would have to locate and contract with a substitute supplier  and there can be no assurances that such substitute supplier could be located and qualified in a timely manner or could provide required components on commercially reasonable terms 
an interruption in the supply of critical laser components could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
no backlog  concentration of sales at end of quarter 
the company has historically operated with little or no backlog because its products are generally shipped as orders are received 
historically  the company has received and shipped a significant portion of its orders for a particular quarter near the end of the quarter 
as a result  the company s operating results for any quarter often depend on orders received and laser systems shipped late in that quarter 
any delay in such orders or shipments may cause a significant fluctuation in period to period operating results 
recent developments liquidation of vision shares 
in connection with the sale of its mec and lsia subsidiaries to vision on december   vision agreed to liquidate the vision shares by a public sale pursuant to a registration statement or a private placement  or by its repurchase of the vision shares 
the company is entitled to receive at least  but not more than  from the liquidation of the vision shares 
if the company has not received the minimum amount subject to the post closing adjustments described below by may   then on such date vision is to pay the company the shortfall in cash 
the vision shares are to be liquidated on a monthly schedule between february and may approximately as follows or sooner  at vision s option february  march  april  may 
the company received substantially all of the february installment on march  as of march   the march  april and may installments remain outstanding 
vision has advised the company that vision intends to file a registration statement to facilitate the liquidation of the remaining vision shares 
as of march   vision has not filed such registration statement 
the company cannot predict whether the remaining installments of the vision shares will be liquidated on a timely basis 
the remaining vision shares represent approximately of vision s outstanding common stock as of march  based on information provided by vision to the company 
vision common stock has traded on the nasdaq stock market since august   the date of vision s initial public offering at a price of per share 
the market price of vision common stock has since ranged from a low of on december  to on september  
on march   the closing price of vision common stock was nidek patent transaction 
on february   the company closed the nidek transaction 
the closing resulted in nidek s payment of million in cash of which  was withheld for the payment of japanese taxes in exchange for the company s grant to nidek of certain rights in certain of the ibm patents 
the company has transferred to nidek all rights in those ibm patents which have been issued in countries outside of the us the us patents 
in addition  the company has granted nidek a non exclusive license to use the ibm patents issued in the us the us patents 
the company continues to hold the following rights relating to the ibm patents o a nonexclusive license to use subject to the payment of a per unit royalty the non us patents in the ophthalmic field in all countries that issued them 
o an exclusive license to use and sublicense the non us patents in all fields other than the ophthalmic  cardiovascular and vascular areas subject to a royalty in certain countries 
o the ownership of the us patents  subject to a non exclusive licenses granted to nidek and five ophthalmic laser system producers including visx  summit technology and autonomous technologies and b an exclusive license to use the ibm patents in the vascular and cardiovascular fields granted to a third party in september o the right to receive royalties from visx and summit technology equal to of their us revenue from the sale of laser systems that rely on the ibm patents 
the nidek transaction will not affect the rights of other companies to use the ibm patents in any country covered by existing license agreements 
the nidek transaction is not expected to result in any current gain or loss 
it will  however  reduce the company s amortization expense over the remaining useful life of the non us patents 
the nidek transaction also will result in approximately million of prepaid royalties that will be amortized to income over time 
agreement with preferred shareholders put option 
in exchange for the consent of the holders of its series b preferred stock that the company needed to obtain to be able to complete the nidek transaction  the company entered into the following agreement with such preferred holders o the company deposited million of the nidek transaction proceeds into a blocked account for the exclusive benefit of the preferred holders 
the million remainder of the million of the nidek transaction proceeds remained available for general corporate purposes after payment of expenses estimated at  o the preferred holders received an option to sell to the company the put option up to shares of series b preferred stock representing an aggregate face amount of  at a price equal to of such face amount 
the put option has been fully exercised 
agreement with preferred shareholders proposed revision of terms 
on march   the company entered into an agreement with all of the holders of its series b preferred stock as follows o until june   the preferred holders will limit their conversions of series b preferred stock so that no more than  common shares are issued during such period 
immediately prior to this conversion restriction becoming effective  the preferred holders submitted to the company notices for the conversion of shares of preferred stock into  shares of common stock 
this conversion restriction will be extended to september  if the company s stockholders approve certain proposals described below at the company s annual meeting on june  o the preferred holders granted the company an option to purchase any or all of the remaining series b preferred stock at a premium at any time before june  because the company s agreement with foothill prevents any redemptions of preferred stock so long as any of the foothill loans remain outstanding  such a repurchase would require the company to first obtain foothill s approval 
it would also require the company to raise the funds necessary to finance such repurchase 
there can be no assurance as to whether or on what terms the company could obtain such foothill consent or additional financing 
o subject to the approval of the company s common stockholders and the conversion restrictions being effective through september   the fixed conversion price component of the series b preferred stock will equal the lower of a its current level or b of the average closing bid prices of the common stock during the trading days ending on september  o subject to the approval of the company s common stockholders  the exercise price of the warrants issued to the preferred holders in august the existing warrants will be reduced from per share to of an average closing bid price of the common stock during the five trading days following march  
the existing warrants would remain exercisable at any time through august  and their exercise would not be subject to the  common share limit on conversions of preferred stock 
o if for any reason the company s common stockholders fail to approve the change in the fixed conversion price component and the exercise price of the existing warrants on or before june   the company will be required to issue to the preferred holders  additional warrants the additional warrants to purchase common stock at a price equal to per share of an average closing bid price of the common stock during the five trading days following march  
the additional warrants would be exercisable at any time through august  and would not be subject to the  common share limit on conversions of preferred stock 
the restrictions on conversions and the company s repurchase option may be terminated by the preferred holders under any of the following circumstances o as of the end of any month  the company s current ratio current assets divided by current liabilities falls below to o as of the end of the first or second quarter of  the company s income or loss from operations for such quarter has not improved relative to the company s results for the prior quarter 
o at any time  the company undergoes or announces a material adverse change in its financial condition  operating results  assets  liabilities  operations or business prospects which is material to the company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole
