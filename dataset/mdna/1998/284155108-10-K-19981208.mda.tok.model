item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section  as well as in the section entitled business 
results of operations the following table sets forth  as a percentage of net revenues  certain consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated 
september  net revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development marketing  sales  general and administrative income from operations income before income taxes net income net revenues 
net revenues were million in fiscal  an increase of over net revenues of million in fiscal the increase in net revenues was due to an increase in unit shipments  while the average selling price for the company s products remained relatively constant during the year 
the company experienced strong revenue growth in each of its major end markets and particularly in the data processing area which represented of net revenues  up from approximately of net revenues in fiscal geographically  the company experienced broad revenue growth with us revenues up and international revenues up over fiscal international revenues represented of net revenues  down slightly from of net revenues in fiscal revenues from japan and other pacific rim countries increased over fiscal despite the economic and financial difficulties experienced by japan and other countries in this region 
however  as discussed more fully under factors affecting future operating results below  in late fiscal the company s incoming order rate began to slow  reflecting lower end customer demand 
the company currently anticipates that continued lower product demand will cause fiscal to begin with lower unit volume and revenues than the fourth quarter of fiscal domestic revenues represented of net revenues  an increase from of net revenues in fiscal  primarily due to strong domestic shipments during the last two quarters of fiscal net revenues of million in fiscal were down as compared to net revenues of million in fiscal increase in unit volumes primarily in the video multimedia  communications and data processing markets were more than offset by a decrease in average selling prices 
net revenues in fiscal reflected a period of significant revenue growth that began to decelerate for the company and much of the semiconductor industry during the fourth quarter of fiscal excess inventory levels in end customer channels entering fiscal lead to generally flat quarterly sequential revenue growth until the second half of the fiscal year when end customer channel inventory levels declined 
international revenues represented and of net revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
international revenues increased in fiscal due primarily to increased revenues from japan and other pacific rim countries 
this increase was also partially due to a slight increase in revenues from the european market 
in july  the company announced that it would discontinue its military and commercial hybrid product 
this product line accounted for  and of product revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
orders for these discontinued products were accepted through the middle of and last shipments from the factory will extend throughout fiscal the company expects higher gross margins from last buy orders during fiscal however  the company does not expect the discontinuance of this product line to have a material impact on the company s fiscal results from operations 
gross margin 
gross margin was million or of net revenues in fiscal the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenues  as compared to in fiscal  was due primarily to the absorption of fixed costs over a larger revenue base and improved manufacturing yields and pricing at third party foundries 
this was partially offset by higher unfavorable overhead variances relating to internal production as product mix shifted towards products manufactured by third party foundries during the second half of fiscal  and increased provisions for inventory excess and obsolescence 
however  as discussed more fully under factors affecting future operating results below  the company expects to complete an extensive production expansion at its primary manufacturing facility during the second fiscal quarter of this expansion is expected to significantly increase manufacturing expenses  which could reduce gross margins 
while the company is working on programs to continue to improve manufacturing efficiencies  there can be no assurance that the company will not encounter difficulties due to delays with technology introduction  over capacity caused by expanding the company s milpitas wafer fabrication facility  changes in product mix  unfavorable manufacturing yields or other manufacturing difficulties in the future 
gross margin may continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
gross margin as a percentage of revenues of in fiscal fell from of net revenues in fiscal the decrease in gross margin from fiscal to resulted from continued reductions in average selling prices combined with increasingly unfavorable manufacturing yield and overhead variances and increased provisions for excess and obsolete inventory 
research and development expenses 
research and development r d expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and or  and of net revenues  respectively 
the increase in r d expenses in fiscal as compared to was due primarily to an increase in staffing  particularly design engineering personnel and higher spending for test and prototype 
the decrease in r d expenses in fiscal over was due to lower spending on prototype materials  consulting services and contract services 
marketing  sales  general and administrative expenses 
marketing  sales  general and administrative sg a expenses were million  million and million or  and of net revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in sg a expenses in fiscal over was due primarily to an increase in staffing and related payroll and benefit costs  increased legal expenses and higher consulting costs 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a decreased in fiscal as such costs increased at a lower rate than net revenue growth 
the increase in sg a expenses in fiscal as compared to was due primarily to added costs related to the company s new administrative offices 
interest and other income 
interest and other income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease from fiscal to was due to lower cash equivalents and short term investments resulting primarily from cash disbursed and lease payments made in conjunction with the company s fabrication facility expansion 
the increase in interest income from fiscal to resulted from investing proceeds from the company s initial public offering in october in cash equivalents and short term investments 
provision for taxes on income 
results for the fourth fiscal quarter of included a million favorable tax adjustment resulting primarily from the reversal of the company s valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets at september  this accounting adjustment was made in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  accounting for income taxes 
provisions for taxes on income for fiscal and were lower than the statutory rate principally due to the benefit of net operating loss carryforwards offset by alternative minimum taxes  state taxes and foreign withholding taxes 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
net income 
net income was million  million and million in  and  respectively  due to the factors described above 
factors affecting future operating results except for historical information contained herein  the matters set forth in the annual report  including the statements in the following paragraphs  are forward looking statements that are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties including such factors as  among others  delays in new product and process technology announcements and product introductions by the company or its competitors  competitive pricing pressures  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  changes in the mix or markets in which products are sold  availability and costs of raw materials  reliance on subcontractors  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  industry wide wafer processing capacity  political and economic conditions in various geographic areas  and costs associated with other events  such as under utilization or expansion of production capacity  intellectual property disputes  litigation  or environmental regulation and other factors described below 
the company achieved record revenues and earnings in fiscal however  during the fourth quarter demand weakened for the company s products resulting in a decrease in the company s order backlog as compared with the third quarter of fiscal the lower order activity appears to be industry wide and has resulted from several factors including prolonged weakness in the asian markets 
looking forward to the fiscal first quarter  management expects revenues to be impacted by an overall weak demand for analog semiconductor products 
the company believes weaker demand for the company s core products will be partially offset by increases in the company s optical storage products 
in addition  management expects overall margins to decline due to changing product mix  pricing pressures and under utilization of manufacturing capacity as the company adjusts production to meet weakened product demands 
during the first fiscal quarter of  prior to the filing of this report  the company was notified that one of its suppliers of cmos wafers located in san jose  california was abruptly closed 
management is moving quickly to secure an alternative manufacturing source and is confident that it will be able to transition affected cmos products to another foundry quickly 
however  in the event that the transition takes longer than anticipated  the company s revenue could be negatively impacted by as much as million per quarter for the second and third quarters of fiscal in november  david o brien  the company s president and chief executive officer resigned from the company 
the company is currently searching for a replacement 
however there can be no assurance that a qualified candidate will be hired in the near future 
james v 
diller  director and chairman of the board  is acting as president and chief executive officer in the interim 
the company sells its products to distributors and manufacturers in asian countries that are currently experiencing an economic recession 
additionally  of net revenues were to microtek international  inc in japan 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company experienced a slight decrease in revenues from these countries during the fourth quarter of fiscal  but the company does not expect that the financial difficulties experienced in asia will have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations in the near term 
however  should the financial conditions in this region worsen  become prolonged  or affect other countries where the company generates significant revenues  there can be no assurance that the company s results of operations will not be adversely impacted in the future 
the company utilizes various external foundries for the production of cmos and bipolar wafers as well as certain process steps in the manufacturing of dielectric isolation wafers 
the number of foundries that have the capability to process dielectrically isolated semiconductor wafers is limited 
the company has developed internal capability for a number of these dielectric isolation process steps and has secured an alternate vendor for one key process step 
the company was informed that the current dielectric isolation foundry would discontinue supplying this technology in the fourth fiscal quarter of the company converted production of most process steps and secured a vendor for an additional key process step during the fiscal fourth quarter of to mitigate potential problems during the transition  the company increased its inventory of processed di wafers during the second half of fiscal however  there can be no assurance that this manufacturing change can be successfully made in a timely manner or that the increased levels of dielectrically isolated wafers will be sufficient to meet the company s requirements 
significant delays in the transition to the new supply of dielectric isolated wafers or manufacturing problems encountered with either the internal process or the new supplier would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
in early fiscal  due to significant over capacity caused by continuing decreased demand in the semiconductor industry and changes in product mix towards products manufactured by third party foundries  the company evaluated its long term manufacturing and process technology strategies 
based on this evaluation  the company concluded that projected production volumes and related cash flows from the fabrication facility are not sufficient to recover its carrying value 
consequently  the company announced it will write down the carrying value related to its wafer fabrication facility located in milpitas  california in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards fas no  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
fas adjustments  in conjunction with other non recurring charges related to restructuring initiatives aimed at improving profitability  will result in a non recurring charge estimated at between to million on a pretax basis in the first quarter of fiscal the semiconductor industry is extremely capital intensive 
to remain competitive  the company may have to continue investing in advanced manufacturing equipment and process technologies 
while the company does not expect capital expenditures to be material during the fiscal  the company anticipates significant continuing capital expenditures during the following several years 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to seek debt or equity financing to satisfy its cash and capital needs or that such financing will be available on terms satisfactory to the company 
if such financing is required and if such financing were not available on terms satisfactory to the company  its operations would be materially adversely affected 
new products  process technology and start up costs associated with the company s new milpitas wafer fabrication facility will require significant research and development expenditures 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner  that new products will gain market acceptance or that new process technologies can be successfully implemented 
if the company is unable to develop new products in a timely manner  and to sell them at gross margins comparable to the company s current products  the future results of operations could be adversely impacted 
part of the company s future bipolar product development strategy includes the development of an alternative form of silicon on insulator soi technology called bonded wafers 
the company currently believes that  if successful  the bonded wafer technology could provide technologically advanced products at a lower cost than the current dielectric isolation complementary bipolar technology 
there can be no assurance that bonded wafer technology can be successfully implemented in a timely manner or that it will provide the desired improvements over the company s current technology 
significant delays or cancellation of the development of the bonded wafer technology and or manufacturing problems associated with transferring the company s current product line to this technology would have a material adverse affect on the company s business and results of operations 
in addition  delays or cancellation of the development of this technology could adversely affect the company s new product development program 
from time to time  the company has experienced production difficulties that have caused delivery delays and quality problems 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience manufacturing problems and product delivery delays in the future as a result of  among other things  changes to its process technologies  ramping production  installing new equipment at its facilities and constructing new facilities in milpitas  california 
during the fourth fiscal quarter of  the company reversed its valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  accounting for income taxes 
this resulted in a non recurring income tax benefit for fiscal of million or per diluted share 
the company expects the effective tax rate to range from to for fiscal the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions which have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
in recent years  there has been a growing trend of companies to resort to litigation to protect their semiconductor technology from unauthorized use by others 
the company believes its products do not infringe upon any valid patents 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s position in these matters will prevail 
there can be no assurance that additional future claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights will not be asserted against the company 
the intellectual property claims that have been made  or may be asserted against the company in the future  could require that the company discontinue the use of certain processes or cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products 
additionally  the company may incur significant litigation costs and damages to develop noninfringing technology 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to obtain such licenses on acceptable terms or to develop noninfringing technology without a material adverse effect on the company 
the company is subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in its manufacturing process 
although the company believes that its activities conform to presently applicable environmental regulations  the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on the company  suspension of production or a cessation of operations 
there can be no assurance that regulatory changes or changes in regulatory interpretation or enforcement will not render compliance more difficult and costly 
any failure of the company to control the use of  or adequately restrict the discharge of  hazardous substances  or otherwise comply with environmental regulations  could subject it to significant future liabilities 
the company s common stock has experienced substantial price volatility and such volatility may occur in the future  particularly as a result of quarter to quarter variations in the actual or anticipated financial results of the company  the companies in the semiconductor industry or in the markets served by the company  or announcements by the company or its competitors regarding new product introductions 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies stock in particular 
these factors may adversely affect the price of the common stock 
past performance of the company may not be a good indicator of future performance due to factors affecting the company  its competitors  the semiconductor industry and the overall economy 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change  price erosion  cyclical markets  periodic oversupply  occasional shortages of materials  capacity constraints  variation in manufacturing efficiencies and significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development 
furthermore  new product introductions and patent protection of existing products are critical factors for future sales growth and sustained profitability 
year readiness the company utilizes numerous software programs throughout its operations that include dates and make date sensitive calculations based on two digit fields that are assumed to begin with the year software programs written based on this assumption are vulnerable  as the year approaches  to miscalculations and other operational errors that may be significant to their overall effectiveness 
in addition  the company relies upon products and information from critical suppliers  large customers and other outside parties  in the normal course of business  whose software programs are also subject to the same problem 
should miscalculations or other operational errors occur as a result of the year issue  the company or the parties on which it depends may be unable to produce reliable information or process routine transactions 
furthermore  in the worse case  the company or the parties on which it depends may  for an extended period of time  be incapable of conducting critical business activities  which include but are not limited to  manufacturing and shipping products  invoicing customers and paying vendors 
the company initiated a year remediation plan during fiscal to make the company s primary and ancillary information systems year compliant 
this plan included the implementation of year compliant financial application and manufacturing execution software 
the new financial applications software has been implemented and the company is in the process of installing a manufacturing execution software upgrade 
based on current information  the company believes that its internal computer systems will be year compliant and that the risk of major disruption from these systems due to year issues is minimal 
the company s current revenue is generated from products that will not generate any product warranty or product defect liability issues related to the year compliance 
however  the company could be negatively affected to the extent its major suppliers  vendors and customers have not successfully addressed year issues and the company has initiated formal communications with all its significant suppliers  vendors and customers to assess this exposure 
the cost of implementing such a plan is being funded by income from operations and capital leases has not been and is not expected to be material to the company s operating results 
the cost to address and remedy the company s remaining year issues is estimated to be million in fiscal the cost of the year project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modification are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of liquidity are cash and short term investments of million at september  at september   the company also had a non revolving lease line of credit for up to million which can be utilized for up to of the value of financed equipment 
amounts drawn under this line represent five year capital leases 
the non revolving lease line of credit expires february  at september   million was outstanding  and approximately million remained available under the line 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents  its current lease line of credit and cash from operations will be sufficient to support its operating and capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
any major change in the nature of the company s business  such as the acquisition of products  the design of products not currently under development or the need for significant unplanned capital expenditures  could change the company s capital requirements 
to the extent the company requires additional cash  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to the company  or at all 
cash and equivalents at september  decreased by million or from september  net cash provided by operations was million during fiscal investing activities used million primarily due to the acquisition of million in property and equipment net of proceeds from disposition of property and equipment and capital lease financing which was partially offset by net sales of short term investments of million 
financing activities used million primarily for payments on long term debt of million and payments on capital lease financing of million which was partially offset by proceeds from exercise of employee stock options of million 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section  as well as in the section entitled factors affecting future results 
the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
the company maintains a short term investment portfolio consisting mainly of income securities with an average maturity of less than one year 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at september   the fair value of the approximately million portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
the company presently intends to hold its fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore the company would not expect its operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden short term change in market interest rates on its securities portfolio 
at september   the company had approximately million of outstanding obligations under capital lease arrangements and long term debt 
if short term interest rates were to increase percent  the increased lease payments associated with these arrangements would not have a material impact on the company s net income or cash flows as these borrowings do not carry variable interest rates 
the company does not hedge any interest rate exposures 
foreign currency exchange risk 
yen is the functional currency of the company s subsidiary in japan 
the company does not currently enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain balance sheet exposures and intercompany balances against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
however  the company does maintain cash balances denominated in yen 
if foreign exchange rates were to weaken against the us dollar immediately and uniformly by percent from the exchange rate at september   the fair value of these foreign currency amounts would decline by an immaterial amount
