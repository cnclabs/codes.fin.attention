item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview xionics document technologies  inc designs  develops and markets innovative software and silicon solutions for printing  scanning  copying  processing and transmitting digital documents to computer peripheral devices that perform document imaging functions 
such devices include printers  copiers  scanners  and fax machines  as well as multifunction peripherals that perform a combination of these imaging functions 
the company began in the late s to develop and introduce new document imaging technology used to accelerate the high volume capture  display and printing of business records 
in october  the company acquired certain assets of the peripherals division of phoenix technologies ltd 
phoenix  including page description language interpreters  printer operating systems software  network connectivity solutions and other core printer technologies the phoenix acquisition 
the phoenix acquisition was accounted for as a purchase in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to the purchase of incomplete research and development projects and was charged to expense as of the acquisition date 
in february  the company acquired gca gesellschaft fur computer anwendung mbh gca for million in cash the gca acquisition 
the gca acquisition was also accounted for as a purchase in accordance with apb opinion no 
the company allocated the purchase price based on the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
a significant portion of the purchase price was identified in an independent appraisal as intangible assets using proven valuation procedures and techniques  including approximately million of in process research and development 
acquired intangibles include the assembled workforce of gca and goodwill 
in june the company announced a restructuring of its operations to position the company to return to profitability resulting in non recurring charges including amounts in discontinued operations of million 
in addition to the restructuring  the company announced its intent to sell the company s digital document products division ddpd  which sells print and scan image accelerator products 
ddpd also includes the assets of seaport imaging seaport  which was acquired in august for million  including direct acquisition costs  of which million was paid at closing and in promissory notes payable over two years 
the sale of ddpd has been accounted for as discontinued operations resulting in a loss of million  including the loss on the sale and the loss from discontinued operations 
all comparative financial statements have been restated to reflect this accounting treatment 
on august   the company announced the sale of substantially all of the assets of ddpd for consideration consisting of future royalties on ggx s sales of products purchased in the transaction through september or until royalties reach an aggregate of million  assumption of certain liabilities  and promissory notes totaling million payable in and  subject to collection of receivables sold in the transaction 
the company derives its revenue primarily from sales of its printer software products  which include revenue from software licenses  royalties  engineering and manufacturing services and maintenance 
software license revenue consists of the company s charges for licensed source code  which generally includes initial non refundable fees which are recognized as revenue upon the shipment of the source code  provided there are no significant vendor obligations 
royalty revenue is generally earned as a percentage of net revenue or a fixed amount from unit sales by licensees of products that incorporate the company s software  and is generally recognized as earned in the company s financial statements in the quarter in which amounts due to the company have been determined using estimates based upon historical payments 
engineering services revenue is derived from fees paid for porting of the company s software to customer specific printer controllers and is recognized as revenue as the services are performed or using percentage of completion contract accounting 
manufacturing services revenue is derived from fees received for providing design and manufacturing coordination and support on behalf of the oem 
these fees are earned over the manufacturing period 
payments under maintenance contracts are due at the beginning of the contract  however  revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is typically twelve months 
the company generates a significant portion of its revenue from customers located outside of the united states 
such revenue accounted for  and of the company s net revenue for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
the company s export revenue is primarily denominated and collected in united states dollars 
in march  the company entered into an amendment of its preexisting development and license agreement with hewlett packard the hp agreement 
under the hp agreement  the company licensed certain of its page description technology  including its version of the postscript page description language  to hewlett packard 
revenue from the hp agreement will be recognized by the company over three years using percentage of completion contract accounting 
such revenue accounted for  and of the company s net revenue for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
payments under the hp agreement include the company s charges for source code access  engineering services  license rights and ongoing maintenance and support 
in june  the company entered into a new agreement with hewlett packard the hp agreement that will result in an ongoing revenue stream beyond the existing contract at levels nearly comparable with the existing agreement 
hewlett packard has the right to terminate the hp agreement upon a failure by the company to comply with any of the provisions of the hp agreement that is not cured within days  and upon the commencement of certain bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings involving the company 
under the hp agreement revenue will end in february  although cash payments will continue until december under the hp agreement which expires in december  the company will develop  license and support new page description languages 
a substantial portion of the company s operating expenses are related to research and development 
in addition to expenses for the ongoing development of printer systems products  the company has committed significant resources to the development of multifunction peripheral technology from which the company does not expect to recognize any material revenue in the short term 
as part of the restructuring announced in june  the company included as non recurring cost of revenue a million charge representing certain costs under contracts with ricoh  including the future costs to complete the development of an mfp 
under the contract  ricoh made a certain level of guaranteed payments to the company for the mfp development 
however  the estimated cost to complete now exceeds any further development payments from ricoh  which as required by generally accepted accounting principles  results in the immediate recognition of the loss 
once the mfp is deployed by ricoh  which is anticipated for the fall  the company will receive a royalty on each unit shipped 
the ricoh mfp is the first product to include the xipchip  an integrated asic for multifunctional devices  which the company intends to market to other manufacturers of mfps 
also as part of the restructuring the company implemented a workforce reduction of approximately  predominantly in the marketing and administrative areas 
this workforce reduction coupled with the sale of ddpd has brought the company s total personnel down to from a high of approximately reached during fiscal the company intends to maintain its current level of staffing and will increase its engineering expenses to meet specific customer sponsored engineering services requirements 
the company had no provision for income taxes for fiscal due to net losses incurred in the period 
in fiscal and  the company recorded a tax provision of approximately  and  respectively 
in fiscal  the provision relates primarily to taxes on foreign operations which do not benefit from loss carryforwards 
as of june   the company had available net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for us federal income tax reporting purposes 
these carryforwards may be used to offset future taxable income  if any and are subject to review and possible adjustment by the internal revenue service 
results of operations the following table summarizes the company s significant operating results as a percentage of net revenue for each of the periods indicated 
year ended june  net revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative non recurring charges charge for purchased research and development loss from operations other income expense  net income loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes income loss from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations net income loss fiscal years ended june  and june  revenue 
revenue totaled million in fiscal  essentially flat with fiscal revenue of million 
however  the components of revenue changed between the years 
in  revenues from sales of manufactured boards and customer sponsored engineering services that were subcontracted directly to third parties increased to of revenue in vs 
in revenues from the sale of driver software increased to approximately of revenue in vs 
in offsetting these increases were decreases in revenues from royalties and licensing of the company s pdl software products  including revenue recognized under the hp agreement  which represented approximately of fiscal revenue compared to approximately in the decline in royalty and license revenue resulted primarily from the reduction in royalties from lexmark on printers that incorporated the company s ips printer language software  but which had reached the end of their product life  and a decline in the recognition of revenue under the hp agreement 
hewlett packard represented of revenue in vs 
in also offsetting the increase in revenue was revenue recognized on the development contract of the mfp which declined to approximately of revenue in vs 
approximately in gross profit 
gross profit declined to million  or of revenue  in versus million  or of revenue  in the decline in gross profit was primarily attributable to two factors 
the first was the inclusion in of non recurring charges of million related to the losses on certain contracts with ricoh  primarily related to the future costs to complete the mfp 
excluding the non recurring cost of revenue  gross profit would have been approximately versus for the prior year 
the second factor was the inclusion in revenue of manufactured boards and customer sponsored engineering services contracted to third parties which carry very little gross margin 
it is the intent of the company to structure these activities such that they will not be included in revenue or cost of revenue in future periods 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  costs of engineering contractors and outside consultants  engineering supplies  computer equipment depreciation and overhead costs  all of which are associated with development of the company s ips  mfp  driver software and color technologies 
research and development expenses increased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal the higher expense level resulted primarily from increased personnel expenditures  particularly outside contractors hired to complete the development of the mfp 
as a percentage of revenue  research and development expenses increased to for fiscal from for fiscal selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses include personnel and related overhead costs for sales  marketing  finance  human resources and general management 
selling  general and administrative expenses remained fairly constant  decreasing to million for fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal non recurring charges 
the company recognized non recurring operating charges in of million related to the write down of intangible assets which were deemed to have no future value  the provision for severance payments related to a workforce reduction and management restructuring  and provision for lease expense on excess facilities 
charge for purchased research and development 
the charge in fiscal for purchased research and development represents the february  acquisition of gca gesellschaft fur computer anwendung mbh gca  freiberg neckar  germany  a leading developer of printer drivers for the worldwide multifunction and printer peripheral market the gca acquisition 
the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of gca in a million cash transaction through its wholly owned subsidiary xionics document technologies gmbh  dortmund  germany 
the gca acquisition resulted in a charge of million for purchased in process research and development costs 
this amount represents the value of acquired in process research and development projects as determined by an independent appraisal 
the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the technology had no alternative future use 
the technology acquired in the gca acquisition has required substantial additional development by the company 
other income expense  net 
net other income  consisting primarily of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents  totaled  in versus  in interest income in declined as cash and cash equivalents declined during however  offsetting this decline in interest income was a decline in interest expense from the interest expense included bank lines of credit and a note payable to a shareholder  which were repaid in full by december  from the proceeds of the company s ipo 
discontinued operations 
in june the company announced its intent to sell the company s digital document products division ddpd  which sells print and scan image accelerator products 
ddpd also includes the assets of seaport imaging seaport  which was acquired in august for million 
the sale of ddpd has been accounted for as discontinued operations resulting in a loss of million  including the loss on ddpd operations of million and an estimated loss on the disposal of the business  its assets and liabilities of approximately million 
on august   the company announced the sale of substantially all of the assets of ddpd for consideration consisting of the future royalties on gcx s sales of products purchased in the transaction through september or until royalties reach an aggregate of million  assumption of certain liabilities  and promissory notes totaling million payable in and  subject to collection of receivables sold in the transaction 
fiscal years ended june  and june  revenue 
revenue increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase resulted primarily from growth in royalties and licensing revenues of the company s printer software products  including approximately million of incremental revenue recognized under the hp agreement 
also contributing to the increase were development fees earned on the development contract for an mfp and revenue earned on the development and sale of software drivers for printers 
gross profit 
cost of revenue consists primarily of costs associated with non recurring engineering services  amortization of acquired intangibles and the cost of providing services and maintenance 
gross profit increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal gross margin percentage declined to for fiscal compared to for fiscal the slight decline is attributable to a higher content of services revenue in which has a lower margin than royalty and license revenue 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  costs of engineering contractors and outside consultants  engineering supplies  computer equipment depreciation and overhead costs  all of which are associated with development of the company s ips  mfp and imaging technologies 
research and development expenses increased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal the higher expense level resulted primarily from increased expenditures relating to the company s mfp  pdl and color technologies 
as a percentage of revenue  research and development expenses decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses include personnel and related overhead costs for sales  marketing  finance  human resources and general management 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal charge for purchased research and development 
in february  the company completed the acquisition of gca gesellschaft fur computer anwendung mbh gca  freiberg neckar  germany  a leading developer of printer drivers for the worldwide multifunction and printer peripheral market the gca acquisition 
the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of gca in a million cash transaction through its wholly owned subsidiary xionics document technologies gmbh  dortmund  germany 
the gca acquisition resulted in a charge of million for purchased in process research and development costs 
this amount represents the value of acquired in process research and development projects as determined by an independent appraisal 
the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the technology had no alternative future use 
the technology acquired in the gca acquisition has required substantial additional development by the company 
other income expense  net 
net other income expense  consisting primarily of interest income offset by interest expense  totaled  in versus an expense of  in the decrease in interest expense resulted primarily from the reduction in bank lines of credit and a note payable to a shareholder  which were repaid in full by december  the increase in interest income resulted primarily from increased cash and cash equivalent balances as a result of receiving net proceeds from the company s september  initial public offering 
discontinued operations 
in  discontinued operations includes the operating income revenue less operating expenses and a provision for taxes related to ddpd which the company treated as discontinued operations in fiscal financial statements based on the june announcement of its intention to sell this division 
as a result of this accounting treatment all comparative financial statements have been restated to reflect the operating results of ddpd as discontinued operations 
liquidity and capital resources at june   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million  a decrease of million from the million of cash and cash equivalents at june  this decrease is primarily due to the net cash used in operating activities including the net loss for fiscal  as well as cash spent in acquiring seaport in september at present  the company has available a million working capital revolving line of credit and a million term loan facility with a bank  both of which are secured by substantially all assets of the company 
the working capital line of credit terminates on december   although the company expects the credit agreement to be extended beyond the expiration date 
as of june   there were no outstanding borrowings under the working capital line of credit or term loan facility 
it is possible that the company may in the future use private or public sales of its securities as a source of liquidity 
the company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalent balances  together with funds generated from operations  cash payments on the hp agreement which continue through december and available borrowings under its loan facilities  will be sufficient to finance the company s operations for at least the next months 
in the event the company acquires one or more businesses or products  the company s capital requirements could increase substantially  and there can be no assurance that additional capital will be available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
factors affecting future results dependence on relationship with hewlett packard 
the company derived of its revenue from hewlett packard in fiscal therefore  any significant disruption or deterioration of its relationship with hewlett packard would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company has met all of its obligations necessary to secure the right to receive ongoing payments from hewlett packard under its agreement with hewlett packard discussed above  and is also current in performing its obligations under various other less material agreements it has with hewlett packard 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to meet all such obligations in the future 
hewlett packard has the right to terminate each of its agreements with the company if the company breaches its obligations under that agreement and does not cure such breach within days 
in addition  competitors of the company  including without limitation adobe and peerless  are continuously engaged in efforts to win hewlett packard s business away from the company  and are likely to continue such efforts in the future 
there can be no assurance that one or more of the company s competitors will not be successful in competing with the company for some or all of hewlett packard s business 
further  although hewlett packard has shown a strong tendency to outsource embedded systems software and development for its printer products over the past several years  there can be no assurance that this trend will continue or that hewlett packard s internal development groups will not compete successfully for some or all of this outsourced business in the future 
finally  any adverse change in hewlett packard s business  results of operations or financial condition could in turn have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on market success of third parties 
the markets for the company s products and services are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and needs  and frequent new product introductions 
the company currently derives substantially all of its revenue from the licensing of technology  including royalty streams derived from oems shipments of document imaging devices containing the company s products  and the sale of related products and services to manufacturers of document imaging devices 
the company anticipates that these sources of revenue will continue to account for substantially all of its revenue for the foreseeable future 
in order to assure that the company will derive future royalty streams from the shipment of oem devices  the company and its oems are required to develop and release in a regular and timely manner new document imaging products with increased speed  enhanced output resolutions  reduced memory requirements  multiple functions  and network connectivity 
the company s oems are under tremendous pressure to continually shorten the development cycles of these products  leading to increased complexity and cost of development to the company and its oems 
the company s success will depend on  among other things market acceptance of the company s technology and the document imaging devices of the company s oems  the ability of the company and its oems to meet industry changes and market demands in a timely manner  achievement of new design wins by the company  successful implementation of the company s technology in new document imaging devices being developed by its oems  and successful marketing of those devices by the oems 
any failure by the company or its oems to anticipate or respond adequately to the rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards and needs in the market for document imaging devices could result in a loss of competitiveness or revenue  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
product development  product delays 
the company has in the past experienced delays in development of its products and in implementation of those products in its customers document imaging devices 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience similar  or more severe  delays in the future 
prior delays have resulted from numerous factors such as changing oem product specifications  difficulties in allocating engineering personnel among competing projects  other resource limitations  difficulties with independent contractors  changing market or competitive requirements and unanticipated engineering complexity 
there can be no assurance that these or other factors will not contribute to future delays  that oems will tolerate such delays  or that delayed document imaging devices  once introduced  will meet with market acceptance or success 
given the short product life cycles in the market for document imaging devices  any delay or unanticipated difficulty associated with new product development or introduction could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
competition 
the market for the company s products and services is intensely competitive  and the company has numerous competitors  including not only other suppliers of outsourced products and services such as peerless systems corporation  but its oem customers own internal development groups as well 
the company s page description language interpreter products compete directly with those of adobe systems  inc  which is substantially larger than the company and has significantly greater resources and name recognition than the company 
in addition  the company s oem customers compete fiercely with one another  and with other manufacturers of document imaging devices  for market share in a market characterized by rapid development cycles  short product life cycles  and ever increasing consumer demand for greater performance and functionality at reduced prices 
there can be no assurance that the company or its oems will be able to compete successfully against their respective current or future competitors  or that competitive pressures faced by the company and its oems will not have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations or financial condition 
technological change developing markets 
a substantial portion of the company s recent development effort has been directed at the development of new embedded imaging technologies  including next generation pdls  the xipchip family of asics  other foundation technology for mfps  and embedded digital color copier technology 
while the company has substantial experience in certain of these areas  it has limited experience in others 
the company s future success will depend to a significant degree on its ability to complete development of these technologies and have them deployed in oems document imaging devices 
this success will be dependent in part on the ability of the company s oems to develop new products that provide the functionality  performance  speed  and connectivity demanded by the market at acceptable prices  and to convince end users to adopt new generations of products for office and desktop use 
there can be no assurance that the market for mfp  color imaging and other products will develop or continue to expand as currently anticipated by the company  that the company s oem customers will choose the company s technology for use in their printers  mfps  color copiers or other devices  that the company s oem customers will be successful in developing or introducing such devices  or that such products will gain market acceptance 
the failure of any of these events to occur could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
likewise  there can be no assurance that future changes in the technological or marketing direction of industry leaders such as microsoft corporation or intel corporation for example  the possibility that microsoft may include native print rendering capability in future versions of its personal computer operating systems will not render the company s key products such as printer languages  interpreters and drivers obsolete or reduce market demand for them 
any such developments could also have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
investment in ricoh mfp and xipchip 
the company has made a substantial investment in research and development in order to create a family of mfp devices for its customer ricoh co  ltd  and to develop its xipchip asics for use in those devices 
while shipment of commercial volumes of the first ricoh mfp containing xionics mfp technology is expected to occur during the second quarter of the company s fiscal year  there can be no assurance that ricoh will be successful in marketing or selling such product  or that it will sell sufficient quantities of current or future mfps based on xionics technology to enable xionics to recoup its investment in the development of such devices 
similarly  there can be no assurance that the company will succeed in marketing current or future versions of the xipchip asics to other customers in addition to ricoh  or that it will sell production units of xipchips in sufficient quantities to recoup its investment in the development thereof 
asian economic crisis 
the company has several significant oem customers in japan  south korea  and other parts of asia 
the adverse economic circumstances currently prevailing in japan and elsewhere in asia could affect these customers willingness or ability to do business with the company in the future or their success in developing and launching document imaging devices containing the company s products  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
during  the company derived of its revenue from mita digital design  inc mdd  a wholly owned us subsidiary of mita industrial co  ltd 
mita  and other affiliates of mita 
mita  a japanese corporation  petitioned the japanese court for reorganization on august   in a proceeding analogous although not identical to a chapter bankruptcy filing in the united states 
while mdd and mita s other international subsidiaries have stated publicly that they do not anticipate any immediate effect on their ability to do business as the result of mita s reorganization  these subsidiaries derive a significant portion of their operating revenue from mita 
therefore there can be no assurance that mita s reorganization will not affect its subsidiaries willingness or ability to continue to do business with the company at the levels experienced during fiscal  or at all 
further  there can be no assurance that other japanese or asian customers of the company will not also enter reorganization or bankruptcy as the result of the asian economic situation 
one or more of the company s significant asian customers entering reorganization or bankruptcy could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
risks associated with provision of controller design and manufacturing services 
the company provides comprehensive services for the management and coordination of the design and manufacturing of controller boards for its oem customers by third parties 
the company seeks to confine its role in such arrangements to that of agent for the oem 
however  in response to customer or supplier requirements the company has at times assumed contractual responsibility for the delivery of development deliverables and manufactured boards 
there can be no assurance that the company will not incur liability to its customers as the result of its third party contractors failure or inability to develop and manufacture controller boards for such oems as agreed 
recruitment and retention of employees 
the company s future success is dependent in part upon its ability to attract and retain qualified employees  especially highly skilled engineering and technical employees 
the current labor market  both in the company s geographical area and in the high technology industry in general  is such that the number of open positions in these disciplines far exceeds the supply of personnel qualified to fill them 
in consequence  the company must continually compete with other high technology employers for this limited pool of available employees 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract or retain the employees it needs to execute against its current or future business plans 
any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the year many computer programs written during approximately the past years use two digits rather than four to identify a calendar year  and a number of these programs are still in widespread use 
such programs could recognize a date represented as as the calendar year rather than the calendar year when performing date sensitive operations 
this in turn could cause the programs to generate erroneous data or fail when called upon to perform date sensitive operations using the year or subsequent years 
although the company believes its products and systems are year compliant  the company utilizes third party equipment and software which may not be year compliant 
failure of such third party equipment or software to operate properly with regard to dates in the year and subsequent years could require the company to incur unanticipated expenses to remedy any problems  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
furthermore  the purchasing patterns of customers or potential customers may be affected by year issues as companies expend significant resources to correct their current systems for year compliance 
these expenditures may result in reduced funds available to purchase products and services such as those offered by the company  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
because the company licenses and provides services relating to embedded software and firmware  the company may become involved in investigations or allegations regarding year issues 
the company believes its current products are year compliant and do not require modification to function correctly in and after the year accordingly  the company does not anticipate any material exposure arising from year issues relating to its own products and services 
to date  the company has not spent a material amount on year expenditures and does not anticipate further expenditures to be material to its financial position or results of operations in any given year 
however  the company s software and firmware is often commingled with that of its customers or other vendors when such software and firmware is incorporated in the customers products  and the company has no knowledge of the year readiness of such third parties software and firmware 
therefore  the company cannot anticipate the degree to which it could be the subject of claims or complaints regarding year issues 
factors affecting stock price 
the market price of the company s common stock has been  and may continue to be  subject to significant fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in the company s operating results  announcements of technological innovations or strategic relationships by the company or its competitors  and other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market in recent months and years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have affected the market price of the stock of many technology companies  and in particular those with small market capitalizations 
these fluctuations  as well as general economic and market conditions  may materially and adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments 
the company does not participate in derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under sfas no 
 or derivative commodity instruments 
all of the company s investments are in short term  investment grade commercial paper and money market accounts that are carried at fair value on the company s books 
accordingly  the company has no quantitative information concerning the market risk of participating in such investments 
primary market risk exposures 
the company s primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the company s investment portfolio of cash equivalents is subject to interest rate fluctuations  but the company believes this risk is immaterial due to the short term nature of these investments 
substantially all of the company s business outside the united states is conducted in us dollar denominated transactions  whereas the company s operating expenses in japan and germany are denominated in local currency 
the company has no foreign exchange contracts  option contracts or other foreign hedging arrangements 
however  the company believes that the operating expenses of its foreign operations are immaterial  and therefore any associated market risk is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition
