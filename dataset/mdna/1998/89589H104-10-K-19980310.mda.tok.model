while this outlook represents management s current judgment on the future direction of the business  such risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 
the company undertakes no obligation to release publicly the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date hereof 
overview triangle is engaged in the development of new drug candidates primarily in the antiviral area 
since its inception on july   the company s operating activities have related primarily to recruiting personnel  negotiating license and option arrangements for its drug candidates  raising capital and developing its drug candidates 
the company has not received any revenues from the sale of products and does not expect any of its drug candidates to be commercially available until at least the year as of december   the company s accumulated deficit was approximately million and the company had utilized approximately million of cash 
the company s drug development programs require substantial capital expenditures  including expenditures for preclinical testing  chemical synthetic scale up  manufacture of drug substance for clinical trials and toxicology studies  clinical trials of drug candidates and payments to the company s licensors 
the company has been unprofitable since its inception and expects to incur substantial and increasing losses for at least the next several years  due primarily to the expansion of its drug development programs 
the company will also require substantial capital expenditures relating to activities many of which may need to occur prior to  and in anticipation of  the potential regulatory approval of its drug candidates  including expenditures associated with the establishment of a sales and marketing organization  the manufacture of drug substance  the development of a distribution system with outside vendors and other administrative expenditures necessary to support the company 
many of these capital expenditures may be incurred irrespective of whether the company s drug candidates are approved when anticipated or at all 
the company expects that losses will fluctuate from period to period and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
see item business risks and uncertainties history of operating losses  accumulated deficit  uncertainty of future profitability 
the company has only a limited operating history upon which an evaluation of the company and its prospects can be based 
the risks  expenses and difficulties encountered by companies at an early stage of development must be considered when evaluating the company s prospects 
to address these risks  the company must  among other things  successfully develop and commercialize its drug candidates  secure all necessary proprietary rights  respond to competitive developments and continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in addressing these risks 
see item business risks and uncertainties development stage company  uncertainty of product development 
the operating expenses of the company will depend on several factors  including the level of development expenses and the potential commercialization of its drug candidates 
development expenses will depend on the progress and results of the company s drug development efforts  which the company cannot predict 
management may in some cases be able to control the timing of development expenses in part by accelerating or decelerating preclinical testing and clinical trial activities 
the level of expenses relating to the establishment of a sales and marketing organization  the manufacture of drug substance  the development of a distribution system with outside vendors and other administrative expenditures will depend on the success of the development of the company s drug candidates  however  many of these capital expenditures may be incurred irrespective of whether the company s drug candidates are approved when anticipated or at all 
as a result of these factors  the company believes that period to period comparisons are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is possible that the company s operating results will be below the expectations of market analysts and investors 
in such event  the prevailing market price of the common stock could be materially adversely affected

the company expects its capital expenditures to increase in future periods 
in conjunction with the development of its drug candidates  the company outsources certain aspects of clinical trials and focuses on what it believes are the most critical aspects of the development process 
accordingly  the company has entered into contractual arrangements with selected third parties for certain aspects of its drug development 
although the commitment under these contracts is dependent upon results of the underlying clinical and toxicology studies  the company s management estimates the commitment to be approximately million at december   and immaterial at december  the company expects that its capital requirements will increase substantially in future periods as the company funds its drug development programs  develops a sales and marketing organization  acquires drug substance from third party manufacturers  develops a distribution system with outside vendors and incurs other administrative expenditures necessary to support the company 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the progress of the company s drug development programs  the magnitude of these programs  the scope and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials  the cost  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  costs under the license and or option agreements relating to the company s drug candidates including the costs of obtaining patent protection for the company s drug candidates  the timing and the terms of the acquisition of any additional drug candidates  the rate of technological advances  determinations as to the commercial potential of the company s drug candidates  administrative and legal expenses  the establishment of internal capacity and third party arrangements for sales and marketing functions  the establishment of third party arrangements for manufacturing and other factors 
amounts payable by the company in the future under its existing license agreements are uncertain due to a number of factors  including the progress of the company s drug development programs  the company s ability to obtain approval to commercialize any drug candidate and the commercial success of any approved drug 
the company s existing license agreements and the merger agreement with avid  as of december   require future payments of up to million in cash and up to  shares of common stock contingent upon the achievement of certain development milestones 
one of the company s licensors has the option to receive million of such future milestone payments in shares of common stock based on the then current market price in lieu of a cash payment 
additionally  the company will pay royalties based on a percentage of net sales of each licensed product incorporating these drug candidates 
most of the company s license agreements require minimum royalty payments after regulatory approval 
depending on the company s success and timing in obtaining regulatory approval  aggregate annual minimum royalty payments could range from  if only a single drug candidate is approved for one indication to million if all drug candidates are approved for all indications under the company s existing license agreements 
on february   the company executed a license agreement with bukwang for l fmau  the company s eighth licensed drug candidate  for the treatment of hbv and all other human antiviral applications 
the company paid a license initiation fee of million and will be required to make development milestone payments of up to million and sales milestone payments of up to million 
the company is also required to make annual minimum royalty payments beginning the third year after fda registration is granted for the first licensed product

the company will be required to meet certain milestone obligations and to conduct and fund certain development work with respect to l fmau 
the company believes that its existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be adequate to satisfy its anticipated capital requirements through january the company expects that it will be required to raise substantial additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or from other sources 
there can be no assurance that additional funding will be available on favorable terms from any of these sources or at all

litigation and other contingencies as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company is indirectly involved in several opposition and interference proceedings and one lawsuit filed in australia regarding the patent rights related to three of its licensed drug candidates  including ftc 
although the company is not a named party in any of these proceedings  it is obligated to reimburse its licensors for certain legal expenses associated with these proceedings 
the company cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings 
the company believes that an adverse judgment would not result in a material financial obligation to the company  nor would the company have to recognize an impairment under statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for impairment of long lived assets as no amounts have been capitalized related to these drug candidates 
however  any development in these proceedings adverse to the company s interests  including but not limited to any adverse development related to the patent rights licensed to the company for these three drug candidates or the company s rights or obligations related thereto  could have a material adverse effect on the company s future consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flow

recent accounting pronouncements effective december   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
earnings per share sfas and will adopt statement of financial accounting standard no
