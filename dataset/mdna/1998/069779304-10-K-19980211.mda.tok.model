continuing operations overview the company has been engaged since in the development of products for the regulated manufacturing industry and  most recently  computerized manufacturing execution systems mes for the pharmaceutical and medical device industry 
although no assurances can be given  the company believes the pharmaceutical and medical device market for mes is poised to grow rapidly over the next few years due to the pressure for compliance with regulations promulgated by the fda and the international standards organization iso in addition to the need to continuously reduce costs to remain competitive 
the company believes it has developed a premier  standardized  pc based system with the necessary functionality and documented support required by the pharmaceutical and medical device industry to assist it in reducing cost while remaining in compliance with fda and iso requirements and  although no assurances can be given  considers that its continuing investment in this evolving product area could provide it with a leadership position in this market with the potential for substantial growth and the expansion of its product opportunities into other regulated areas such as the food  cosmetic  and chemical industries 
during the sales and marketing activity for the year ended october   the company recognized a continuing need to provide detailed demonstrations of its products approximating actual customer requirements and believes that additional sales and technical personnel are required to satisfy this need 
in addition  the company believes that its mes is compliant with industry standards such as good automated manufacturing practices gamp  an industry standard  that it is beneficial to continually upgrade its program of compliance with gamp and has therefore  in pursuit of its continuing program to upgrade its compliance programs added additional quality and project personnel 
the expenses for such personnel are in addition to those which management believes should be expended in in the development of new products based on pharm such expenses include the salary and overhead costs of software item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued development and quality personnel developing standard features to add to pharm the company believes these are needed to improve the profitability of the product by reducing the need to provide specific enhancements to individual customers 
by reducing the need to provide specific enhancements for individual customers  management believes that  while no assurances can be given  there will be a reduction in the time between order placement and revenue recognition with a reduced cost of sales 
the additional staff in sales  customer service  quality assurance and technical personnel create expenses in advance of the revenues which they are intended to develop and act to increase losses until such revenues are generated 
the company believes its objective of being the leading supplier of mes to the pharmaceutical industry requires the incurrance of these costs and their consequences 
the company believes there is a compelling need for pharmaceutical manufacturers to have mes compliant with cgmp as established by the fda 
because of fda approval of electronic signatures  the company believes manufacturers are now less reluctant to employ computerized mes systems such as the mes products offered by the company 
the company considers the additional costs of compliance to gamp to be a prudent investment 
the company  however  cannot be assured that pharmaceutical manufacturers may not find other ways to satisfy regulatory requirements 
the installation of a mes is a complex process involving integration with existing hardware platforms and systems 
a significant factor in successful field installation is the ability of customer personnel to understand the system and  in addition to participating in the training required  to accommodate the difference between standard paper systems and electronic methodology 
in addition  the system must undergo rigorous testing after installation and may require an extended period of modifications to fully comply with customer requirements  some of which may be at the company s expense 
as assurance that the company intends to support its products  the company is currently providing  at company expense  the services of five to eight developers to assist in field installations in view of delivery delays to certain customers 
although no assurances can be given  the company believes the current need for field support may be reduced during as additional systems are installed 
the company from time to time agrees to penalty clauses for delivery  some of which may be exercised with the corresponding reduction in revenue and a negative impact on profitability 
for use in a manufacturing environment  the system generally has to undergo validation in accordance with defined procedures determining its fitness for use in a regulated environment 
the company currently has two systems installed and validated at a medical device manufacturing plant and a pharmaceutical manufacturing plant 
one additional pharmasyst registered trademark product and one additional pharm product are believed to have completed the testing necessary for validation but have not been formally declared validated by the customer and no assurances can be given that such validation will be formalized 
customers are provided the right to cancel at no cost early in the contract cycle if the parties do not agree on the applicable specifications for the pharm software to be installed 
although the company has made eight deliveries of pharmasyst registered trademark and pharm applications  ten other deliveries of pharm continue to be overdue 
deliveries have been and are being delayed because of the company s failure to accurately estimate the time required to complete certain software enhancements to pharm required to meet individual customer requirements  including requirements revised by the customer after initial bids were submitted or agreements signed 
the company has recently adopted a policy of requiring  wherever practical  customer participation in a walk through of the standard software before requirements are fixed to avoid misunderstandings and  while no assurances can be given  the company believes that this practice will reduce the probability of lateness due to changing requirements 
in order to maintain customer relations  the company accepted responsibility for changes without requesting additional funds item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued or extension of delivery dates 
cancellation for late deliveries may occur and two already have occurred  and  while no assurances can be given  the company does not anticipate the loss of material orders as a result thereof 
contracts to deliver software which require significant customization or modification for an extended period of time are accounted for under the percentage of completion method 
for products or orders which are more standardized in nature  revenue is recognized on delivery 
in  the company determined that its pharm product had become standardized and  generally  pharm license fees are recognized as revenue upon delivery of standard pharm  revenue for customization is recognized on a percent completion basis  and revenue from other services is recognized as rendered 
the company did not incur any material expenses in the cancellation of these two orders since both involved the provision of standard software under development as pharm  which proceeded without additional cost regardless of the cancellations 
if the company had been able to complete the development of pharm earlier  these two cancellations could have been prevented and the company could have recognized additional revenue of approximately  while the company cannot predict customer willingness to wait for the completion of deliveries and other cancellations may occur  the company does not believe a material portion of its backlog will be canceled 
software development expenditures are expensed as research and development until a product attains technological feasibility 
thereafter  expenditures are capitalized until products attain commercial viability 
the company established technological feasibility for pharmasyst registered trademark in at the end of and including development of pharm  pharmasyst registered trademark had a capitalized value of million after allowing for amortization 
development expenditures for pharmasyst registered trademark and other commercial products have consisted primarily of salaries of software engineers and quality assurance staff plus applicable allocated overhead 
the amortization period for pharmasyst registered trademark and pharm is scheduled to be complete by june and until then will have a significant effect on earnings 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company reviewed the recoverability of its capitalized software costs and determined that neither prenval nor the product then marketed as upacs would achieve sufficient revenues in future periods to justify retention of the related capitalized costs 
accordingly  the company wrote off the million balance of such capitalized costs 
with respect to prenval  it became apparent to the company that market acceptance of the product was less than anticipated 
the company also determined that the licensee had no current plans to market the product in the us as was originally anticipated by the company and that  as a result  sales would not exceed the amount necessary to generate royalties in excess of the minimum provided under the license and the company determined to suspend further development of prenval 
however  the company will provide technical and marketing support for the remainder of the license term 
the company believes that the use of its marketing and technical staff to support the sale of prenval throughout the balance of the license term is an effective way to develop the potential for an extension of the license term and does not represent a material cost to the company 
with respect to upacs  the company had implemented sales efforts in late and displayed the product at certain trade shows in europe 
in december  sales were anticipated for early however  by early april it became clear that the anticipated sales would not materialize 
the company concluded that the product  as it then existed  would not generate sufficient sales to recover the capitalized costs and that only a new product designed for networking with communications and off line measurement capabilities would be capable of producing acceptable sales volume 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of discontinued operations during  the gtd was engaged primarily in the development of the interference blanking unit based on a contract awarded to the gtd in may in addition  the gtd completed the development of the maintenance data recorder development contract awarded in april and continued the development of the electronics for the slam er missile project which the gtd was awarded in late fiscal compared to fiscal continuing operations revenues mtd revenues in increased to million compared with million in due to increases in deliveries of pharm revenues were below expectations primarily due to the delays in completing certain software tasks 
while no assurances can be given  the company has initiated changes in the method of estimating and measuring software development and anticipates improvements in efficiency and cost as well as shorter delivery times 
cost of sales cost of sales in was million compared with million in cost of sales increased because labor and overhead component costs of inventory increased primarily due to additional software development and test personnel in both the new jersey and united kingdom facilities 
further enhancements to the core software pharm are no longer being capitalized since deliveries of the standard product began at the end of the second quarter of although no assurances can be given  the company believes that a combination of increased prices  increased deliveries  and product development now underway to reduce the need for enhancements will result in a decline in unit cost of sales later in amortization of software development costs capitalization of the core software for pharm was completed at the end of the second quarter since deliveries of early standard versions of pharm began at that time 
amortization of software development costs increased from million in to million in selling  general and administrative expenses mtd selling  general and administrative expenses in were million compared with million in selling costs increased by million due primarily to an increase of million in consulting fees and modest increases in sales commissions and personnel costs 
there were increases in almost all general and administrative expense categories  the largest of which was inclusion of million  the fair market value of options and warrants issued to non employee consultants for service rendered during the fair market value was determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
in addition  a reserve of million was recorded to cover potential cost overruns and penalties 
cost overruns are attributed to the failure to accurately estimate the cost of certain software projects and to the aggressive pricing policies the mtd followed to secure the desired market share 
while no assurances can be given  the company believes that current high priority development activities intended to add standard features to pharm are expected to reduce the amount of enhancements required for future customers 
the reduction in enhancement required for individual customers reduces the amount of software development and the consequent potential for cost overruns 
penalty costs are incurred from time to time item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued because of lateness in delivery 
while no assurance can be given  the company believes that by reducing the need for enhancements the ability to meet schedule commitments will be improved 
interest expense interest expense in was million compared with 
million in and includes interest on the capitalized lease of 
million 
the difference in expense is related to interest paid on the million convertible debenture issued in and the million convertible debenture issued in the million convertible debenture which has an annual interest rate of was outstanding for less than three months in but was outstanding throughout the million convertible debenture which has an annual interest rate of did not exist in and was outstanding for five months in continuing losses the mtd incurred a loss before taxes of million in compared to a loss before taxes of million in the loss was reduced to million by an income tax benefit of 
million 
a major portion of the loss in compared to is attributable to the million increased amortization  the additional reserves for cost overruns and penalties of million  and million  which is the fair market value of options and warrants issued to non employee consultants for services rendered during the increase in labor costs of million  the increase in interest cost of million  the increased selling costs of million  and the increased overhead costs of million all contributed to the loss 
the company expects additional losses in including amortization expense estimated to be million 
the company s ability to achieve profitable operations is dependent upon  among other things  the completion of current development and testing activities for pharm  timely delivery and successful installation and validation of its systems by its customers  and successful competition in the markets in which the company participates 
the loss included a write off of various capitalized expenses in the sum of million representing development of the company s prenatal abnormality detection software  prenval  and early development costs of upacs as well as other operating losses including interest and amortization of million 
the major portion of the operating loss represented the company s continuing investment in the development of markets and infrastructure for the mes business 
readiness for the year the company has taken actions to understand the nature and extent of the work required to make its systems and infrastructure year compliant 
the company has determined that it does not have any material year problem with its products and believes  based on available information  that it will be able to manage its total year transition without any material adverse effect on business operations or financial prospects 
while no assurances can be given  the company anticipates converting all of its present infrastructure software systems to currently available software products which are already year compliant 
the company cannot anticipate the impact of suppliers and vendors non compliance with the year discontinued operations the gtd incurred a net loss of million in compared to a net loss of million in the gtd loss in consisted primarily of operating losses incurred because of reduced revenues without the corresponding reduction in operating expenses  and  a loss of million on the gtd sale
