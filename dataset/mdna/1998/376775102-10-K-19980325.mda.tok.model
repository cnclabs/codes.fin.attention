results of operations for the years ended december  and  the six months ended december  and the year ended june  overview the company fundamental vision is to remain a low cost profitable producer 
while the company has achieved greater productionin  at lower costs  the company must remain cognisant of the gold price 
the downturn in the price of gold during has been a concern to the company 
management s approach to this problem included a revision of the mine plan at the rand mine to reduce costs  a cost containment program at all facilities and a new hedging strategy for a limited amount of future gold production 
in addition  the company underwent a management restructuring in december the new management team is mandated to review and optimize the company s operations and administrationwith a view to maximizing the company s resources 
at the same time the board has directed management to seek out growth opportunities which take advantage of lower acquisition costs available as a result ofthe lower gold price and weak junior share market conditions 
gold production during  operations focused primarily on the rand mine and picacho mine 
on a consolidated basis goldproduction for the year ended december  was  ounces an increase of  ounces or over the ounces produced in the year ended december  the production of  was an increase of over the annualized production rate reported for the six months ended december  the production for the year ended december  compares favourably to the projection made in last year s report anticipating production of  to  ounces of gold for fiscal the company expects that gold production for the year ended december  will be in the range of  to  ounces 
presuming the successful completion of permitting on the imperial project by the third quarterof and improvements in the price of gold  construction could commence during the third quarter of if this occurs  the company could expect gold production for the year ended december  to be approximately  ounces 
total gold production for the six months ended december  was  or a decrease on an annualized basis  from the  ounces of gold produced for the year ended june  this decrease in production was the result of an unexpected low recovery rate for gold on the unoxidized and mixed oxide unoxidized ore from the baltic pit of the rand mine 
rand mine the rand mine produced  ounces of gold in the year ended december  which was higher than the  ounces of gold in the year ended december  the annualized rate of production was  ounces of gold during the six months ended december  this significant improvement in production was the direct result of mining oxide ore from the yellow aster pit of the rand mine and the first full year of operations with the new mining equipment purchased in the move to larger equipment was designed to maximise productivity over life of mine 
due to lower gold prices and the associated decrease in proven and probable reserves as at december   of  ounces inclusive of  ounces that were mined and stacked on the heap leach pads  the company revised the mine plan which resulted in a reduction inthe number of mining shifts during the st quarter of picacho mine the picacho mine produced  ounces of gold during the year ended december  which is only lower than the  ounces of gold produced during the year ended december  the production increase of over the annualized rate of  ounces of gold produced during the six months ended december  was the result of focused water management and the tonnage mined during the year being mainly ore 
mining of the last known ore body at the picacho mine was completed in december  on target with life of mine projections 
gold production will continue for two years followed by reclamation of the last remaining heap leach pad and processing facility 
reclamation is expected to be completed by the year  with continued revegetation monitoring thereafter 
revenue revenue for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of 
with the average revenue realized per ounce of gold being for and in the year ended december   revenue decreased million due to the changes in the price of gold 
the increase in production for the year ended december  increased revenue realized during by million over the production rate during the year ended december  revenue for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the six months ended december   an increase of on an annualized basis 
with the average revenue realized per ounce of gold being for and in the six months ended december   revenue increased million due to the changes in the price of gold 
the increase in production for the year ended december  increased revenue realized during by million over the annualized rate for the six months ended december  revenue for the six months ended december  was a decrease on an annualized basis compared to the million for the fiscal year ended june  revenue decreased mainly because of the decrease in production at the rand mine 
cost of production the cost of production includes mining  processing and direct mine overhead costs while royalties  selling  general and administrative costs and depreciation and depletion costs are excluded 
cost of production of million for the year ended december  was greater than the million incurred for the year ended december  an increase of approximately million resulted from an increase in production of  ounces of gold 
a write down of approximately million ofthe carrying value of work in process inventories on the company s books at the picacho and rand mines was due to a reduction in the ounces of gold on the heap leach pads expected to be recoveredat lower gold prices 
the cash cost per ounce of gold production increased during the year ended december  to per ounce of gold from per ounce of gold for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to inventory cost adjustments described above 
the company s cost of production of million for the year ended december  is greater  on an annualized basis  than the million incurred for the six months ended december  this increase during was due to an increase in production on an annualized basis of  ounces of gold at the picacho mine and of  ounces of gold at the rand mine 
for the six months ended december   the cost of production at million was a increase on an annualized basis over the million incurred in the fiscal year ended june  this annualized increase is primarily the result of a million write down of the work in process inventory on the heap leach pad at the baltic facilities caused by the lower recovery rates experienced from that heap during the period 
expenses for the year ended december   depreciation and depletion charges were million compared to the million incurred for the year ended december  the increase is principally attributable to the increase in gold production during depreciation and depletion charges on a per ounce basis at the picacho and rand mines during the fiscal year ending december   are expected to remain comparable to the year ended december  depreciation and depletion charges for the year ended december  were million compared to the million incurred for the six months ended december   an increase of on an annualized basis 
depletion was million greater than the prior period on an annualized basis because the production was higher in the period 
a million increase in depreciation during this period resulted from the acquisition of assets during which had been leased  and the higher level of production  causing more pad depreciation to be incurred 
depreciation and depletion charges for the six months ended december  increased on an annualized basis compared to such charges for the year ended june  this increase was a direct result of the reduction of the work in process inventory on the heap leach pad of the baltic facilities 
the reduction in the number of ounces recoverable from the heap increased the per ounce charges 
royalty expense of million increased less than million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the increase was caused by the increase in production at the rand mine 
for the year ended december   royalty expense increased or million as compared to the six months ended december  on an annualized basis 
this was caused by the increase in production and the higher royalty rates incurred on the ounces of gold produced at the picacho and rand mines 
royalty expense was down by  on an annualized basis  for the six months ended december  compared to the year ended june   due to decreased production from the baltic pit 
the company incurred million for exploration expenses in the year ended december   of which approximately is attributable to the indonesian project and approximately million relates toexploration and evaluation expenditures on the mina prospect in nevada 
this figure compares favourably to the million incurred in the year ended december  the projects were abandoned because they did not meet the company s investment criteria 
the exploration budget is estimated at million for continued exploration at the rand mine 
exploration expenses of million for the year ended december  were the write off of exploration costs on the jojoba prospect in mexico 
the company expended an additional million dollars on the evaluation of several other properties during the year in an effort to acquire additional reserves for the company 
exploration expense for the six months ended december  was minimal 
the decrease during the period as compared to the prior year reflects the decision to suspend grass roots exploration during the period 
the company incurred a major exploration expense in fiscal year for the due diligence on the primary mining property held by golden queen mining co 
ltd 
as part of a proposed acquisition of golden queen by the company 
the acquisition was not completed because the merger proved to be uneconomic for the company 
for the year ended december   general and administrative costs of million were greater than the million incurred for the year ended december  the general and administrative expenses for the year ending december  are expected to decrease by an estimated compared with those incurred in the fiscal year as the result of restructuring activities  which are expected to have little effect on the company s operations 
in the first quarter of  restructuring activities included the reduction of the total number of employees by which includes layoffs at picacho mine due to the mine closure  a reduction in the number of mining shifts at rand mine due to the changes in the mine plan and the transfer of the management functions from the vancouver office to the reno office to reduce general and administrative costs 
general and administrative costs of million for the year ended december  were greater on an annualized basis than the million incurred for the six months ended december  the major expense impacting the increase in costs during the year was approximately  related to the unsuccessful equity financing activities during june and july  on an annualized basis there was no material change in general and administrative costs for the six months ended december  compared to the fiscal year ended june  during the year ended december   the company wrote down the carrying value of investments in two junior exploration companies by million 
in addition  the carrying value of the cieneguita joint venture was reduced by approximately million because of the lower price of gold 
during the current year  a restructuring cost of million was accrued for severance and closure costs of the vancouver officeand severance and relocation costs at the reno office 
other income and expenses for the year ended december  interest and other income of million resulted from interest income on the cash balances of the company 
interest and other income at million for the year ended december  includes a gain of approximately  from the sale of the investment in aquiline resources 
the loss of million for the six months ended december  includes a charge of  for the loss on the sale of the investment and costs when the bid to acquire eldorado corporation was allowed to lapse during the period 
interest and amortization of deferred financing costsfor the year ended december  decreased almost million as compared to the year ended december  because the standby fees on the company s credit facility were suspended for the year since there was no borrowing available under the facility 
these items for the year ended december   the six months ended december   on an annualized basis  and for the year ended june  are comparable 
the net loss for the year ended december  was million per share compared to earnings for the year ended december  of million per share and the net loss for the six months ended december  of million per share 
net income for the year ended june  was million per share 
liquidity and capital resources the company had working capital of million at december  compared to million at december   and million at december  the long term liabilities consisting of reserves for reclamation and deferred taxes totalled approximately million at december  compared to million at december   and june   respectively 
included in the working capital was cash of million at december   million at december   and million at december  during the current year cashflow from operations totalled million compared to million for the year ended december   while the six months ended december  resulted in cash used in operations of  a positive cashflow from operations of million occurred in the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in cash flow during the year ended december  is the result of the decrease in the revenue realised per ounce of gold 
during the year ended december   the company sold  common shares by public offering in canada to produce net proceeds to the company of approximately  no dividends will be declared or paid in due to the loss 
a dividend of per share was paid on march  to shareholders of record at march  no dividends were declared or paid during the year ended december  a dividend of cdn

at the present time no credit is available to the company 
management is continuing its dialogue with the lending institution and is also considering new sources of financing 
the lending institution has continued to sustain the company by leaving in place million of letters of credit issued as security for future reclamation costs 
the company has an arrangement with a bonding company which has replaced letters of credit in the amount of million with bonds issued as security for future reclamation costs 
assuming an average gold price of and estimated production of  ounces  the anticipated cashflow from operations for the year ending december  is estimated to be million  thus with cash on hand of million and no debt outstanding other than current liabilities as at december   management believes that the company has sufficient resources to proceed with growth and capital projects 
capital expenditures during the year ended december   a total of million was expended on capital projects and investments as compared to the million expended in the year ended december  major expenditures during the fiscal year were as follows millions drilling  exploration and claims acquistion at rand mine purchase of used shovel at rand mine deposits on equipment purchases for the imperial project imperial project planning  permitting  and development other the company s capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended december  are estimated to be million 
the major expenditures will be million for permitting at the imperial project and million for construction of a leach pad extension at the rand mine 
the company paid deposits totalling million during and of the total cost of million for the acquisition of a shovel for the imperial project which is stored at the supplier s site 
major capital expenditures for the imperial project have been postponed until all permits are received and the price of gold improves 
management is now seeking a suitable buyer for the shovel but does not intend to sell the equipment at a loss 
hedging during the third quarter of  the company implemented a limited policy to hedge future gold production and pursuant to this the company acquired put options 
as at december   the company had purchased put options for  ounces of gold at per ounce expiring through april on february   the company amended its policy to enable future hedging as needed  of up to of planned production for up to five years 
break even price per ounce of gold a major external factor that has had and will continue to havea marked effect on liquidity  either positive or negative  is the price of gold bullion on international markets 
the company s break even price per ounce of gold for the year ending december  is estimated to be compared to the year ended december  actual of  in the year ended december   and the break even price of  on an annualized basis  for the six months ended december   and for the fiscal year ended june  the break even price of gold includes all costs  including depreciation and depletion  royalties  corporate administration and exploration but excludes inventoryand investment write downs and one time costs associated with the corporate restructuring 
depreciation and depletion is projected to be per ounce of gold for the year ending december  compared to per ounce of gold for the year ending december   per ounce of gold for the year ending december    on an annualized basis  for the six months ended december   and for the fiscal year ended june  on a purely cash basis  the break even price per ounce of gold is projected to be for the fiscal year ending december   which compares very favourably to the actual of per ounce of gold for the year ended december  and per ounce of gold for the fiscal years ended december   and june  any sustained changes in the price of gold over or under these levels will appreciably affect the company s general liquidity position  and could substantially increase or decrease revenues  earnings and cashflow as the case may be 
regulatory  environmental and other risk factors reclamation the company generally is required to mitigate long term environmental impacts by stabilizing  contouring  reshaping and revegetating various portions of a site once mining and processing are completed 
reclamation efforts are conducted in accordance with detailed plans which have been reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies 
whenever feasible  reclamation is conducted concurrently with mining 
during the past three years  reclamation expenditures have not been material 
standard open pit leaching techniques have been established to meet reclamation requirements imposed by regulatory authorities 
due to the impervious qualities of the heap leach pad and the closed nature of the leaching system  the company believes that its mining operations have a relatively modest effect on the environment 
though the company believes that its mining operations are in compliance with all present health  safety and environmental rules and regulations there is always some uncertainty associated with such due to the complexity and application of such rules and regulations 
the company does not anticipate that the cost of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations will have a material impact on its earnings in the foreseeable future 
however  possible future health  safety and environmental legislation  regulations and actions could cause additional expense  capital expenditures  restrictions and delays in the activities of the company  the extent of which cannot be predicted 
the company made no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities  other than for design of monitoring systems at the picacho and rand mines  during the years ended december  and december   the six months ended december  and the fiscal year ended june  and estimates that it will make no material capital expenditures in this area during the fiscal year ending december   other than monitoring systems incorporated in leach pad construction and expansion programs 
at the corporate level  an environmental compliance committee and policy statement were established to assure measurable standards for internal environmental audits for review by the board of directors 
the committee has been active and is satisfied the company is complying with regulatory parameters 
legislation has been introduced in prior sessions of the us congress to make significant revisions to the us general mining law of which would affect the company s unpatented mining claims on federal lands  including a royalty on gold production 
any levy of the type proposed in the past would only apply to unpatented federal lands and accordingly would have an insignificant effect on the economics of the picacho mine and rand mine s production from the yellow aster pit 
it cannot be predicted if these proposals will become law 
however  should a royalty become law  it will affect the profitability of rand s production from the baltic and lamont pits and the profitability of the imperial project 
a net profits royalty of to the us government  which may or may not be an adequate allowance  was included in the final feasibility study for the imperial project and is included in the estimated total cost of production per ounce of for the project 
the company s mineral development and mining activities and profitability involve significant risks due to numerous factors outside of its control  including the price of gold  risks inherent in mining  foreign exchange fluctuations and the above described regulatory matters 
year the company has been actively reviewing all of the computer systems currently in use from the computer control module in its haul trucks  loaders  shovels  and drills to those used for financial and cost accounting as well as those used for mine planning 
the review has not yet identified any systems which will be affected by the year risks 
the company feels that any problems identified  if any  as this review is completed in the coming year will not require significant resources to correct
