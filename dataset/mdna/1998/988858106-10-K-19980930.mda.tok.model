year the company s management has recognized the need to ensure that its operations and relationships with vendors and other third parties will not be adversely impacted by software processing errors arising from calculations using the year and beyond year 
like those of many companies  a significant number of zale s computer applications and systems require modification over the next year in order to render these systems year compliant 
the company recognizes that failure by the company to timely resolve internal year issues could result  in the worst case  in an inability of the company to distribute its merchandise to its stores and to process its daily business for some period of time 
however  company management presently believes that scenario is unlikely based on the progress made in its year remediation plan 
failure of one or more third party service providers on whom the company relies to address year issues could also result  in a worst case scenario  in some business interruption 
the lost revenues  if any  resulting from a worst case scenario such as those examples described above would depend on the time period in which the failure goes uncorrected and on how widespread the impact 
zale is using a combination of internal and external resources to assess and make the needed changes to its many different information technology it systems and personal computers  such as credit  point of sale  payroll  purchase ordering  merchandise distribution  management reporting  mainframe  and client server applications 
a formal project began in to inventory all the specialized software programs and hardware used in the company s business 
the inventory is substantially complete and renovation is currently underway 
non compliant programs and systems are being replaced  modified or outsourced throughout and early testing has begun and will be substantially complete by july  the company has communicated  and will continue to communicate  with its suppliers  financial institutions and others with which it does business to monitor and evaluate year conversion progress 
progress reports on the year project are presented regularly to the company s board of directors and senior management 
with regard to non it systems  such as the general office security systems  store security systems  environmental systems  and phone systems  the company is currently evaluating the compliance of such systems 
systems that are not compliant  if any  will be remediated  upgraded or replaced by july  beginning in june  the company sent approximately  inquiries to its vendors requesting compliance certification 
the company is presently collecting responses to those inquiries  focusing first on the most critical vendors 
the company outsources or will outsource its mis processing and credit processing and inquiry 
these outsourcers have contractually committed to year compliance and are diligently pursuing that commitment 
the company s primary delivery service provider stated that its goal is to be year compliant by may  the company s payroll processing service provider has indicated that its major systems will operate with correct date logic for year direct expenditures were approximately million and internal costs were approximately million  for a total cost of million in expenditures associated with the year in fiscal year direct costs of million and internal costs of million  for a total cost of million  are expected in fiscal year the company will fund these expenditures through its normal it operations budget 
as required by generally accepted accounting principles  these costs are expensed as incurred 
the company has had each of its departments or divisions develop basic contingency plans to restore the material functions of each of its systems or activities in the case of a year failure 
the contingency plans cover all material levels of activity within each business location  including the stores  the general office  the credit centers and third party service providers 
the company plans to continually refine these plans and make them more comprehensive as more information becomes available from testing and from third party suppliers 
in addition  the company s two processing outsourcers also have contingency plans for the company s processing should their primary systems fail 
additionally  in the normal course of business  the company has made capital investments in certain third party software and hardware systems to address the financial and operational needs of the business 
these systems  which will improve the efficiencies and productivity of the replaced systems  have also been certified year compliant by the vendors and have been or will be installed by july  to date all of these capital projects were part of the company s long term strategic capital plan and their timing was not accelerated as a result of the year issue 
although there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete all of the modifications in the required time frame  that unanticipated events will not occur  or that the company will be able to identify all year issues before problems manifest themselves  it is management s belief that the company is taking adequate action to address year issues 
management does not expect the financial impact of being year compliant to be material to the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
inflation in management s opinion  changes in net sales and net earnings that have resulted from inflation and changing prices have not been material during the periods presented 
there is no assurance  however  that inflation will not materially affect the company in the future
