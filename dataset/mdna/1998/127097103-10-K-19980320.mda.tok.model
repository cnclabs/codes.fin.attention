the proved reserve estimates presented herein were prepared by the company s petroleum engineering staff and reviewed by miller and lents  ltd  independent petroleum engineers 
for additional information regarding the company s estimates of proved reserves  the review of such estimates by miller and lents  ltd 
and certain other information regarding the company s oil and gas reserves  see the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item hereof 
a copy of the review letter by miller and lents  ltd  has been filed as an exhibit to this form k 
the company s estimates of proved reserves set forth in the foregoing table do not differ materially from those filed by the company with other federal agencies 
the company s reserves are sensitive to natural gas sales prices and their effect on economic producing rates 
the company s reserves are based on oil and gas prices in effect at december  there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves  including many factors beyond the control of the company and  therefore  the reserve information set forth in this form k represents only estimates 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner  and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
as a result  estimates of different engineers often vary 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimate 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
the meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based 
in general  the volume of production from oil and gas properties owned by the company declines as reserves are depleted 
except to the extent the company acquires additional properties containing proved reserves or conducts successful exploration and development activities or both  the proved reserves of the company will decline as reserves are produced

competition competition in the company s primary producing areas is intense 
the company believes that its competitive position is affected by price  contract terms and quality of service  including pipeline connection times  distribution efficiencies and reliable delivery record 
the company believes that its extensive acreage position and existing natural gas gathering and pipeline systems and storage fields give it a competitive advantage over certain other producers in the appalachian region which do not have such systems or facilities in place 
the company also believes that its competitive position in the appalachian region is enhanced by the absence of significant competition from major oil and gas companies 
the company also actively competes against some companies with substantially larger financial and other resources  particularly in the western region 
the company also believes that its competitive position is enhanced by marketing its own gas through the operation of cabot oil gas marketing corporation 
other business matters major customer the company had no sales to any customer that exceeded of the company s total gross revenues in seasonality demand for natural gas has historically been seasonal in nature  with peak demand and typically higher prices occurring during the colder winter months 
regulation of oil and natural gas production the company s oil and gas production and transportation operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal  state and local authorities 
the statutory law affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion 
further  numerous departments and agencies  federal  state and local  have issued rules and regulations affecting the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members  compliance with which is often difficult and costly and some of which may carry substantial penalties for non compliance 
the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases its cost of doing business and  consequently  affects its profitability 
inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently expanded  amended or reinterpreted  the company is unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such regulations 
however  the company does not believe that under present regulations it is affected in a significantly different manner by these regulations than others in the industry 
exploration and production the exploration and production operations of the company are subject to various types of regulation at the federal  state and local levels 
such regulation includes requiring permits for the drilling of wells  maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells  and regulating the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandoning of wells 
the company s operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations 
these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the density of wells which may be drilled in a given field and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties 
in this regard  some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases 
in addition  state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells  generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability of production 
in this regard  such states as texas  oklahoma and louisiana have in recent years reviewed and substantially revised the methodologies previously used by them to gather the necessary information and make monthly determinations of appropriate field and well production allowables 
the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas the company can produce from its wells  and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which the company can drill 
natural gas marketing  gathering and transportation federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the price of the natural gas produced by the company and the manner in which such production is transported and marketed 
under the natural gas act of  the federal energy regulatory commission the ferc regulates the interstate transportation and the sale in interstate commerce for resale of natural gas 
the ferc s jurisdiction over interstate sales of natural gas was substantially modified by the natural gas policy act  under which the ferc continued to regulate the maximum selling prices of certain categories of gas sold in first sales in interstate and intrastate commerce 
effective january   however  the natural gas wellhead decontrol act the decontrol act deregulated natural gas prices for all first sales of natural gas  which includes all sales by the company of its own production 
as a result  all of the company s domestically produced natural gas may now be sold at market prices  subject to the terms of any private contracts which may be in effect 
the ferc s jurisdiction over natural gas transportation was unaffected by the decontrol act 
the company s natural gas sales are affected by the regulation of intrastate and interstate gas transportation 
in an attempt to restructure the interstate pipeline industry with the goal of providing enhanced access to  and competition among  alternative natural gas suppliers  the ferc  commencing in april  issued order nos 
 a and b order no 
which have altered significantly the interstate transportation and sale of natural gas 
previously  the interstate pipelines had acted primarily as wholesalers of natural gas  purchasing the gas from producers in or within the vicinity of the production areas and reselling the gas to large industrial customers and local distribution companies 
among other things  order no 
required interstate pipelines to unbundle their wholesale merchant services into the various constituent services  such as sales  transmission and storage  and to offer these unbundled services individually to their customers 
by requiring interstate pipelines to unbundle their services and to provide their customers with direct access to pipeline capacity  order no 
enabled pipeline customers to choose the levels of transportation and storage service they require  as well as to purchase natural gas directly from third party merchants other than the interstate pipelines and obtain transportation of such gas on a nondiscriminatory basis 
through similar orders pertaining to intrastate pipelines which provide certain interstate services  the ferc has expanded the impact of these so called open access regulations to intrastate commerce 
the effect of order no 
and related orders has been to enable the company to market its natural gas production to a wider variety of potential purchasers 
the company believes that these changes generally have improved the company s access to transportation and have enhanced the marketability of its natural gas production 
to date  order no 
has not had any material adverse effect on the company s ability to market and transport its natural gas production 
however  even though order no 
has been affirmed on appeal  with minor exceptions  and individual interstate pipelines have had final open access tariffs in place for several years  the ferc is continuing to review  assess and modify its transportation regulations and the company cannot predict what new or different regulations may be adopted by the ferc and other regulatory authorities  or what effect subsequent regulations may have on the company s activities 
in recent years the ferc also has pursued a number of other important policy initiatives which have significantly affected the marketing of natural gas 
some of the more notable of these regulatory initiatives have included i a series of orders in individual pipeline proceedings articulating a policy of generally approving the voluntary divestiture of interstate pipeline owned gathering facilities either to non affiliated companies a spin off or to the pipeline s nonregulated affiliate a spin down  ii the completion of a rulemaking proceeding involving the regulation of pipelines with marketing affiliates under order no 
 iii ferc s ongoing efforts to promulgate standards for pipeline electronic bulletin boards and electronic data exchange  iv a generic inquiry into the pricing of interstate pipeline capacity  v efforts to refine ferc s regulations controlling the operation of the secondary market for released pipeline capacity  vi a policy statement and a series of orders in individual pipeline dockets regarding market based rates and other non cost based rates for interstate pipeline transmission and storage capacity and vii appropriate ratemaking procedures for pipeline expansions and extensions 
several of these initiatives are intended to enhance competition in natural gas markets  although some  such as the so called spin down of previously regulated gathering facilities by interstate pipelines to their affiliates  may have the adverse effect on some in the industry of increasing the cost of doing business as a result of the potential for monopolization of those facilities by their new  unregulated owners 
ferc attempted to address some of these concerns in its orders authorizing such spin downs  but one of its principal devices  the use of default contracts to assure continuity of gathering services for two years after spin down  was found unlawful on appeal 
it remains to be seen what effect the ferc s other activities will have on access to markets and the cost to do business 
in response to the ferc s policy of authorizing the interstate pipeline industry s divestiture of these gathering facilities  several states most notably oklahoma and texas enacted or are considering laws and regulations enhancing state level oversight over gathering 
as to all of these recent ferc and state initiatives  the ongoing  or  in some instances  preliminary evolving nature of these regulatory initiatives makes it impossible to predict their ultimate impact upon the company s activities 
the company s pipeline systems and storage fields are regulated for safety compliance by the us department of transportation  the west virginia public service commission  the pennsylvania department of natural resources and the new york department of public service 
the company s pipeline systems in each state operate independently and are not interconnected 
environmental regulations general 
the company s operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation  storage  handling  emission  transportation and discharge of materials into the environment 
permits are required for the operation of various facilities of the company  and these permits are subject to revocation  modification and renewal by issuing authorities 
governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations  and violations are subject to fines  injunctions or both 
such government regulation can increase the cost of planning  designing  installing and operating oil and gas facilities 
in most instances  the regulatory requirements impose water and air pollution control measures 
although the company believes that compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on the company  risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are inherent in oil and gas production operations  and no assurance can be given that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred 
moreover  it is possible that other developments  such as stricter environmental laws and regulations  and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from oil and gas production would result in substantial costs and liabilities to the company 
solid and hazardous waste 
the company currently owns or leases  and has in the past owned or leased  numerous properties that have been used for production of oil and gas for many years 
although the company has utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  hydrocarbons or other solid wastes may have been disposed or released on or under the properties owned or leased by the company 
in addition  many of the properties have been operated by third parties 
the company had no control over such parties treatment of hydrocarbons or other solid wastes and the manner in which such substances may have been disposed or released 
state and federal laws applicable to oil and gas wastes and properties have gradually become stricter over time 
under these new laws  the company could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed or released by prior owners and operators or property contamination including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators or to perform remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination 
the company generates some wastes that are subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes 
the environmental protection agency epa has limited the disposal options for certain hazardous wastes 
furthermore  it is possible that certain wastes currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes under rcra or other applicable statues  and therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements 
superfund 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla  also known as the superfund law  imposes liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons with respect to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the owner and operator of a site and any party that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance found at a site 
cercla also authorizes the epa  and in some cases  third parties  to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible parties the costs of such action 
in the course of the company s operations  the company has generated and will generate wastes that may fall within cercla s definition of hazardous substances 
the company may also be an owner of sites on which hazardous substances have been released 
therefore  the company may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which such wastes have been disposed 
oil pollution act 
the oil pollution act of the opa and regulations thereunder impose a variety of regulations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the united states 
the term waters of the united states has been broadly defined to include inland waste bodies  including wetlands and intermittent streams 
the opa assigns liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages 
air emissions 
the operations of the company are subject to local  state and federal laws and regulations for the control of emissions from sources of air pollution 
administrative enforcement actions for failure to comply strictly with air regulations or permits are generally resolved by payment of monetary fines and correction of any identified deficiencies 
alternatively  regulatory agencies could require the company to cease construction or operation of certain air emission sources 
the company believes that it is in substantial compliance with the emission standards under local  state and federal laws and regulations 
employees the company had active employees as of december  the company believes that its relations with its employees are satisfactory 
the company has not entered into any collective bargaining agreements with its employees 
other the company s profitability depends on certain factors that are beyond its control  such as natural gas and crude oil prices 
the nature of the oil and gas business involves a variety of risks  including the risk of experiencing certain operating hazards such as fires  explosions  blowouts  cratering  oil spills and encountering formations with abnormal pressures  the occurrence of any of which could result in substantial losses to the company 
the operation of the company s natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves certain risks  including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures 
the proximity of pipelines to populated areas  including residential areas  commercial business centers and industrial sites  could exacerbate such risks 
at december   the company owned or operated approximately  miles of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems 
as part of its normal maintenance program  the company has identified certain segments of its pipelines which it believes require repair  replacement or additional maintenance 
in accordance with customary industry practices  the company maintains insurance against some  but not all  of such risks 
item properties see item business 
item legal proceedings the company and its subsidiaries are defendants or parties in numerous lawsuits or other governmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
the company is also involved in other gas contract issues 
in the opinion of the company  final judgments or settlements  if any  which may be awarded in connection with any one or more of these suits and claims could be significant to the results of operations and cash flows of any period but would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position 
on february   washington energy company and puget sound power light company merged to form puget sound energy  inc puget 
as a result of the merger  puget is the holder of  shares of common stock and  shares of the company s convertible redeemable preferred stock convertible into  shares of common stock  all of which were previously held by washington energy company 
mr 
william p 
vititoe  a member of the company s board of directors  is a consultant to puget and was formerly an officer and director of washington energy company 
the company sells approximately  mmbtu of natural gas per day in the western region to a cogeneration plant located in bellingham  washington and owned by encogen northwest  lp encogen under a gas sales contract containing a fixed price that escalates annually  a firm delivery arrangement and a term continuing through june  encogen sells all the electrical power generated in the plant to puget under an agreement for firm power purchase power agreement 
the company is aware that a dispute has arisen between puget and encogen over the appropriate interpretation of certain provisions of the power agreement  which dispute is currently being litigated 
puget has requested the court  among other matters  to declare that encogen is in material breach of the power agreement 
a finding by the court that encogen is in material breach of the power agreement could lead to termination of the power agreement 
any restructuring or termination of the power agreement may have a negative impact on the company s gas sales arrangement with encogen 
encogen has requested that the company consider restructuring its gas sales arrangement with encogen 
to date the company has been unwilling to restructure its gas sales agreement without being fully compensated for the agreement s value

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following review of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere 
overview the initial upswing in gas prices early in the year  coupled with a increase in natural gas production  played an important part in the company s performance in with record earnings and operating cash flows 
operating results for included the benefit of the following o the average produced natural gas price was per mcf  up compared to  while equivalent production was up bcfe  or  compared to o under its continued asset rationalization program  involving the divestiture of non strategic properties  and synergistic growth through new acquisitions  the company completed a like kind exchange transaction in october which matched properties purchased  including wells and potential drilling locations  in the green river basin of wyoming with a portion of the properties divested in the meadville district of the appalachian region  including wells and related assets 
this transaction generated net proceeds of million 
o net interest costs were down million  or  excluding the benefit of the non recurring million of interest income received in that related to an income tax refund for tax periods prior to this reduction in interest cost was a result of debt reductions made possible by strong operating cash flow in o depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expenses were down million or per mcfe of production 
this improvement was primarily the result of the reduction in high cost depreciable assets due to the disposition of the meadville properties in september operating cash flows reached a record level of million  increasing million  or  from cash flows from operations  along with the million of net proceeds from the meadville green river property transaction noted above  predominantly funded million of capital and exploration expenditures  excluding the green river property acquisition million higher than  million of net debt reductions and million of preferred and common stock dividend payments 
the company drilled net wells with a net success rate of compared to net wells and a net success rate in along with the higher success rate in  the company replaced of production through drilling additions and revisions  versus a production replacement in in the company plans to drill gross wells net and spend million in capital and exploration expenditures  higher than expenditures 
natural gas production equivalent was bcf  an increase of over the production growth resulted from the company s expanded drilling programs in and additionally  the underperforming properties sold in the meadville district  effective september   which would have produced an estimated bcfe in the remaining four months of  were more than offset by the acquired green river properties which added bcfe to production 
the company s strategic pursuits are sensitive to energy commodity prices  particularly the price of natural gas 
gas prices rose to near record levels in november and december although prices rose still further in january  the gas market demonstrated significant price volatility in the spring months 
prices in most regions rose sharply in october and november  but due to the unseasonably warm winter  softened in december and january to levels significantly below the prices realized in the corresponding months of the prior year 
the company remains focused on its strategies to grow through the drill bit  through synergistic acquisitions and through greater emphasis on marketing 
the company believes that these strategies are appropriate in the current industry environment and establish a firm base which will enable the company to create shareholder value over the long term 
the success of these strategies is measured by the achievement of three goals 
the first of these goals is to increase cash flow from both increased production and reduced costs 
the company has made significant progress in this area 
during  production increased while direct operating cost per mcfe declined  contributing to the increase in operational cash flow 
the second goal is to maintain reserves per share while increasing production to protect long term shareholder value 
reserve additions from the drilling program replaced of production 
in total  reserve levels decreased slightly due to actions taken as part of the asset rationalization program 
the company plans to drill gross wells in and increase exploratory drilling  lease acquisition and geophysical expenditures 
finally  the company strives to reduce debt as a percentage of total capitalization without diluting shareholder value 
this ratio was at the end of and has improved to in due mainly to a million reduction in total borrowings  made possible from the net proceeds generated from the sale of the meadville properties 
in october  the company exercised the option to convert all of the cumulative preferred stock into approximately  shares of common stock 
by eliminating the dividends on the cumulative preferred shares  an additional million of annual earnings will be made available to common shareholders in future years 
the preceding paragraphs  discussing the company s strategic pursuits and goals  contain forward looking information 
see forward looking information on page financial condition capital resources and liquidity the company s capital resources consist primarily of cash flows from its oil and gas properties and asset based borrowing supported by its oil and gas reserves 
the company s level of earnings and cash flows depend on many factors  including the price of oil and natural gas and its ability to control and reduce costs 
demand for oil and gas has historically been subject to seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season 
natural gas prices were up in over  resulting in higher cash flows 
the primary sources of cash for the company during were from funds generated from operations and net cash proceeds from the sale of the meadville properties and acquisition of the green river properties 
primary uses of cash were funds used in operations  exploration and development expenditures  acquisitions  dividends on preferred and common stock and repayment of debt 
the company had a net cash inflow of million in net cash inflow from operating and financing activities totaled million  funding the capital and exploration expenditures of million  net of the million in net proceeds from the sale of assets 
in millions cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities in were substantially higher  increasing million over  due primarily to higher natural gas prices and production  and a significant reduction in trade receivables 
cash flows provided by operating activities in were higher by million compared with due predominantly to higher natural gas prices 
in millions cash flows used by investing activities cash flows used by investing activities in were million lower than in due to net proceeds of million received from the meadville green river property transaction  partially offset by the expenses of the stronger drilling program 
cash flows used by investing activities in were million higher than in due primarily to million of increased capital and exploration expenditures over the company s drilling program was scaled down  drilling only net wells  compared to an average of net wells per year over the previous five years 
the capital expenditures were offset in part by proceeds of million from the sale of assets 
in millions cash flows used by financing activities cash flows used by financing activities from consist primarily of the million net reduction in borrowings on the revolving credit facility as well as dividend payments 
the activity was mostly attributable to dividend payments  but also included a reduction in debt under the credit facility 
cash flows used by financing activities from were primarily net payments on the company s revolving credit facility  reducing the debt under this facility by million 
the company s available credit line under the revolving credit facility was million from june until november in november  the company issued million in notes see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion and reduced the available credit line to million 
the available credit line is subject to adjustment on the basis of the projected present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves as determined by an independent petroleum engineer s report incorporating certain assumptions provided by the lender and other assets 
the company s outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility was million at december  the company s interest expense is projected to be approximately million 
a principal payment of million on the private placement of senior notes is due in the second quarter of the company has begun making necessary changes to its computer software in preparation for the year these projects are on schedule and the company believes that the related costs will not be material to its results of operations or financial condition

the company s average produced natural gas sales price increased compared to  while production volumes increased 
as a result  the company experienced its highest level of earnings and operating cash flow since becoming a public company in while prices in most regions of the us moved up sharply in november and december and january  price volatility in the gas market has remained prevalent in the last few years  as demonstrated most recently in december and january  with natural gas prices dropping to levels substantially below the prices of the corresponding months of the prior year 
given this continued price volatility  management cannot predict with certainty what pricing levels will be for the rest of and beyond 
because future cash flows and earnings are subject to such variables  there can be no assurance that the company s operations will provide cash sufficient to fully fund its capital requirements if prices should return to the depressed levels of while the company s plans include an increase in capital spending  the company will periodically assess industry conditions and will adjust its spending plan to ensure the adequate funding of its capital requirements  including  among other things  reductions in capital expenditures or common stock dividends 
the company believes its capital resources  supplemented  if necessary  with external financing  are adequate to meet its capital requirements
