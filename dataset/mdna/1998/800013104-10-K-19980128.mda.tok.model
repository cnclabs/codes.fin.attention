general the company s poultry operations are integrated through its control of all functions relative to the production of its chicken products  including hatching egg production  hatching  feed manufacturing  raising chickens to marketable age grow out  processing and marketing 
consistent with the poultry industry  the company s profitability is substantially impacted by the market price for its finished products and feed grains  both of which may fluctuate substantially and exhibit cyclical characteristics typically associated with commodity markets 
other costs  excluding feed grains  related to the profitability of the company s poultry operations  including hatching egg production  hatching  growing  and processing cost  are responsive to efficient cost containment programs and management practices 
over the past three fiscal years  these other production costs have averaged approximately of the company s total production costs 
the company believes that value added products are subject to less price volatility and generate higher  more consistent profit margin than whole chickens ice packed and shipped in bulk form 
to reduce its exposure to market cyclicality that has historically characterized commodity chicken market prices  the company has increasingly concentrated on the production and marketing of value added product lines with emphasis on product quality  customer service  and brand recognition 
the company adds value to its poultry products by performing one or more processing steps beyond the stage where the whole chicken is first saleable as a finished product  such as cutting  deep chilling  packaging and labeling the product 
the company believes that one of its major strengths is its ability to change its product mix to meet customer demands 
the company s processed and prepared foods product line includes over institutional and consumer packaged food items that it sells nationally and regionally  primarily to distributors  food service establishments and retailers 
a majority of the prepared food items are made to the specifications of food service users

year high low although market prices for poultry products were higher during fiscal as compared to fiscal  the costs of feed grains were significantly higher and reduced margins 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company experienced improved selling prices of chicken products and lower average cost of feed grains 
however  later during fiscal  lower market prices for poultry products  the adverse effect of a change in the company s feed formulation  and additional costs associated with the start up of the new complex in texas partially offset the favorable market prices for poultry products during the first quarter of fiscal and the overall lower average feed costs during fiscal the company looks ahead to fiscal with caution 
the current market price for poultry  as measured by the georgia dock price  is approximately cents per pound lower than a year ago  while the cost of feed grains is roughly the same 
under these market conditions  the first quarter of fiscal will be difficult for sanderson farms 
although we are cautious in our outlook for the current quarter  we believe our operations are on tract to perform well when market conditions improve
