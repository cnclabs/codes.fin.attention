liquidity and capital resources the company funds its operations primarily through cash flow provided from operations 
as of december   the company had cash and cash equivalents totaling  and working capital of  in comparison  the company had cash and cash equivalents totaling  and working capital of  as of december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was due primarily to an increase in accounts receivable balances and inventories from year to year 
the company has received and anticipates it will continue to receive the majority of its cash from collections of accounts receivable from its distributors and oems 
these groups have a history of timely payments  however  an increasing amount of international sales can increase accounts receivable balances due to traditionally slower payments by international customers 
at december   net accounts receivable increased by  over s year end balance of  the increase was directly related to increased sales in and also slower payments of amounts due  particularly for international customers  than the company experienced in the company invests its excess cash in money market accounts and has established guidelines relative to diversification and maturities to maintain safety and liquidity 
these guidelines are periodically reviewed and modified to take advantage of trends in yields and interest rates 
the company has not experienced  to date  any losses on its short term investments 
during  the company invested cash in short term investments which generated interest income of inventory levels increased by  at december  from  at the end of this increase was primarily attributable to a general increase in the level of the company s business and also to increased inventories to support increased sales and to provide shorter lead times in filling customer orders

the line requires the company to maintain certain financial ratios 
 was outstanding under the line at december  the line expires on january  the company s overall level of operating expense is expected to increase due to increased expense associated with increased sales and also with the development and marketing of new products 
management believes that its existing cash  cash equivalents  cash generated from operations  and funds available under the bank line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy its currently anticipated working capital needs 
actual cash requirements may vary from planned amounts  depending on the timing of the launch and extent of acceptance of new products 
there can be no assurances that future cash requirements to fund operations will not require the company to seek additional capital  or that such additional capital will be available when required on terms acceptable to the company 
to date  inflation has not had a significant effect on the company s operating results 
the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the year approaches 
the year problem is pervasive and complex as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to the issue is whether computer systems will properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
the company s recent enterprise wide information system implementation  the initial phase of which is expected to be completed in  should mitigate most internal problems as the system vendors have represented that these systems are already year compliant 
in addition  the company is in the process of communicating with others with whom it does significant business to determine their year compliance readiness and the extent to which the company is vulnerable to any third party year issues 
management does not anticipate that the company will incur significant operating expenses or be required to invest heavily in other computer systems improvements to be year compliant 
the company plans to devote the necessary resources to resolve significant year issues in a timely manner  however  if the company  its customers  vendors or others with whom it does significant business are unable to resolve external processing issues in a timely manner  it could result in material adverse effect on certain of the company s operations
