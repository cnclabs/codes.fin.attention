item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview arqule is engaged in the discovery and development of novel chemical compounds with commercial potential in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agrochemical industries 
arqule manufactures and delivers two types of arrays of synthesized compounds to its pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agrochemical partners i mapping array compound sets  which are arrays of novel  diverse small molecule compounds used in screening for lead generation and ii directed array compound sets  which are arrays of analogs of a particular lead compound identified from a mapping array set or otherwise  synthesized for the purpose of optimizing such lead compounds 
the company currently generates revenue primarily through compound development from collaborative agreements  which provide for the development and delivery of mapping array and directed array sets 
the company s revenue to date is primarily attributable to seven major corporate collaborations amersham pharmacia biotech ab  entered into in march  abbott laboratories  entered into in june  solvay duphar bv  entered into in november  roche bioscience  entered into in september  monsanto company  entered into in december  american home products  entered into july  and sankyo ltd  entered into november under these collaborations  the company has received payments of million through december  and has recognized million as revenue 
the company recognizes revenue under its corporate collaborations as related work is performed and arrays are delivered 
payments received from corporate partners prior to the completion of the related work are recorded as deferred revenue 
license option fees are recognized as the options are granted because such fees are nonrefundable and the company has no further obligations to fulfill 
technology access fees are recognized over the length of the research and development agreement 
the company is also entitled to receive milestone and royalty payments if products generated under the collaborations are developed 
the company has not received any milestone or royalty payments to date 
the company has additionally entered into joint discovery agreements with a number of biotechnology companies to which it has provided mapping array and directed array sets in exchange for joint ownership interests of resulting drug candidates 
these agreements have not yet yielded any significant revenue for the company 
the company experienced its first year of profitability in  reflecting the increase in revenues resulting from arqule s growing collaborator base and an increase in interest income 
quarterly variations in future financial performance may be expected as increases in revenue are dependent on expanding existing collaborations  additional corporate collaborations  and future milestone payments  which may be inconsistent and difficult to anticipate 
in addition  the company will continue to aggressively invest in new technologies to expand its drug discovery capabilities 
the company also expects that strategic opportunities will arise to broaden the company s participation in drug discovery and to extend the company s proprietary technology platform to industry segments beyond pharmaceutical and agrochemical product discovery 
strategic investments of this nature have the potential for enhancing longer term equity value but may result in near term earnings fluctuations or impact profitability
