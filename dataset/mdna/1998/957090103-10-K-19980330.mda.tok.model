the following discussion addresses information pertaining to the financial condition and results of operations of westamerica bancorporation the company that may not be otherwise apparent from a review of the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
it should be read in conjunction with those statements and notes as well as with the other information presented throughout the report 
all financial information has been restated on a historical basis to reflect the vallicorp holdings  inc vallicorp acquisition on april  the merger using the pooling of interests method of accounting 
on january   the board of directors of the company authorized a three for one stock split of the company s common stock  effective february   in which each share of the company s common stock is converted into three shares 
consequently  all related information in this report has been restated to reflect the effect of the stock split 
the company achieved earnings of million in  representing a percent increase from the million earned in and percent higher than earnings of million 
components of net income in millions net interest income provision for loan losses non interest income non interest expense taxes net income net income as a percentage of average total assets fully taxable equivalent fte basic earnings per share in were  compared to and 
in and  respectively 
during  the company benefited from increased net interest income  primarily due to a decrease in short term borrowed funds in part offset by a reduction in the average balance of earning assets 
also contributing to increased earnings  the company lowered its loan loss provision in recognition of improved credit quality and lower net credit losses  and benefited from increased non interest income 
higher non interest expense included approximately million million after tax in charges associated with the merger 
earnings in were favorably affected compared to by increases in earning asset yields  a lower loan loss provision  higher non interest income and expense controls  which were partially offset by lower average balances of earning assets 
the company s return on average total assets was percent in  compared to percent and percent in and  respectively 
return on average equity in was percent  compared to percent and percent  respectively  in the two previous years 
net interest income the company s primary source of revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income fte in increased million from to million 
comparing to  net interest income fte decreased million 
components of net interest income in millions interest income interest expense fte adjustment net interest income fte average earning assets    net interest margin fte interest income fte decreased million from  primarily due to a million decrease in average earning asset balances 
categories of earning assets that decreased included most types of consumer loans  partially offset by increases in targeted commercial credits 
the average investment portfolio balances also decreased from  as reductions in short term funds sold  participation certificates and us treasury securities were in part offset by increases in tax free and us agency securities 
comparing to  interest income fte decreased million  principally due to a basis point decrease in earning asset yields in part offset by a million increase in average balances 
the revenue decrease in was more than offset by a million decrease in interest expense  the result of a decrease of basis points in rates paid on interest bearing liabilities combined with a million decrease in average balances  and a million increase in the average balance of non interest bearing demand deposits 
comparing to  the company experienced a million reduction in interest expense  primarily due to a million decrease in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities and a basis point decrease in the rates paid combined with an increase of million in the average balance of non interest bearing demand deposits 
in both periods  company has consistently been successful at reducing high rate time deposits while increasing the balances of more profitable  lower cost transaction accounts

investment portfolio the company maintains a securities portfolio consisting of us treasury  us government agencies and corporations  state and political subdivisions  asset backed and other securities 
investment securities are held in safekeeping by an independent custodian 
the objective of the investment securities held to maturity is to strengthen the portfolio yield  and to provide collateral to pledge for federal  state and local government deposits and other borrowing facilities 
the investments held to maturity had an average term to maturity of months at december  and  on the same date  those investments included million in fixed rate and thousand in adjustable rate securities 
investment securities available for sale are generally used to supplement the banks liquidity 
unrealized net gains and losses on these securities are recorded as an adjustment to equity  net of taxes  and are not reflected in the current earnings of the company 
if a security is sold  any gain or loss is recorded as a charge to earnings and the equity adjustment is reversed 
at december   the banks held  million classified as investments available for sale

asset quality the company closely monitors the markets in which it conducts its lending operations and continues its strategy to control exposure to loans with higher credit risk and increase diversification of earning assets 
asset reviews are performed using grading standards and criteria similar to those employed by bank regulatory agencies 
assets receiving lesser grades fall under the classified assets category  which includes all non performing assets and potential problem loans  and receive an elevated level of attention to ensure collection 
the following summarizes the company s classified assets for the periods indicated at december  in millions classified loans other classified assets total classified assets classified loans at december  increased million or percent to million from december   reflecting the implementation of the company s strict standards for loans acquired through the merger 
other classified assets decreased million from prior year  due to sales and write downs of properties acquired in satisfaction of debt other real estate owned partially offset by new foreclosures on loans with real estate collateral 
non performing assets non performing assets include non accrual loans  loans or more days past due and still accruing and other real estate owned 
loans are placed on non accrual status upon reaching days or more delinquent  unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
interest previously accrued on loans placed on non accrual status is charged against interest income 
in addition  some loans secured by real estate with temporarily impaired values and commercial loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties are placed on non accrual status even though the borrowers continue to repay the loans as scheduled 
such loans are classified by management as performing non accrual and are included in total non performing assets 
when the ability to fully collect non accrual loan principal is in doubt  cash payments received are applied against the principal balance of the loans until such time as full collection of the remaining recorded balance is expected 
any additional payments received after that point are recorded as interest income on a cash basis 
performing non accrual loans are reinstated to accrual status when improvements in credit quality eliminate the doubt as to the full collectibility of both interest and principal 
the following table summarizes the non performing assets of the company for the periods indicated december  in millions performing non accrual loans non performing non accrual loans non accrual loans restructured loans loans or more days past due and still accruing total non performing loans other real estate owned total non performing assets allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non performing loans allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total non performing assets performing non accrual loans decreased million to million at december  while non performing non accrual loans increased million to million at december   primarily due to the addition of commercial real estate loans partially offset by loan collections  write downs  payoffs and sales 
the million decrease in other real estate owned balances from december  was due to write downs and liquidations net of additions from non accrual loans on loans with real estate collateral 
the increase in other real estate owned balances at december  from december  was due to new foreclosures and transfers of loans with real estate collateral net of sales and write downs of properties acquired in satisfaction of debt 
the amount of gross interest income that would have been recorded for non accrual loans for the year ended december   if all such loans had been current in accordance with their original terms while outstanding during the period  was million in and and million in the amount of interest income that was recognized on non accrual loans from cash payments made in  and was thousand  thousand and thousand  respectively 
cash payments received  which were applied against the book balance of performing and non performing non accrual loans outstanding at december   totaled approximately thousand  compared to thousand and thousand in and  respectively 
the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio continues to be strong  however  the total non performing assets could fluctuate from year to year 
the performance of any individual loan can be impacted by external factors such as the interest rate environment or factors particular to the borrower 
the company expects to continue to reduce non performing assets  however  the company can give no assurance that additional increases in non accrual loans will not occur in future periods 
loan loss experience the company s allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level estimated to be adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated based upon specific conditions  credit loss experience  the amount of past due  non performing loans and classified loans  recommendations of regulatory authorities  prevailing economic conditions and other factors 
the allowance is allocated to segments of the loan portfolio based in part on quantitative analyses of historical credit loss experience  in which criticized and classified loan balances are analyzed using a linear regression model to determine standard allocation percentages 
the results of this analysis are applied to current criticized and classified loan balances to allocate the allowance to the respective segments of the loan portfolio 
in addition  loans with similar characteristics not usually criticized using regulatory guidelines due to their small balances and numerous accounts are analyzed based on the historical rate of net losses and delinquency trends grouped by the number of days the payments on those loans are delinquent 
a portion of the allowance is also allocated to impaired loans 
management considers the million allowance for loan losses  which constituted percent of total loans at december   to be adequate as a reserve against inherent losses 
however  while the company s policy is to charge off in the current period those loans on which the loss is considered probable  the risk exists of future losses which cannot be precisely quantified or attributed to particular loans or classes of loans 
management continues to evaluate the loan portfolio and assess current economic conditions that will dictate future allowance levels 
the following table summarizes the loan loss experience of the company for the periods indicated in thousands total loans outstanding      average loans outstanding during the period      analysis of the reserve beginning balance      additions to the reserve charged to operating expense      allowance acquired through merger    credit losses commercial and commercial real estate      real estate construction   real estate residential    consumer      total      credit loss recoveries commercial and commercial real estate      real estate construction real estate residential consumer      total      net credit losses      sale of sonoma valley bank balance  end of period      net credit losses to average loans allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans outstanding allocation of the allowance for loan losses the following table presents the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for the dates indicated at december  allocation loans as allocation loans as of the percent of the percent allowance of total allowance of total balance loans balance loans dollars in thousands commercial   real estate construction   real estate residential  consumer   unallocated portion of the allowance   total   at december  allocation loans as allocation loans as allocation loans as of the percent of the percent of the percent allowance of total allowance of total allowance of total balance loans balance loans balance loans dollars in thousands commercial    real estate construction    real estate residential    consumer    unallocated portion of the allowance    total    the increase in the allocation of commercial loans from december to december is primarily due to fluctuations in the balance of criticized loans and reallocation of specific reserves prior to the merger 
the company considers a loan to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of impairment may be based on i the present value of the expected cash flows of the impaired loan discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate  ii the observable market price of the impaired loan or iii the fair value of the collateral of a collateral dependent loan 
the company does not apply this definition to large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment 
in measuring impairment  the company reviews all impaired commercial and construction loans classified substandard and doubtful that meet materiality thresholds of thousand and thousand  respectively 
all loss classified loans are fully reserved under the company s standard loan loss reserve methodology 
the company considers classified loans below the established thresholds to represent immaterial loss risk 
commercial and construction loans that are not classified  and large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans such as installment  personal revolving credit  residential real estate and student loans  are evaluated collectively for impairment under the company s standard loan loss reserve methodology 
the company generally identifies loans to be reported as impaired when such loans are in non accrual status or are considered troubled debt restructurings due to the granting of a below market rate of interest or a partial forgiveness of indebtedness on an existing loan 
the following summarizes the company s impaired loans for the periods indicated at december  in thousands non accrual loans   other   total impaired loans   specific reserves   the million balance in loans classified as impaired as of december   other than non accrual loans  is due to two commercial real estate loans  with collateral exposure that may preclude ultimate full repayment  and two credits classified as trouble debt restructured  after forgiveness of principal on one and rewriting the other into two notes  one of which was written off 
the average balance of the company s impaired loans for the year ended december  was million compared to million in the amount of that recorded investment for which there is no related allowance for credit losses was in general  the company does not recognize any interest income on trouble debt restructurings or loans that are classified as non accrual 
for other impaired loans  interest income may be recorded as cash is received  provided that the company s recorded investment in such loans is deemed collectible 
asset and liability management the fundamental objective of the company s management of assets and liabilities is to maximize its economic value while maintaining adequate liquidity and a conservative level of interest rate risk 
the primary analytical tool used by the company to gauge interest rate sensitivity is a simulation model used by many major banks and bank regulators 
this industry standard model is used to simulate  based on the current and projected portfolio mix  the effects on net interest income of changes in market interest rates 
under the company s policy and practice  the projected amount of net interest income over the ensuing twelve months is not allowed to fluctuate more than percent  even under alternate assumed interest rate changes of plus or minus basis points 
the results of the model indicated that the mix of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at december  did not result in a fluctuation of net interest income exceeding percent 
in adjusting the company s asset liability position  management attempts to manage interest rate risk while enhancing net interest margins 
at times  depending on the level of general interest rates  the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  management may determine to increase the company s interest rate risk position somewhat in order to increase its net interest margin 
the company s results of operations and net portfolio values remain vulnerable to increases in interest rates and to fluctuations in the difference between long and short term interest rates 
interest rate risk one approach to quantify interest rate risk is to use a simulation model to project changes in net interest income nii that result from forecast changes in interest rates 
this analysis calculates the difference between a nii forecast over a month period using a flat interest rate scenario and a nii forecast using a rising or falling rate scenario  where the fed funds rate  serving as a driver  is made to rise or fall evenly by basis points over the month forecast interval triggering a response in the other rates 
according to the company s board policy  the simulated changes in nii should always be less than percent or steps must be taken to reduce interest rate risk 
according to the same policy  if the simulated changes in nii reach percent  a closer inspection of the risk will be put in place to determine what steps could be taken to control risk should it grow worse 
as can be seen from the results of the model illustrated as follows  the simulated change in nii  based on the month period ending december   falls well within the percent risk limits 
estimated increase changes in decrease in nii interest estimated rates nii amount amount percent basis points dollars in millions the company does not currently engage in trading activities or use derivative instruments to control interest rate risk  even though such activities may be permitted with the approval of the company s board of directors 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the company 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange risk  equity price risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities 
interest rate sensitivity analysis the following table summarizes the interest rate sensitivity gaps inherent in the company s asset and liability portfolios at december  repricing within over one non in millions days days days year repricing total assets investment securities  loans   other assets total assets    liabilities non interest bearing interest bearing transaction money market savings passbook savings time short term borrowings debt financing and notes payable other liabilities shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity    net liabilities assets subject to repricing  cumulative net liabilities assets subject to repricing the repricing terms of the table above do not represent contractual principal maturity  but rather principal cash flows available for repricing 
the interest rate sensitivity report shown above categorizes interest bearing transaction deposits and savings deposits as repricing within days 
however  it is the experience of management that the historical interest rate volatility of these interest bearing transaction and savings deposits can be similar to liabilities with longer repricing dates  depending on market conditions 
moreover  the degree to which these interest bearing transaction and savings deposits respond to changes in money market rates usually is less than the response of interest rate sensitive loans 
these factors cause the cumulative net liability position shown above to indicate a much greater degree of liability sensitivity than management believes really exists based on the additional analysis previously discussed 
liquidity the principal sources of asset liquidity are marketable investment securities available for sale 
at december   investment securities available for sale totaled  million 
in addition  the company generated significant liquidity from its operating activities 
the company s profitability in  and generated substantial cash flows provided from operations totaling million  million and million  respectively 
additional cash flows may be provided by financing activities  primarily the acceptance of customer deposits and short and long term borrowings from banks 
during and  deposits decreased million and million  respectively  which  added to the cash used by the company in its share repurchase program and other retirement of stock activities of million and million and dividends paid to the company s shareholders  exceeded a million increase in short term borrowings in and the issuance of million of the company s senior notes in these were the major factors in the total cash flows used by financing activities of million and million  respectively  for and comparatively  financing activities provided million in cash flows during  as a million increase in deposits and a million increase in short term funding exceeded payments on debt financing and long term notes payable  retirement of stock and dividends paid to shareholders 
the company uses cash flows to make investments in loans and investment securities 
net repayments of loans were million in  compared to million in and an increase in balances of million it is the intention of the company to increase loan volume without jeopardizing credit quality  this is the primary reason for investing excess cash flows in lower risk investments securities which increased million in this compares with a decrease in of million  mostly due to premerger activity at vallicorp and an increase of million in the company anticipates increasing its cash levels through the end of mainly due to increased profitability and retained earnings 
for the same period  it is anticipated that the investment securities portfolio and demand for loans will continue to moderately increase 
the growth in deposit balances is expected to follow the anticipated growth in loan and investment balances through the end of capital resources the current and projected capital position of the company and the impact of capital plans and long term strategies is reviewed regularly by management 
the company s capital position represents the level of capital available to support continued operations and expansion 
the company s primary capital resource is shareholders equity  which increased million or percent from the previous year end and increased million or percent from december  the ratio of total risk based capital to risk adjusted assets was percent at december   compared to percent at december  tier i risk based capital to risk adjusted assets was percent at december   compared to percent at december  capital to risk adjusted assets minimum regulatory capital at december  requirements tier i capital total capital leverage ratio the risk based capital ratios declined in as the increase in total assets outpaced the growth in equity 
capital ratios are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that capital exceeds the prescribed regulatory minimums and is adequate to meet the company s future needs 
all ratios are in excess of the regulatory definition of well capitalized 
adjusted for the three to one stock split  the board of directors of the company authorized  beginning in  the repurchase of  shares of common stock from time to time  subject to appropriate regulatory and other accounting requirements 
these purchases are made periodically in the open market and reduce the dilutive impact of issuing new shares to meet stock performance  option plans  acquisitions and other requirements

in  total average deposits decreased percent primarily related to decreases in savings and retail certificates of deposit 
a declining rate environment and the runoff of business after merger activity are the major reasons for this decline

in addition  financial services commissions were thousand higher than primarily due to increased sales volume and additional services provided and trust fees were thousand higher than including increased personal and retirement plan business 
partially offsetting these changes  credit card merchant fees were thousand lower than prior year  mortgage banking income was thousand lower due to lower refinancing volumes resulting in lower income from sales of loans and servicing fees  and deposit account fees were thousand lower due to reduced volume partially offset by higher account analysis fees assessed 
non interest income was million in  million higher than deposit account fees and merchant credit card income were thousand  each  higher than due to increased volume 
other was thousand higher  principally due to higher gains on asset sales and financial services commissions were thousand higher due to increased sales volume 
partially offsetting these changes  mortgage banking income was thousand lower than due to reduced servicing income and trust fees were thousand lower than prior year primarily due to account runoff

partially offsetting these changes  other non interest expense decreased million  principally due to merger integration and branch restructuring costs recognized at vallicorp during  in connection with its three acquisitions effected in february  march and september of that year  and its planned branch sales in the first and second quarters of that were approved by the board of directors of vallicorp holdings  inc at the end of in addition  expenses were reduced in in advertising and public relations  merchant credit card  insurance and other costs  primarily due to merger efficiencies 
comparing and  non interest expense decreased million 
lower expense in was in part due to one time costs  included in related to merger activity in that year and the company s continuing efforts to realize efficiencies through streamlining and consolidations of operations and strict cost controls 
these were the major reasons for the decreases in employee related  equipment  stationery and supplies  other real estate owned and insurance expenses 
in addition  the company benefited from the elimination of fdic premiums 
occupancy expenses increased from  as part of vallicorp s growth and expansion plans to consolidate various support and administrative functions in a centralized headquarters office 
data processing costs increased mostly due to vallicorp outsourcing certain data processing functions 
other non interest expenses increased from  reflecting merger integration and branch restructuring costs 
merger related activity accounted for the increases in advertising and public relations expenses and operational losses 
completing the total change  merchant credit card expenses also increased from  commensurate with the revenue growth in services provided to merchant customers 
the ratio of average assets per full time equivalent staff was million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the company s strategy to improve efficiency and consolidate operations after merger activity can be seen in the reduction of the average number of full time equivalent staff from  in to  and  in and  respectively 
provision for income tax the provision for income tax increased by million in mainly as a direct result of higher pretax income partially offset by an increase in tax exempt interest income from municipal securities and loans 
the provision of million reflects an effective tax rate of percent compared to provisions of million in and million in  representing effective tax rates of percent and percent  respectively
