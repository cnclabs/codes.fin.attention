the company s neostation family of windows based terminals and related software allows users to utilize substantially all of their existing computer systems and applications running on windows platforms  unix  mainframes and minicomputers  and access them across a network 
prior to focusing on the windows based terminal market  the company produced a line of network computers which offered similar capabilities but without the same level of focus on windows based environments 
the company s network computer product line was introduced in june prior to the introduction of its line of network computers  the company manufactured and marketed a family of desktop computing devices  including multimedia capable x window terminals
