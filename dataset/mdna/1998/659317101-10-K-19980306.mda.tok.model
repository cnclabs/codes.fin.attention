distribution 
the north face is a global company with operations in the united states  europe and canada 
to protect the integrity of the north face brand and ensure a high level of customer service  the company limits the distribution of its products to a select number of specialty retailers 
the company sells its products to approximately  wholesale customers representing approximately  store fronts 
additionally  the company s products are sold under a trademark licensing agreement in hong kong  japan and korea 
order cycle 
the north face currently is engaged primarily in a two season wholesale business  spring january to june and fall july to december 
wholesale customers place preseason orders  which generally are non cancelable  with the company from one to eight months prior to the beginning of the season 
reorders are placed throughout the season and products are shipped based on availability 
preseason orders have typically accounted for approximately of total sales to wholesale customers and historically have been an accurate indicator of actual product shipments  however  there can be no assurance that preseason orders will be an accurate indicator of actual product shipments in the future 
the company has decided to increase its investment in inventory of core products to better allow it to capture reorder opportunities 
accordingly  the foregoing percentages may decline in the future 
with the introduction of tekware and summit shops  the company expects that it increasingly will be supplying its products to its wholesale customers on a year round basis 
preseason orders for the spring season increased over preseason orders for the spring season 
production cycle 
based on preseason orders and expected reorders  the company places production orders with its contract manufacturers for an entire season three to five months before the beginning of the season 
fixed production prices are agreed upon approximately three months prior to placement of such production orders 
as a result  the company s production costs are relatively predictable one season in advance of the delivery of products 
in the past  the company and its wholesale customers were unable to maximize sales of the company s most popular products due to the company s strategy of determining production quantities based primarily on preseason orders 
as a result  the company frequently was unable to meet strong reorder demand for its most popular items 
in october  the company initiated a core inventory replenishment program in which its core products and materials are being inventoried for rapid reorder or manufacturing 
as a result of this new program  the company has maintained and will continue to maintain higher levels of inventories 
summit shops 
in  the north face introduced summit shops in order to increase sales to wholesale customers 
there were concept shops  precursors to the summit shops  opened in the first six months of and summit shops opened in the second half of  followed by an additional shops in the company expects to open a minimum of additional summit shops in summit shops are designed to showcase the company s products using more modern merchandising techniques  enhance the company s brand and increase sales  while minimizing capital investment 
an average square foot summit shop is expected to require a total investment by the company for furniture and fixtures of approximately  however  there can be no assurance that summit shops will not require substantially more total capital investment 
additionally  the company will incur certain additional marketing and monitoring expenses associated with summit shops 
the company s wholesale customers will operate the summit shops and own the inventory 
the company will retain ownership of the furniture and fixtures used in the summit shops 
company operated retail sales 
the north face currently operates nine retail stores  three outlets and one temporary outlet 
new stores and outlets are included in comparable store sales commencing in their thirteenth month of operation 
the company currently does not plan to open any additional retail stores in the near future because the company believes that summit shops will provide comparable merchandising and marketing benefits to those that are received from company operated retail stores  with a lower commitment of financial and operational resources and a higher return on investment 
the north face s gross margins for its company operated retail stores are higher than for sales to its wholesale customers 
consequently  due to the expected growing revenue contribution from the company s wholesale customers  the company s overall gross margins are expected to decline in the near term 
government tent sales 
the north face historically has produced tents for the marine corps 
the timing of these sales has fluctuated historically and is dependent on the company s obtaining and retaining contracts from the marine corps 
the timing of the sales under these contracts can significantly affect the company s quarterly results 
in september  the company received a new tent contract from the marine corps totaling approximately million with two options for an additional million each 
the company expects shipments to commence pursuant to this contract in there can be no assurance however  that the company will obtain any additional contracts to produce tents for the marine corps in the future

the company s business is subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations 
historically  the company has realized substantially all of its profits in the third quarter and has recognized losses during the second quarter  and  until  the first quarter 
the company s results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of  among other things  the amount and timing of shipments to wholesale customers  government shipments  the timing and magnitude of discounts in retail stores  advertising and marketing expenditures  increases in the number of employees and overhead to support growth and store opening costs 
the company anticipates that it will continue to incur net losses during the second calendar quarter for the foreseeable future 
additionally  the company s effective tax rate can vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to the relative mix of earnings from the company s domestic and international operations  which are taxed at different rates 
finally  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be profitable in the first quarter 
liquidity and capital resources throughout  the company used cash of approximately million for operations  primarily due to increased levels of inventory and accounts receivable and million for purchases of fixed assets 
these funds were provided by existing cash balances and borrowings under the company s credit facility 
historically  the company s ability to maintain adequate levels of inventory was constrained by its capital resources 
as a result of increases in its credit facility as well as the company s public offerings in  the company increased its level of inventory in order to better enable it to meet reorder demand for its key products 
the company anticipates that inventory and receivable levels will continue to increase as the company expands its business and continues to enhance its core inventory replenishment program 
anticipated increases in inventory are expected to be financed by borrowings under the company s credit facility 
the company s credit facility currently provides for borrowings up to million under its revolving line of credit  with actual borrowings limited to the lesser of million or available collateral approximately million of gross availability as of december  of which the company had million outstanding at december  at an average interest rate of  and for borrowings of up to million under a term note for capital expenditures  which was fully utilized as of december  the credit facility also provides a sublimit for letters of credit of up to million to finance the company s purchases of merchandise inventories from foreign suppliers 
at december   the company had approximately million outstanding under this letter of credit facility 
additionally  europe had approximately million outstanding letters of credit as of december  the credit facility contains certain financial covenants with which the company was in compliance as of december  the company estimates that its capital expenditures in will be approximately to million 
this amount will be used principally for investing in summit shops  the upgrade of management information systems  the expansion of the company s administration and distribution facilities  the construction of the new technology center  the expansion of its european sales and marketing operations  and remodeling of its existing stores 
the company anticipates that cash generated from operations  cash available under the company s credit facility  and cash through an expected increase in its overall credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements for at least the next months 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional capital in or subsequent years 
foreign exchange fluctuation the company s inventory purchases from contract manufacturers in the far east are denominated in united states dollars  however  purchase prices for the company s products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturers  which may have the effect of increasing the company s cost of goods in the future 
in addition  the company s sales in europe and canada are denominated in the local currencies of the applicable specialty retailer  which may have a negative impact on profit margins or the rate of growth of sales in those countries if the us dollar were to strengthen significantly 
due to the number of foreign currencies involved and the fact that not all of these foreign currencies fluctuate in the same manner against the united states dollar  the company cannot quantify in any meaningful way the potential effect of such fluctuations on future income 
the company engages in certain forward foreign exchange hedging activities with respect to its european and canadian inventory purchases and sales 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
inflation the company believes that the relatively moderate rates of inflation over the last two years in the united states  where it primarily competes  have not had a significant effect on its net sales or results of operations 
higher rates of inflation have been experienced in a number of foreign countries in which the company s products are manufactured but also have not had a material effect on the company s net sales or results of operations 
in the past  the company has been able to offset its cost increases by increasing selling prices or changing suppliers 
asia currency crisis the company may be affected by the current devaluation of the asian currencies due to the company s importing of raw materials to asia 
furthermore  the company may be affected by economic and political conditions in each of the countries in which it operates 
risks associated with operating in the international arena include i economic instability  including the possible revaluation of currencies  ii extreme currency exchange fluctuations where the company has not entered into foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage exposure to certain foreign currency commitments hedged any forward transactions  iii changes to import or export regulations including quotas  iv labor or civil unrest  and v in certain parts of the world  political instability 
the company has not as yet been materially affected by any such risks  but cannot predict the likelihood of such developments occurring or the impact of any such risks to the future profitability of the company
