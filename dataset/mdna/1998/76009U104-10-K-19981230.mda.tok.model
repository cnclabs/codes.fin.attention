this increase in net cash provided by financing activities was principally due to funds received from the company s public stock offering and funds drawn on the company s credit facility in connection with the champion acquisition see note to financial statements 
historically  the company s growth has been financed through internally generated working capital  borrowings under its available credit facilities and  in connection with acquisitions  issuances of its common stock  preferred stock and convertible debt 
during fiscal  the company s acquisitions were financed by a combination of cash generated by the company s public stock offering and borrowings under the amended facility 
the company s primary requirements for capital other than those related to acquisitions consist of purchasing additional rental merchandise and replacing rental merchandise that has been sold or is no longer suitable for rent 
the company intends to increase the number of stores it operates primarily through acquisitions 
such acquisitions will vary in size and the company will consider large acquisitions that could be material to the company 
to provide any additional funds necessary for the continued pursuit of its growth strategies  the company may incur  from time to time  additional short and long term bank or other institutional indebtedness and may issue  in public or private transactions  its equity and debt securities  the availability of which will depend upon market and other conditions 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s major market risk exposure is primarily due to possible fluctuations in interest rates 
the company s policy is to manage interest rate risk by utilizing interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of the floating interest rate debt to fixed interest rates 
the company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the interest rate swap agreements are entered into with major financial institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss 
the following table presents information about the company s market sensitive financial instruments

this trend is expected to continue in the foreseeable future
