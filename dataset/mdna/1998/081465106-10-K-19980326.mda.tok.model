if dairy commodity prices remain at higher levels  there is the possibility that these costs will not be passed on to consumers which will negatively impact future gross profit margins

these risks are discussed below in risk factors in this document 
risk factors dependence on independent ice cream distributors 
the company is dependent on maintaining satisfactory relationships with independent ice cream distributors that now generally act as the company s exclusive or master distributor in their assigned territories 
while the company believes its relationships with dreyer s and its other distributors generally have been satisfactory and have been instrumental in the company s growth  the company has at times experienced difficulty in maintaining such relationships to its satisfaction 
available distribution alternatives are limited 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that difficulties in maintaining relationships with distributors  which may be related to actions by the company s competitors or by one or more of the company s distributors themselves or their controlling persons  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the loss of one or more of the company s principal distributors or termination of one or more of the related distribution agreements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
in early dreyer s made overtures to ben cohen and jerry greenfield  the company s co founders  to obtain their support for an offer that dreyer s would make to acquire the company

growth in sales and earnings 
in  net sales of the company increased to million from million in pint volume increased compared to the super premium ice cream  frozen yogurt and sorbet industry category sales decreased in as compared to given these overall domestic super premium industry trends  the successful introduction of innovative flavors on a periodic basis has become increasingly important to any sales growth by the company 
accordingly  the future degree of market acceptance of any of the company s new products  which will be accompanied by promotional expenditures  is likely to have an important impact on the company s and future financial results 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations 
competitive environment 
the super premium frozen dessert market is highly competitive with the distinctions between the super premium category  and the adjoining premium and premium plus categories less marked than in the past 
and  as noted above  the ability to successfully introduce innovative flavors on a periodic basis that are accepted by the marketplace is a significant competitive factor 
in addition  the company s principal competitors are large  diversified companies with resources significantly greater than the company s 
the company expects strong competition to continue  including competition for adequate distribution and competition for the limited shelf space for the frozen dessert category in supermarkets and other retail food outlets 
see business competition and business the super premium frozen dessert market 
increased cost of raw materials management believes that the trend of increased dairy ingredient commodity costs may continue and it is possible that at some future date both gross margins and earnings may not be protected by pricing adjustments  cost control programs and productivity gains 
reliance on a limited number of key personnel 
the success of the company is significantly dependent on the services of perry odak  the chief executive officer and a limited number of executive managers working under mr 
odak  as well as certain continued services of ben cohen  the chairperson of the board and co founder of the company  and jerry greenfield  vice chairperson and co founder of the company 
loss of the services of any of these persons could have a material adverse effect on the company s business

the company s basic business philosophy is embodied in a three part mission statement  which includes a social mission to operate the company in a way that actively recognizes the central role that business plays in the structure of society by initiating innovative ways to improve the quality of life of a broad community local  national and international 
underlying the mission of ben jerry s is the determination to seek new and creative ways of addressing all three parts  while holding a deep respect for individuals inside and outside the company and for the communities of which they are a part 
the company believes that implementation of its social mission  which is integrated into the company s business  has been beneficial to the company s overall financial performance

see introduction and business marketing 
international 
the company s principal competitors have substantial market shares in various countries outside the united states  principally europe and japan 
the company sells product in canada  the united kingdom  ireland  france  the netherlands and belgium and will start selling in japan in the company also has licensing agreements in israel  signed in  and a licensing letter of intent relating to singapore  malaysia  indonesia and the united arab emirates  signed in the company is investigating the possibility of further international expansion 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in entering directly or indirectly through licensing  on a long term profitable basis  such international markets as it selects 
control of the company 
the company has two classes of common stock the class a common stock  entitled to one vote per share  and the class b common stock authorized in  entitled  except to the extent otherwise provided by law  to ten votes per share 
ben cohen  jerry greenfield  and jeffrey furman collectively  the principal stockholders hold shares representing of the aggregate voting power in elections for directors  permitting them as a practical matter to elect all members of the board of directors and thereby effectively control the business  policies and management of the company 
because of their significant holdings of class b common stock  the principal stockholders may continue to exercise this control even if they were to sell substantial portions of their class a common stock 
see security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management 
in addition  the company issued all of the authorized class a preferred stock to the foundation in all current directors of the foundation are directors of the company 
the class a preferred stock gives the foundation a class voting right to act with respect to certain business combinations as defined in the company s charter and significantly limits the voting rights that holders of the class a common stock and class b common stock  the owners of virtually all of the equity in the company  would otherwise have with respect to such business combinations 
see business the ben jerry s foundation 
while the board of directors believes that the class b common stock and the class a preferred stock are important elements in keeping ben jerry s an independent  vermont based business focused on its three part corporate mission  the class b common stock and the class a preferred stock may be deemed to be anti takeover provisions in that the board of directors believes the existence of these securities will make it difficult for a third party to acquire control of the company on terms opposed by the holders of the class b common stock  including primarily the principal stockholders  or the foundation  or for incumbent management and the board of directors to be removed 
in addition  the amendments to the company s articles of association to classify the board of directors and to add certain other related provisions see anti takeover effects of class b common stock  class a common stock  class a preferred stock and classified board of directors in item may be deemed to be anti takeover provisions in that the board of directors believes that these amendments will make it difficult for a third party to acquire control of the company on terms opposed by the holders of the class b common stock  including primarily the principal stockholders and the foundation  or for incumbent management and the board of directors to be removed
