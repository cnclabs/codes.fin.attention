scott  columbia hca healthcare corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued investigations and changes in management and business strategy continued chairman and chief executive officer and david t 
vandewater  president and chief operating officer 
thomas f 
frist  jr  md  vice chairman of the company s board of directors  was named chairman and chief executive officer 
on august   the company named jack o 
bovender  jr 
as president and chief operating officer 
on august   in an effort to address some areas of concern that may have led to the investigations by certain government agencies  management announced several significant steps that are being implemented to redefine the company s approach to a number of business practices 
some of the steps include elimination of annual cash incentive compensation for the company s employees  divestiture of the home health care business  unwinding of physician interests in hospitals  significant expansion of compliance programs  increased disclosures in medicare cost reports  changes in laboratory billing procedures  increased reviews of medicare coding and further guidelines on any transactions with physicians 
these changes have been developed and are being implemented with consideration to laws  regulations and existing contractual agreements 
management is not currently able to predict what effect such actions might have on the company s financial position or results of operations 
on november   the company announced that its board of directors had approved an internal operating reorganization plan 
effective january   the company was organized into five principal groups eastern  western  atlantic  pacific and america 
the board of directors also authorized the evaluation of various restructuring alternatives which could include divestitures of certain assets to third parties and spin offs of certain other assets to the company s stockholders 
as part of these alternatives  the company is considering restructuring into a smaller  more focused company located in strategic markets 
no restructuring plan has been approved by the board and there can be no assurances that a plan will ultimately be approved or implemented 
any spin off or other restructuring alternative would require board of directors approval as well as various legal  regulatory and governmental approvals 
business strategy the company s strategy is to be a comprehensive provider of quality health care services in select markets 
the company maintains and replaces equipment  renovates and constructs replacement facilities and adds new services to increase the attractiveness of its hospitals and other facilities to local physicians and patients 
by developing a comprehensive health care network with a broad range of health care services located throughout a market area  the company achieves greater visibility and is better able to attract and serve physicians and patients 
the company is also able to reduce operating costs by sharing certain services among several facilities in the same market and is better positioned to work with health maintenance organizations hmos  preferred provider organizations ppos and employers 
the company generally seeks to operate each of its facilities as part of a network with other health care facilities that it owns or operates within the same region 
in instances where acquisitions of additional facilities in the area are not possible or practical  the company may seek joint ventures or partnership arrangements with other local facilities 
columbia hca healthcare corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations background information value health merger on august   the company completed a merger transaction with value health  inc value health the value health merger 
value health is a provider of specialty managed care benefit programs 
the value health merger has been accounted for by the purchase method and accordingly  the results of operations of value health have been included with those of the company for periods subsequent to the acquisition date see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
discontinued operations as part of the company s change in business strategy  the company implemented a plan to sell its home health care business and divest three of the four business units acquired through the value health merger 
as a result of the plan to divest these businesses  the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes have been adjusted and restated to reflect the results of operations and net assets of the home health care and value health businesses to be disposed of as discontinued operations see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
healthtrust merger in april  the company completed a merger transaction with healthtrust  inc the hospital company healthtrust the healthtrust merger 
for accounting purposes  the healthtrust merger was treated as a pooling of interests 
accordingly  the accompanying consolidated financial statements and selected financial and operating data included in this discussion and analysis include the operations of healthtrust for all periods presented 
revenue volume trends in addition to the impact of the ongoing government investigations and related media coverage  the company s revenues continue to be affected by the trend toward certain services being performed more frequently on an outpatient basis and an increasing proportion of revenue being derived from fixed payment sources  including medicare  medicaid and managed care plans 
admissions related to medicare  medicaid and managed care plan patients during  and were  and  respectively  of total admissions 
insurance companies  government programs other than medicare and employers purchasing health care services for their employees are negotiating discounted amounts that they will pay health care providers rather than paying standard prices 
these purchasers then become discounted payers  similar to hmos and ppos  in virtually all markets and make it increasingly difficult for providers to maintain their historical revenue growth trends 
revenues from capitation arrangements prepaid health service agreements are less than of consolidated revenues 
the growth in outpatient services is expected to continue in the health care industry as procedures performed on an inpatient basis are converted to outpatient procedures through continuing advances in pharmaceutical and medical technologies 
the redirection of certain columbia hca healthcare corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations continued revenue volume trends continued procedures to an outpatient basis is also influenced by pressures from payers to direct certain procedures from inpatient care to outpatient care 
outpatient revenues grew to of net patient revenues in from in and in the company expects patient volumes from medicare and medicaid to continue to increase due to the general aging of the population and the expansion of the state medicaid programs 
the medicare program currently reimburses the company under a prospective payment system pps for routine and ancillary operating costs of most medicare inpatient services 
pps reimburses the company primarily based on established rates that are dependent on each patient s diagnosis  regardless of the provider s cost to treat the patient or the length of time the patient stays in the hospital 
some inpatient services and most outpatient services are currently exempt from pps and are reimbursed on a cost based system in which reimbursement is based primarily upon the provider s cost to treat the patient and certain government fee schedules and blended rates  subject to certain cost limits 
under the balanced budget act of the bba  reimbursement for some inpatient and outpatient services previously reimbursed on a cost based system is being converted to the pps method  effective over various periods  beginning june  services being converted to the pps method include skilled nursing facility services  hospital outpatient services  home health services and inpatient rehabilitation hospital services 
prior to the commencement to the pps method  payment constraints will be applied to home health services and inpatient rehabilitation  psychiatric and long term hospital services for medicare cost reporting periods beginning on or after october  the medicare program s established rates are indexed for inflation annually  but these increases have historically been less than the actual inflation rate and the company s increases to its standard charges 
bba reduces reimbursements from the various states medicaid programs in addition to the medicare program 
management believes the reduction in payments could be significant  but cannot at this time  predict the ultimate effect on the company s future results of operations 
reductions in medicare reimbursement  increasing percentages of the patient volume being related to patients participating in managed care plans and continuing trends toward more services being performed on an outpatient basis are expected to present an ongoing challenge to the company 
to achieve and maintain a reasonable operating margin in the future periods  the company must increase patient volumes while controlling the costs of providing services 
management believes that the proper response to this challenge includes the delivery of a broad range of quality health care services to patients through comprehensive health care networks with operating decisions being made by the local management teams and local physicians

changes from prior year revenues income from continuing operations before income taxes income from continuing operations basic earnings per share from continuing operations diluted earnings per share from continuing operations admissions a equivalent admissions b revenues per equivalent admission same facility changes from prior year c revenues admissions a equivalent admissions b revenues per equivalent admission a admissions represent the total number of patients admitted in the facility for a period in excess of hours to the company s hospitals 
b equivalent admissions is used by management and certain investors as a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume 
equivalent admissions are computed by multiplying admissions inpatient volume by the sum of gross inpatient revenue and gross outpatient revenue and then dividing the resulting amount by gross inpatient revenue 
the equivalent admissions computation equates outpatient revenue to the volume measure admissions used to measure inpatient volume resulting in a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume 
c same facility information excludes the operations of hospitals and their related facilities which were either acquired or divested during the current and prior year 
columbia hca healthcare corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations continued years ended december  and income from continuing operations before income taxes declined to million in from billion in and pretax margins decreased to in from in the decrease in pretax income was primarily attributable to the impairment charges on long lived assets  restructuring and investigation related costs  a decline in revenue growth rates and decreases in the operating margin 
excluding the asset impairment charges and restructuring and investigation related costs  income from continuing operations before income taxes declined to million in from billion in and pretax margins decreased to in from in the operating results declines  excluding the significant non recurring charges  were attributable to declines in revenue growth rates and increases in operating expenses as a percent of revenues 
revenues increased to billion in compared to billion in inpatient admissions increased from a year ago 
on a same facility basis  revenues increased  admissions increased and equivalent admissions adjusted to reflect combined inpatient and outpatient volume increased from a year ago 
the increase in outpatient activity is primarily a result of the continuing trend of certain services  previously being provided in an inpatient setting  being converted to an outpatient setting average daily outpatient visits increased in compared to the volume growth rates experienced in were less than the rates experienced in prior years  which management believes was due  in part  to the reactions of certain physicians and patients to the negative media coverage related to the ongoing governmental investigations and increased competition 
the revenue growth rate in was less than rates experienced in prior years which management believes was attributable to several factors  including  divestitures of facilities there were fewer consolidated facilities at the end of compared to  delays experienced in obtaining medicare cost report settlements cost report settlements resulted in favorable revenue adjustments of million in compared to million in and decreases in medicare rates of reimbursement mandated by bba which became effective october  lowered revenues by approximately million 
also contributing to the decline were continued increases in discounts from the growing number of managed care payers which required management to increase estimates for discounts from managed care payers 
during  managed care as a percent of total admissions increased to compared to during net revenues per equivalent admission declined to  in from  in operating expenses increased as a percentage of revenues in every expense category 
the increases  as described below  were primarily attributable to the company s inability during the third and fourth quarters of to adjust expenses on a timely basis in line with the decreases experienced in volume trends 
management attention to the investigations  reactions by certain physicians and patients to the negative media coverage and management changes at several levels and locations throughout the company contributed to the company s inability to implement changes to reduce operating expenses in response to the volume and revenue growth rate declines 
columbia hca healthcare corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations continued years ended december  and continued salaries and benefits  as a percentage of revenues  increased to in from in the primary reason for the increase was the decline in revenues per equivalent admission 
in addition  the company was unable to adjust staffing on a timely basis corresponding with the declining equivalent admission growth rate 
supply costs increased as a percentage of revenues to in from in due to a decline in net revenue per equivalent admission while the cost of supplies per equivalent admission remained relatively unchanged 
other operating expenses  as a percentage of revenues  increased to in from in the increase was due  in part  to an increase in contract services as a percentage of revenues to in from in  which resulted from payments to third parties on a fee basis for both new services and services previously performed by company employees 
included in other operating expenses in are costs associated with start up activities which were previously capitalized and subsequently amortized 
the company changed its policy on accounting for start up costs effective january   which resulted in approximately million being recorded as other operating expenses for  compared to such costs being capitalized and the related expense recorded as amortization expense during see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
also included in other operating expenses are professional fees  repairs and maintenance  rents and leases  utilities  insurance and non income taxes 
there were no significant changes in any of these expenses as a percentage of revenues 
provision for doubtful accounts  as a percentage of revenues  increased to in from in due to internal factors such as computer information system conversions including patient accounting systems at various facilities and external factors such as payer mix shifts to managed care plans resulting in increased amounts of patient co payments and deductibles and payer remittance slowdowns 
the information system conversions hampered the business office billing functions and collection efforts in those facilities as some resources were directed to installing and converting systems and building new data files  rather than devoting full effort to billing and collecting receivables 
the company experienced an increased occurrence of charge audits from certain payers due to the negative publicity surrounding the government investigations which have resulted in delays in the collection of receivables 
the delays in collections resulted in an increase in receivables reserved under the company s bad debt allowance policy 
management is unable at this time to predict when or if  these delays in collecting accounts receivable will improve or the effect these delays will have on the ultimate amounts collected 
equity in earnings of affiliates decreased as a percentage of revenues to in from in primarily due to decreased profitability at certain facilities acquired through joint ventures during and offsetting the decreased profitability were increases in the number of facilities accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
as of december   there were hospitals and five freestanding surgery centers compared to hospitals and four freestanding surgery centers at december  depreciation and amortization increased as a percentage of revenues to in from in  primarily due to the slowdown in revenue growth and increased capital columbia hca healthcare corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations continued years ended december  and continued expenditures related to ancillary services such as outpatient services and information systems 
capital expenditures in these areas generally result in shorter depreciation and amortization lives for the assets acquired than typical hospitals acquisitions 
included in the overall increase in depreciation and amortization was a decrease in amortization during related to the company s new policy of expensing start up costs through operating expenses rather than capitalizing and expensing through amortization 
interest expense increased to million in compared to million last year primarily as a result of an increase in the average outstanding debt during compared to last year 
this was due  in part  to the additional debt incurred in related to the company s billion common stock repurchase program 
the interest expense associated with the increase in debt incurred related to the value health merger has been allocated to discontinued operations and is therefore not included in interest expense from continuing operations 
during  the company recorded million of asset impairment charges 
the charges primarily relate to hospital and surgery center facilities to be sold or closed million and physician practices where projected future cash flows were less than the carrying value of the related assets million 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company incurred million of costs during in connection with the investigations and changes in management and business strategy 
these costs included million in severance costs  million in professional fees related to the investigations  million related to certain cancelled projects and million in other costs 
minority interests increased slightly as a percentage of revenues to in from in income from continuing operations decreased to million 
per diluted share during compared to billion per diluted share in excluding the asset write downs  restructuring and investigation related costs  income from continuing operations declined to million 
per diluted share in from billion per diluted share in years ended december  and income from continuing operations before income taxes increased to billion in from billion in and pretax margins increased to in from in excluding the effects of merger and facility consolidation costs charged in  income from continuing operations before income taxes increased to billion from billion in and pretax margins increased to in from in the increase in pretax income was attributable to growth in revenues and improvements in the margin 
revenues increased to billion in compared to billion in revenues from facilities acquired during including hospitals and increased revenues from facilities acquired during including hospitals totaled billion 
the revenue increases from acquisitions were partially offset by million in revenues related to facilities sold and facilities contributed to joint ventures which are accounted for under the equity method 
columbia hca healthcare corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations continued years ended december  and continued on a same facility basis  revenues increased  admissions increased and equivalent admissions adjusted to reflect combined inpatient and outpatient volume increased from a year ago 
the increase in outpatient activity is primarily a result of continued increases in outpatient services 
salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenues declined to in from in this was due  in part  to improvements in labor productivity man hours per equivalent admission declined resulting from the sharing of best demonstrated processes among certain company facilities 
the outsourcing of certain services services outsourced at various facilities  included  among others  laboratory  rehabilitation  dietary and linen services also contributed to the improvement in this area while shifting some salaries and benefits cost to other operating expenses 
supply costs declined as a percentage of revenues to in from in due to enhanced levels of participation in the company s standard purchasing contracts for medical supplies which provide for progressive discounts based upon the volume of purchases made by the company 
the improvement in pretax margin was partially offset by increases in other operating expenses and the provision for doubtful accounts 
other operating expenses  as a percentage of revenues  increased to in from in this was primarily due to contract services expense which increased to from of revenues in the prior year 
contributing to this increase was the outsourcing of certain services which are paid on a fee basis to third parties for services previously performed by company employees 
also included in other operating expenses are professional fees  repairs and maintenance  rents and leases  utilities  insurance and non income taxes 
there were no significant changes in any of these expenses as a percent of revenues 
provision for doubtful accounts  as a percent of revenues  increased to in from in due  in part  to computer information system conversions including patient accounting systems at various facilities 
the information systems conversions hampered the business office billing functions and collection efforts in those facilities as some facility resources were directed to installing and converting systems and building new data files rather than devoting their full effort to billing and collecting receivables 
equity in earnings of affiliates increased as a percentage of revenues to in from in primarily due to more of the company s development activities being structured as non consolidated joint ventures 
as of december   there were non consolidated hospitals and non consolidated surgery centers compared to non consolidated hospitals and non consolidated surgery centers at december  most joint venture activity occurred during the fourth quarter 
depreciation and amortization increased as a percentage of revenues to in from in primarily due to increased capital expenditures in outpatient services and information systems areas  all of which generally result in shorter depreciation and amortization lives for the assets acquired than typical hospital acquisitions 
columbia hca healthcare corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations continued years ended december  and continued interest expense and minority interests in earnings of consolidated entities as a percentage of revenues remained relatively flat compared to last year 
during  the company recorded million of merger and facility consolidation costs in connection with the healthtrust merger 
the company did not record any such costs in income from continuing operations increased to billion per diluted share during compared to billion per diluted share in excluding the effects of the merger and facility consolidation costs in  income from continuing operations increased to billion per diluted share in compared to billion per diluted share in liquidity cash provided by continuing operating activities totaled billion in compared to billion in and billion in the decrease in from and was primarily due to the million net loss incurred during also contributing to the decline was an increase in income taxes receivable resulting from estimated tax payments made based upon more profitable prior quarters subsequent to year end  the company applied for and received a refund for approximately million of excess estimated payment amounts 
the cash flow impact of the approximate billion decline in net income from to was partially offset by the significant noncash charges incurred in related to asset impairments and discontinued operations of approximately million 
cash used in investing activities in exceeded cash provided by continuing operating activities by billion and was funded by the issuance of long term debt  commercial paper and bank borrowings 
included in investing activities for is the cash required to acquire value health  inc approximately billion 
during  cash flows provided by continuing operating activities exceeded cash used in investing activities by million 
the excess funds generated from operations were used to pay down long term debt and commercial paper borrowings 
cash flows from investing activities during exceeded cash provided by continuing operating activities by billion primarily due to billion in acquisitions of hospitals and health care entities 
the acquisitions were funded by the issuance of long term debt  commercial paper and bank borrowings 
the company repurchased approximately million shares of its common stock pursuant to its billion stock repurchase program announced and completed in the repurchase was funded by the issuance of long term debt  commercial paper and bank borrowings 
working capital totaled billion at december  and billion at december  management believes that cash flows from operations  amounts available under the company s bank revolving credit facilities and proceeds from expected asset sales will be sufficient to meet expected liquidity needs during investments of the company s professional liability insurance subsidiary to maintain statutory equity and pay claims totaled billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
columbia hca healthcare corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations continued liquidity continued as discussed previously  the company announced the cessation of sales of interests in hospitals to physicians and its intention to repurchase existing physician interests in the company s hospitals 
as of december   the company had repurchased approximately million of physician interests and intends to repurchase the remaining physician interests of approximately million during or the company has various agreements with joint venture partners whereby the partners have an option to sell or put their interests in the joint venture back to the company within specific periods at fixed prices or prices based on certain formulas 
the combined put price under all such agreements was approximately billion at december  the company cannot predict if  or when  their joint venture partners will exercise such options no put options have been exercised through december  
during march  the internal revenue service irs issued guidance regarding the tax consequences of joint ventures between for profit and not for profit hospitals 
the company has not determined the impact of the tax ruling on its existing joint ventures and is consulting with its joint venture partners and tax advisers to develop an appropriate course of action 
the tax ruling could require the restructing of certain joint ventures with not for profits or influence the exercise of the put agreements by certain joint venture partners 
the company has announced agreements to sell value behavioral health and value rx businesses recently acquired through the value health merger  for million and million in cash  respectively 
the sales of both businesses are expected to be completed during the second quarter of and the net proceeds will be used to repay bank borrowings see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the settlement of the government investigations and the various lawsuits and legal proceedings that have been asserted could result in substantial liabilities to the company 
the ultimate liabilities cannot be reasonably estimated  as to the timing or amounts  at this time  however  it is possible that results of operations  financial position and liquidity could be materially  adversely affected upon the resolution of certain of these contingencies 
capital resources excluding acquisitions  capital expenditures were billion in both and and billion in planned capital expenditures including construction projects in are expected to approximate billion 
management believes that its capital expenditure program is adequate to expand  improve and equip its existing health care facilities 
the company expended million excluding the value health merger  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  million and billion for acquisitions during  and  respectively 
the continued decline in acquisitions from prior years can be partially attributed to increased regulatory review procedures in certain states that have extended the timing between the initiation and consummation of certain transactions 
the government investigations and changes in management and business strategy have resulted in declines in the company s acquisition plans compared to prior years 
the company s investments in and advances to affiliates generally interests in joint ventures that are accounted for using the equity method also declined to million and million in and  respectively  compared to million in columbia hca healthcare corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations continued capital resources continued the company expects to finance all capital expenditures with internally generated and borrowed funds 
available sources of capital include public or private debt  unused bank revolving credit facilities and equity 
at december   there were projects under construction which had an estimated additional cost to complete and equip over the next few years of approximately billion 
the company s bank revolving credit facilities the credit facilities are comprised of a billion five year revolving credit agreement expiring february and a billion day revolving credit agreement expiring june borrowings under the day revolving credit agreement do not mature until one year subsequent to the end of the day period 
as of february   columbia had approximately million of credit available under the credit facilities 
the company s credit facilities contain customary covenants which include i limitations on additional debt  ii limitations on sales of assets  mergers and changes of ownership  iii limitations on repurchases of the company s common stock  iv maintenance of certain interest coverage ratios and v attaining certain minimum levels of consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the credit facilities also provide for the mandatory prepayment of loans thereunder  and a corresponding reduction of commitments in the case of certain asset sales and certain debt or equity issuances 
the company is currently in compliance with all such covenants 
during  the company s senior debt credit ratings were downgraded from a to baa and from a to bbb by moody s investors service moody s and standard and poor s s p  respectively 
the company s commercial paper ratings were downgraded from p to p and from a to a by moody s and s p  respectively 
the decline in the company s commercial paper ratings has significantly limited access to this financing source 
as such  during the third quarter of  the company began replacing amounts outstanding under its commercial paper programs with borrowings under its credit facilities 
in february  moody s further downgraded the company s senior debt credit rating to ba and its commercial paper rating to np not prime 
as part of the company s new business strategy discussed earlier  the company announced it is evaluating various restructuring alternatives which could include divestitures of certain assets to third parties and spin offs of certain assets to the company s shareholders 
these restructuring alternatives could have the effect of materially changing the capital structure of the company 
at this time  management has not determined the composition of the future capital structure of the company 
impact of year computer issues the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
the company s computer programs  certain building infrastructure components including  elevators  alarm systems and certain hvac systems and certain computer aided medical equipment that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruption of operations or medical equipment malfunctions that could affect patient diagnosis and treatment 
columbia hca healthcare corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued impact of year computer issues continued the company has completed the assessment phase of its year project and determined that it will be required to evaluate  test and modify when needed approximately  internally developed software programs and approximately  pieces of equipment 
the company presently believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose material operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company has initiated formal communications with its significant suppliers and large customers to determine the extent to which the company s interface systems are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted and would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram or replace and test software and medical equipment for year modifications 
the company anticipates that the various components of the year project procedures will continue throughout and the year project is currently estimated to have a minimum total cost of million related to the review and modification of the company s computer and software systems 
the company is not able to reasonably estimate the costs to be incurred for the review and modification of the medical equipment and infrastructure elements at this time 
the majority of the costs related to the year project will be expensed as incurred and are expected to be funded through operating cash flows 
the company has incurred approximately million of costs related to the assessment of  and preliminary efforts on its year project 
the costs of the project and estimated completion dates for the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes and all medical equipment 
effects of inflation and changing prices various federal  state and local laws have been enacted that  in certain cases  limit the company s ability to increase prices 
revenues for acute care hospital services rendered to medicare patients are established under the federal government s prospective payment system 
total medicare revenues approximated in  in and in management believes that hospital industry operating margins have been  and may continue to be  under significant pressure because of deterioration in inpatient volumes  changes in payer mix  and growth in operating expenses in excess of the increase in prospective payments under the medicare program 
management expects that the average rate of increase in medicare prospective payments will range from no increase to a increase in in addition  as a result of increasing regulatory and competitive pressures  the company s ability to maintain operating margins through price increases to non medicare patients is limited 
columbia hca healthcare corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued health care reform in recent years  an increasing number of legislative proposals have been introduced or proposed to congress and in some state legislatures that would significantly affect health care systems in the company s markets 
the cost of certain proposals would be funded in significant part by reduction in payments by government programs  including medicare and medicaid  to health care providers similar to the reductions incurred as part of bba as previously discussed 
while the company is unable to predict which  if any  proposals for health care reform will be adopted  there can be no assurance that proposals adverse to the business of the company will not be adopted 
other information the company is contesting income taxes and related interest proposed by the irs for prior years aggregating approximately million as of december  management believes that final resolution of these disputes will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position  results of operations or liquidity of the company 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the pending irs disputes 
subsequent event subsequent to year end  the company announced agreements to sell value behavioral health and value rx two of the three value health units to be divested for million and million in cash  respectively
