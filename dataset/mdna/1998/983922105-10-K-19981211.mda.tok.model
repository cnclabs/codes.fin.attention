item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report contains trend analysis and other forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the trend analysis and other forward looking statements contained herein  as a result of the risk factors set forth below and other cautionary language contained elsewhere in this report 
results of operations in thousands change change net sales    net sales versus net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to increased net sales of lan adapters  modems and multifunction lan and modem cards combo cards collectively adapter products  which connect notebook pcs to networks  the internet and online services 
the increase in net sales of adapter products was primarily due to growth in overall market demand for local and wide area network connectivity products and an increase in unit sales of the company s adapter products by its distribution and oem customers 
the growth in channel sell through may be indicative of several factors an increased growth rate in shipments of notebook pcs  which in turn require network connections  increased sales of the company s modem only pc card products  continuing increased market acceptance of the company s combo cards and fast ethernet cards  the introduction of the company s realport integrated pc card family of products  and the company s competitive pricing strategy 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company reduced shipments to its distributors in order to reduce the levels of inventories held by its distributors and enable the company to quickly react to market changes 
unit shipments of adapter products increased in over but average selling prices declined due to increased competition in the pc card lan adapter market 
revenues from the company s pc card products as a percentage of total revenues were as follows percentage of total revenue lan adapters lan modem modem international sales 
total international sales shipments to customers located outside the us as a percentage of total sales was in both and pc card sales in the us and europe grew at a faster rate than in asia pacific largely due to the economic turmoil in the asian markets 
net sales versus net sales increased in as compared to primarily due to growth in overall market demand for local and wide area network connectivity products and an increase in unit sales of the company s adapter products by its distribution and oem customers 
unit shipments of adapter products increased in over but average selling prices and gross profit declined due to increased competition in the pc card lan adapter market and to the continued shift in product mix to pc card versions from higher margin parallel port versions 
the increase in net sales was offset partially by a reduction in shipments by the company to its distributors during the fourth quarter of fiscal in order to reduce the levels of inventories held by its distributors and enable the company to quickly react to market changes

in thousands change change gross profit    percentage of net sales gross profit versus gross profit consists of net sales less cost of sales  which includes product costs materials  labor  manufacturing overhead and royalty payments to licensers of software incorporated into the company s products and other costs of sales  including provisions for excess and obsolete inventory and warranty expense 
the increase in gross profit as a percent of net sales in compared to was primarily attributable to a decrease in fixed manufacturing costs as a percentage of sales 
in addition  the realport integrated pc card family of products  which began shipping in the last half of fiscal  has higher gross margins than the comparably featured type ii pc card products 
this increase in the gross profit percentage was partially offset by the increase in modem product sales to the company s oem customers at lower gross profit margins than sales made through the company s distribution partners  and by lower average selling prices on adapter products 
gross profit versus the decrease in gross profit as a percent of net sales in compared to was primarily attributable to lower average selling prices on adapter products  the increased portion of sales represented by pc card products  which have lower gross profit margins than the company s parallel port products  the increased portion of sales made to oem customers  which generally have lower gross profit margins than sales made through the company s distribution partners  and increased inventory reserves charged to cost of sales  related primarily to excess parallel port products 
these negative gross profit impacts were partially offset by increased shipments and the resulting decrease in fixed costs as a percentage of total cost of sales  a change in the discount structure on products sold into the distribution channel beginning in the september quarter  and the favorable impact of cost reduction efforts including the successful transition of all the company s pc card production to its own manufacturing facility in penang  malaysia 
start up expenses related to the malaysian manufacturing facility had a negative impact on gross profit in the first half of fiscal in thousands change change research and development    percentage of net sales research and development expenses increased in in absolute dollars compared to as a result of additional staffing and expenditures to support expanded branded and oem product offerings  including the company s realport integrated pc card family of products 
research and development expenses increased in in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales compared to as a result of additional staffing to support expanded product offerings  offset partially by reduced spending on netwave products 
total expenditures for research and development expenses are expected to increase in as compared to in absolute dollars due to planned expenditures on product enhancements and new product introductions  and may vary as a percentage of sales 
xircom  inc 
in thousands change change sales and marketing    percentage of net sales sales and marketing expenses increased in and decreased as a percentage of sales as compared to the increase in expenses were due to additional staffing and sales and marketing activities required to support expanded branded markets and increased oem sales levels 
partially offsetting these increases were the lower sales and marketing expenditures that generally are associated with oem sales versus branded business sales  reduced expenses associated with lower levels of inventories maintained by distributors  and cooperative advertising reimbursements 
sales and marketing expenses were higher as a percentage of net sales in due to a reduction in shipments by the company to its distributors during the fourth quarter of fiscal in order to reduce the levels of inventories held by its distributors 
sales and marketing expenses increased in from due to additional headcount  marketing activities to support the increased sales levels and expanding markets  and increased distributor related sales and marketing expenses 
as discussed in gross profit above  the company changed its discount structure on products sold into the distribution channel beginning in the september quarter and  as a result  improved its gross profit margins in that quarter 
however  the additional gross profit dollars were applied to product and marketing programs  which increased the amount of sales and marketing expenses 
as further product and market expansion activities are pursued  sales and marketing expenses for fiscal are expected to increase in absolute dollars but may vary as a percentage of sales 
in thousands change change general and administrative    percentage of net sales general and administrative expenses increased in as compared to to support growth in the organization and  to a lesser extent  continued expenditures on information systems hardware and software  including year upgrades 
during  the company initiated modification efforts of computer software issues associated with the year project 
costs of the company s year efforts are expensed as incurred 
general and administrative expenses are expected to increase modestly during fiscal due to the need to support growth in the organization and  to a lesser extent  continued expansion of information systems hardware and software including year upgrades  but may decrease as a percentage of net sales

risk factors competition 
the market for notebook pc card adapters has grown rapidly since the personal computer memory card international association pcmcia introduced a standard form factor for pc card lan adapters in companies in the pc  desktop lan adapter and modem industries with greater name recognition and greater financial resources than xircom  now have a significant presence in the pc card adapter market 
as a result  xircom s net sales and gross profit margins have been and are expected to continue to remain subject to adverse competitive pressure 
actions by xircom s competitors which continue to influence this competitive environment include price reductions  new product introductions  promotional efforts  and changes in the level of channel inventory 
competition is expected to remain intense and the company could experience fluctuations in its market share 
moreover  xircom believes that the market for pc card lan adapters  modems and combo cards will continue to be price competitive and thus could continue to result in lower selling prices  lower gross profit margins and reduced profitability levels than it earned from such products in the past 
manufacturing 
the company believes that its in house manufacturing facility is operating at a greater efficiency level than during prior years 
this manufacturing facility  located in malaysia  began volume production in early fiscal and is now producing all of xircom s products 
while the manufacturing facility and increased production is expected to have a continuing positive impact on cost reduction efforts  xircom may be unable to achieve significant additional efficiencies from this facility 
if xircom is unable to achieve additional cost reductions through increased manufacturing efficiency or through increased production it may be unable to keep pace with competitors cost or price reductions to an extent necessary to maintain or increase market share without adversely affecting gross profit margins 
because all products are being manufactured at its own facility  if xircom is unable to accurately forecast or react to changes in product demand  interruptions in the supply of products could occur which in turn could adversely affect future sales 
xircom also faces risks associated with operations xircom  inc 
overseas  including management of a distant manufacturing facility  currency fluctuations and potential instability in the local country  particularly in light of recent economic and political uncertainty in malaysia and in asia generally 
currency 
all of xircom s international sales are denominated in us dollars and may be subject to government controls and other risks 
these controls and risks may include federal restrictions on export  export licenses  trade restrictions  changes in tariff and freight rates  currency fluctuations  and political instability 
xircom could experience increased credit risks such as customer insolvencies or other impairments of customers ability to repay existing obligations and difficulties in accessing new markets in the region as a result of the recent economic instability  currency fluctuations and other factors impacting international markets and asian markets in particular 
the company has implemented and may continue to implement certain strategies to limit the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on its asian distributors 
in doing so  xircom may assume greater foreign currency risk in the future 
continued instability or other adverse changes in local economies could affect the future operations of the company 
in september  the malaysian government fixed the exchange rate of the malaysian ringgit at ringgits per us dollar 
the company believes that the fixing  or any potential reversion to a floating exchange rate  will not have a significant impact on its results of operations 
several european countries will adopt a single european currency the euro as of january  with a transition period continuing through january  xircom is reviewing the anticipated impact the euro may have on its internal systems and on its competitive environment 
the company believes its internal systems will be euro capable without material modification cost 
further  the company does not presently expect the introduction of the euro currency to have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
product mix 
revenues derived from xircom s combo and modem only pc cards typically have lower gross profit margins than lan pc cards 
in addition  shipments to oems generally result in lower average selling prices and gross profit margins than sales made through the company s distribution partners 
increases in the proportion of modem only and combo pc cards and in shipments to oems have negatively impacted overall gross margins and may continue to offset any improvements from manufacturing and design efficiencies 
this trend may continue as the company anticipates an increased mix of oem revenues as a percentage of sales 
in addition  the increased percentage of revenue from oem customers during fiscal as compared to fiscal has resulted in an increased concentration in the company s customer base 
with this increased customer concentration  the company has increased its dependency on a limited number of customers at lower average selling prices and gross profit margins than sales made through the company s distribution partners 
backlog 
xircom generally ships products within one to four weeks after receipt of orders and therefore its sales backlog is typically minimal 
accordingly  the company s expectations of future net sales are based largely on its own estimate of future demand and not on firm customer orders 
if net sales do not meet expectations  profitability would be adversely affected  as the company may not be able to reduce expenses commensurately in the near term 
channel inventory 
xircom s net sales may be affected by its distributors decisions as to the quantity of the company s products to be maintained in their inventories 
since the fourth quarter of fiscal  xircom has taken steps to reduce the levels of inventories maintained by its distributors and to enable the company to react more quickly to market changes 
as a result  xircom may be more directly affected by changes in the market  including the impact of any slowdown or rapid increase in end user demand 
despite the company s efforts to reduce channel inventory exposure  distributors may still choose to reduce their inventories below the already reduced levels  adversely affecting xircom s net sales 
new product introductions 
xircom s continued success is dependent on its ability to continue to introduce new products offering advanced features  functionality and solutions demanded by end users 
the company xircom  inc 
cannot assure that it will be able to continue to introduce advanced products in a timely manner or that new products it introduces will achieve market acceptance or sell through to end users in sufficient quantities to make them viable for the long term 
sales of such new products may negatively impact sales of xircom s existing products 
in addition  the company may have difficulty in establishing its products presence in markets in which it does not currently have significant brand recognition 
component availability 
because of frequent technology changes and rapid industry growth  the cost and availability of components used to manufacture xircom s products may fluctuate 
because some components  including custom chipsets  are available from only one supplier  they are subject to the risk of reduced availability due to manufacturing constraints  an excess of demand versus supply  national political or economic changes  and other risks not within the company s control 
although the company has not experienced any significant parts shortages over the past year  many of these components require long lead purchase orders and flexibility to change order quantities due to changes in demand is limited 
any supply source interruptions  limitations on availability  or inability to develop alternative sources as needed could affect xircom s ability to deliver its products and  in turn  adversely affect its future earnings 
gross margin 
in summary  gross profit margins are impacted by a number of factors including sales growth rates  competitive pricing pressures  product sales mix  channel sales mix  frequency of product transitions  component cost  and manufacturing cost 
in addition  new products often have lower gross profit margins until market acceptance when increased volumes may permit component cost reductions and manufacturing efficiencies 
technology shifts 
a number of additional factors could have an impact on xircom s future operating results 
rapid technological change and short product life cycles characterize the industry in which xircom operates 
the industry includes competitors with greater financial and technical resources than the company 
while xircom has historically been successful in developing or integrating leading technology into its products  ongoing investment in research and development is required to maintain its technological position 
the company may need to increase the rate of such investment depending on competitive factors 
if networking capability is included in extension modules to pcs or in the pc itself  a reduction in the demand for add on networking devices could result 
xircom s operating results and ability to retain its market share are also dependent on continued growth in the underlying markets for notebook networking products and notebook computers  and the notebook to network connection rate 
intellectual property 
xircom cannot assure that its patents  copyrights  trademarks and other efforts to protect its intellectual property will prevent duplication of its technology or provide a competitive advantage 
the company also cannot assure that any patent issued to it would be upheld as valid if litigation over the patent were initiated 
because of the rapid pace of technological change in the communications industry  and while xircom will aggressively assert its intellectual property rights when necessary  xircom believes its success is likely to depend more upon continued innovation  technical expertise  marketing skills and customer support and service rather than upon legal protection of the company s proprietary rights 
with the proliferation of new products and rapidly changing technology in the pc card market  there is a significant volume of patents or similar intellectual property rights held by third parties 
given the nature of the company s products and development efforts  there are risks that claims associated with such patents or intellectual property rights could be asserted by third parties 
these risks include the cost of licensing a given technology 
if a claimant refuses to offer such a license on terms acceptable to xircom  there is a risk of incurring a substantial cost of litigation or settlement of such claims regardless of the merits of the allegations 
in the event of litigation  if the company does not prevail  it may be required to pay significant damages  and or to cease sales and production of infringing products  and only make future sales of a noninfringing design 
the company currently uses software licensed from third parties in certain of its combo  modem only and token ring products which  in the aggregate  accounted for of revenues during xircom s operating results xircom  inc 
could be adversely affected by a number of factors relating to this third party software 
such factors include failure by a licensor to accurately develop  timely introduce  promote or support the software  resultant delays in shipment of xircom s products  excess customer support costs or product returns experienced by xircom due to errors in licensed software  or termination of xircom s relationship with such licensors 
stock price 
the market price of xircom s common stock has been  and may continue to be  subject to a high degree of volatility 
certain factors may have a significant impact on the market price of the company s common stock 
these factors include general conditions in the networking and computer industries  announcements of quarterly operating results  acquisitions  pricing  new products or technological innovations by the company or its competitors  and other events 
in addition  stock markets have experienced extreme price volatility in recent years 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market price of securities issued by many high technology companies  including xircom  in many cases for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
xircom s common stock has experienced volatility not necessarily related to announcements of company performance 
broad market fluctuations may also affect the market price of xircom s common stock 
year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
such computer programs or hardware may have date sensitive software or embedded chips that always assume the century is 
this could cause miscalculations or failure in the company s information systems and or manufacturing equipment 
such system miscalculations or failure could cause disruptions of operations including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in normal business activities 
disruptions of the company s operations may also occur if key suppliers or customers experience disruptions in their ability to purchase  supply or transact with the company due to year issues 
the company s global operations rely heavily on the infrastructures within the countries in which they do business 
the year readiness within infrastructure suppliers utilities  government agencies  and shipping organizations will be crucial to the company s ability to avoid disruption of its operations 
xircom has reviewed its own products and believes they do not present any year issues 
these products are used as accessories to systems which may contain year issues and the company believes that any such year issues in systems are not to be attributed to the company s products 
the company has completed its initial analysis of the major information systems that could be significantly affected by the year issue and has committed personnel and resources to resolve potential issues 
based on the initial analysis  the company determined that it would be required to modify or replace certain portions of its internal hardware and software so that those systems will properly use dates beyond december  the company presently believes that the year issue can be mitigated with respect to its internal information systems and manufacturing equipment with modifications or replacements of certain existing software and hardware 
the company s plan to resolve the year issue involves four phases assessment  remediation  testing  and contingency planning 
the company s assessment plan for both information technology it and non it systems is currently in process 
a communications plan has been initiated to create awareness  both internally and externally  of the need to identify year issues and the risks the issues create 
inventories of systems  equipment  and processes from xircom s global locations are in the process of being collected and analyzed 
thus far  the assessment has indicated that most of the company s significant it systems are year compliant 
the assessment indicated  however  that the company s customer interaction system could be affected 
this system is currently in the process of being replaced  with completion scheduled for june the company is complete with its remediation phase with respect to its it exposures and expects to complete all software reprogramming or replacement no later than september  upon completion of software reprogramming or replacement for a particular system  the company tests and implements the modifications 
xircom  inc 
awareness and assessment of any year issues relating to operating equipment is complete 
the initial conclusion of this assessment is that the company s operating equipment is year compliant 
the company plans to complete the validation of this preliminary conclusion by march  the company has queried its significant suppliers regarding their year readiness 
to date  the company is not aware of any such supplier with a year issue that would materially affect the company s operating results 
the company has no means of ensuring that such suppliers will be year ready and  accordingly  is planning to perform a secondary evaluation by march  of its critical suppliers to obtain further assurances about their readiness 
the company could be materially impacted if its significant suppliers are unable to complete their year resolution process in a timely fashion 
the ultimate effect of non compliance by these parties is not determinable 
xircom is using both internal and external resources to replace  test and implement software and operating equipment needing year modifications 
the total cost of the year project is estimated at million and is being funded by cash flows from operations 
to date  the company has incurred approximately   expensed and  capitalized for new software  related to all phases of the year project 
of the total remaining project costs  approximately  is attributable to the purchase of new software and hardware  which will be capitalized 
the remaining  will be expensed as incurred 
the company is developing a contingency plan for organizing responses in case of shutdown of certain critical applications due to year issues 
this contingency plan involves  among other things  it and non it systems and external systems 
the company believes that the most likely worst case of a year related failure given its state of readiness today would be a temporary loss of of its internal it capability with no material impact on its ability to conduct normal revenue generating operations 
liquidity and capital resources the company s continuing operating activities provided cash of approximately million in  primarily due to net income and a decrease in working capital requirements 
the decrease in working capital requirements consists of decreases in inventories and income tax receivable and increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and income taxes payable  offset in part by an increase in accounts receivable 
the decrease in inventories and increase in accounts receivable are due to a reduction in shipments by the company to its distributors during the fourth quarter of fiscal in order to reduce the levels of inventories held by its distributors 
investing activities in used million in cash  primarily for capital expenditures 
the capital expenditures primarily related to the purchase of the company s manufacturing facility located in malaysia  manufacturing equipment and improvements at the manufacturing facility  equipment for increased headcount  and information systems hardware and software 
the company has no material fixed commitments for capital expenditures 
the company s financing activities provided million in cash in  primarily from the issuance of common stock through its stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
the company has a credit facility with a bank for borrowings up to million 
loans under the agreement are secured by all us based assets of the company 
the agreement expires in december the company also has a credit facility  denominated in malaysian ringgit  with a bank in malaysia totaling million 
as of september   there were no borrowings outstanding under either agreement 
as of november   the company had approximately million in borrowings available under these credit facilities 
intel corporation holds a warrant to purchase  newly issued shares of xircom s common stock 
the warrant is exercisable at a price of per share through february  and per share from february  through its expiration on february  the company believes that cash on hand  borrowings available under its existing facilities or from other financing sources and cash provided by operations will be sufficient to support its working capital and capital expenditure xircom  inc 
requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurances that future cash requirements to fund operations will not require the company to seek additional capital sooner than the twelve months  or that such additional capital will be available when required on terms acceptable to the company 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments 
xircom maintains a portfolio of highly liquid cash equivalents maturing in three months or less as of the date of purchase 
given the short term nature of these investments  and that the company has no borrowings outstanding  the company is not subject to significant interest rate risk 
a portion of xircom s operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities in foreign locations 
the company manufactures its products in malaysia and sells its products worldwide 
the company s financial results  therefore  could be significantly impacted by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
xircom s operating results are exposed to the impact of weakening economic conditions in the countries in which it sells its products 
since all of xircom s sales are denominated in us dollars  the company s foreign operations are net payers of currencies other than the us dollar  particularly the malaysian ringgit and the belgian franc 
as such  the company s operating results may be adversely affected by the impacts of a stronger malaysian ringgit or belgian franc relative to the us dollar 
to mitigate the short term effect of changes in currency exchange rates on its foreign currency based expenses  the company purchases and holds malaysian ringgits and belgian francs in advance of the due date of their underlying obligations
