the company experienced an overall decline in sales and orders for the company s programming systems division products during orders declined approximately to million in  compared with million in page sales for the programming systems division are expected to continue to experience pressure due primarily to delays in new product introductions by the company 
the company believes that increased competition in the areas where new data i o product introductions are not scheduled to occur until  or where these new products will not be available in production volumes until  or where products are nearing the end of their product life cycles  adversely affected sales in and will continue to do so 
in addition  the declines in non automated programming systems also reflect the continuing market shift away from the company s traditional line of higher price ic programmers for the engineering market  toward lower price programmers 
as a result  the company believes that until its new products are released and shipping in production quantities  overall demand for its programming systems will likely be flat or may decrease in recent changes in programmable ic technology  such as increasingly complex logic ics  lower voltage requirements and higher pin counts  and the increasing need for higher quality and high volume programming by users of programmable ics means that there is a significant market need for more sophisticated programmers with new programming technology and automated programming systems 
the company currently has development projects underway for new programmer and automation technology designed to address the needs perceived by the company to be created by these technology changes 
in addition  the company released four new low cost programming products late in the second quarter  consisting of the chipwriter tm  the chipwriter tm portable  the chipwriter tm gang and the labsite tm programming system 
there can be no assurance that the company will complete development of planned new products as scheduled or that new products will generate significant sales

during international sales were slightly lower as compared to sales decreased in europe  canada and japan  but increased slightly in other parts of the world 
the foreign currency exchange rate changes reduced sales by approximately million during compared to these declines were due primarily to exchange rate changes for the german mark and the japanese yen 
when the us dollar is stronger  sales of the company s products in local currency translate into fewer us dollars 
however  offsetting the revenue translation impact is the translation of local currency costs and expenses 
vs 
the decline in overall automated handling systems sales and orders in was primarily due to a slowdown in capital spending by electronics manufacturing companies 
however  the company believes that increased competition in areas where new data i o product introductions were not scheduled to occur until future periods  or where products are nearing the end of their life cycles  also had a negative affect on sales in the company believes the declines in non automated programming systems also reflect the continuing market shift away from the company s traditional line of higher priced ic programmers for the engineering market  toward lower priced programmers 
this shift has been caused in part by advances in semiconductor processing technology that have lowered the barriers to entry in the programmer business over the last several years 
this has caused new market entrants to appear regularly  each trying to carve out a niche 
new entrants cause downward price pressure  and each cycle of new competitors lowers the acceptable price of a conventional ic programmer in the customer s view 
in addition  the company believes that technological improvements in personal computers and design software tools have caused a shift in the demand for ic design tools by engineering design teams away from hardware tools in favor of increased software design tools 
these industry changes had  and are continuing to have  an adverse effect on the company s ic programmer sales and gross margins  especially because the company s products historically have been oriented toward hardware tools and  within hardware tools  toward higher priced ic programmers 
the company experienced a small decrease in international sales during due to lower sales in europe due to the slowdown in capital spending by electronics manufacturing companies and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes  which were partially offset by increased sales in asia 
the foreign currency exchange rate changes reduced sales by approximately million during compared to these declines were due primarily to rate changes for the german mark and the japanese yen 
when the us dollar is stronger  sales of the company s products in local currency translate into fewer us dollars 
however  offsetting the revenue translation impact is the translation of local currency costs and expenses 
page gross margin in thousands change change gross margin    percentage of net sales vs 
the gross margin increased in dollars and as a percentage of sales during compared to the increase in gross margin is due primarily to less inventory reserves recorded in  offset by lower volumes and lower product margins in the relatively high fixed component of cost of goods sold causes any shift in total volume to have a significant impact on gross margin 
the shift in mix of product revenues from higher priced and higher margin non automated programming systems to the lower priced alternatives has lowered the overall product gross margins 
also contributing to the decline of gross margin was the strengthening of the us dollar in relation to the japanese yen and the german mark  in which approximately of the company s sales were denominated 
vs 
the gross margin decreased in dollars and as a percentage of sales during compared to the decrease in gross margin was due primarily to lower volumes  lower product margins and increases in inventory reserves in the shift in mix of product revenues from higher priced and higher margin non automated programming systems to the lower priced alternatives also lowered the overall product gross margins 
also contributing to the decline of gross margin was the strengthening of the us dollar in relation to the japanese yen and the german mark  in which approximately of the company s sales were denominated 
research and development in thousands change change research and development    percentage of net sales vs 
research and development spending decreased in amount but increased as a percentage of sales in compared to the spending decrease is primarily due to reduced spending on materials related to development projects and open job positions 
the increase as a percentage of sales is due to lower sales volume 
the company expects to continue its significant investment in research and development  especially for projects related to planned product introductions 
the company believes it is essential to invest in research and development to support its existing products and to create new products as markets develop and technologies change 
the company is focusing its research and development efforts in its strategic growth markets  namely new programming technology and automated handling systems for the manufacturing environment 
the company expects to continue this focus in the future and believes that it is essential to invest in research and development to support its existing products and to create new products as markets develop and technologies change 
vs 
research spending increased both in dollars and as a percentage of sales 
the increase was primarily due to additional product development projects  including those related to products introduced in  and additional engineering staff compensation costs 
page selling  general and administrative in thousands change change selling  general and administrative    percentage of net sales vs 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses during as compared to is primarily due to decreased costs related to the closure of the uk office  decreased travel costs and decreased dollar costs in the company s foreign offices due to the strengthened us dollar  offset by increased commissions due to an increased number of sales representatives in the us and canada 
vs 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenditures during relative to was primarily due to decreased commissions  incentive compensation and decreased expenses in the company s foreign offices  due in part to currency rate changes 
interest in thousands change change interest income interest expense vs

income taxes in thousands income tax expense effective tax rate vs 
the effective income tax rate for differed from the expected provision at the statutory tax rate primarily due to the reversal of tax valuation reserves 
the adjustments to the valuation reserves were due to an ability to record a benefit for the offset of reversing temporary differences against taxable income 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company had valuation allowances of  at december  compared to  at december  and  at december  the valuation reserves may increase should the company incur future losses or reverse as the company recognizes income 
page vs 
the effective income tax rate for differed from the expected provision at the statutory tax rate primarily due to the addition of tax valuation reserves 
the increase in valuation reserves was due to an inability to record a benefit for foreign tax credit carryforwards and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards as well as the reduced ability to offset reversing temporary differences against taxable income after carrying back the tax loss 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements

page discontinued operations semiconductor equipment division in november  the company sold the assets of its semiconductor equipment division  reel tech tm inc  to general scanning inc  for million  consisting of million in cash  million in common stock of general scanning inc and million in assumed liabilities 
the assets of reel tech  inc were purchased by the company in august operating results of the semiconductor equipment division and the gain on the sale of this segment are as follows in thousands net sales   income loss from operations before income taxes income tax expense income loss from operations gain on disposal before income taxes  income tax expense  gain on disposal  total income loss on discontinued segment  excludes inter segment sales to the programming systems division of  and  in and  respectively 
synario r design automation division also in november  the company entered into a licensing agreement and an agreement to sell certain assets of its synario design automation division 
under this licensing agreement  the company s electronic design automation eda products are being integrated and sold with the eda product line of minc incorporated 
this transaction discontinues the synario design automation division operations of the company 
however  the company is entitled to receive and may realize certain licensing revenues related to its abel and ecs products through december  also  the company negotiated a settlement to the oem agreement with synopsys inc  which is reflected in the loss on disposal 
operating results and the loss on the disposal of this segment are as follows in thousands net sales    loss from operations before income taxes    income tax benefit loss from operations    loss on disposal before income taxes  income tax benefit loss on disposal total loss on discontinued segment    includes net sales of  for retained licensing rights recognized after the disposition in inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates historically  the company has been able to offset the impact of inflation through efficiency increases and price adjustments 
increasing price competition  especially in ic programmers  is currently diminishing and may continue to diminish the company s ability to offset the impacts of inflation in the future 
sales and expenses incurred by foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the subsidiary s local currency and translated into us dollar amounts at average rates of exchange during the year 
to date the foreign currency rate changes have not significantly impacted the company s profitability 
this is because approximately of the company s sales are made by foreign subsidiaries and independent currency fluctuations tend to minimize the translation effect of any individual currency exchange fluctuations  and the page effect of individual rate changes on sales and expenses tend to offset each other 
additionally  the company hedges its foreign currency exposure on sales of inventory and certain loans to its foreign subsidiaries through the use of foreign exchange contracts

financial condition liquidity and capital resources in thousands change change working capital      total debt    working capital increased significantly during primarily due to funds received from the sale of the company s semiconductor equipment division see discontinued operations and the sale of the corporate headquarters property see sale of headquarters property 
the company s trade accounts receivable related to continuing operations decreased by approximately million during primarily due to more successful collections toward year end and decreased sales volume in the company increased its inventory level by  during  primarily due to the promaster beta units in inventory at year end other current assets increased million in primarily due to accounts receivable related to the reel tech and synario design automation divisions which were not sold as a part of the disposals of these divisions in november accounts payable and accrued expenses increased by million primarily due to accrual of additional contingent payments related to the acquisition of reel tech  accrued incentive compensation  income taxes payable  and accrued employee separation and relocation costs and remaining accounts payable and accruals related to the disposed business segments 
as of december   the company had total debt of million or approximately of its million in equity 
of this current debt  million was for the balance of the purchase price of the cad cam group that was paid in january and the balance was borrowings on its foreign line of credit 
at december   the company also had an unused million us line of credit maturing in may under which borrowings would incur interest at the bank s published prime rate or the libor rate plus basis points 
the foreign line of credit of million matures in august historically  this debt and the us line of credit  have been structured as short term and have been renewed on their maturity dates 
the company expects to be able to renew these lines of credit on maturity under substantially the same terms as those presently in place 
no assurances can be made  however  in regard to the renewal of these agreements 
the company estimates that capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment during will be approximately million 
such expenditures are expected to be funded from internally generated funds and  if necessary  borrowings from the company s existing credit lines 
although the company fully expects that such expenditures will be made  it has commitments for only a small portion of these amounts 
at december   the company s material short term unused sources of liquidity consisted of approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and available borrowings of million under its us line of credit and approximately  under its foreign line of credit 
the company believes these sources and cash flow from operations will be sufficient during to fund working capital needs  service existing debt and finance planned capital acquisitions 
share repurchase program the company announced on october  a share repurchase program which authorized the company to repurchase up to approximately  shares of its outstanding shares of common stock 
on february  and may  the company announced an extension of the share repurchase program which authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional approximately  shares and approximately up to  shares respectively of its outstanding common stock 
these purchases may be executed through open market purchases at prevailing market prices  page through block purchases or in privately negotiated transactions 
purchases may commence or be discontinued at any time 
as of december   the company had repurchased  shares at a total cost of approximately million 
general impact of year some of the company s older computer programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  those computer programs have time sensitive software that recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could cause a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has completed an assessment of its data processing systems and will have to modify or replace portions of its software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the total year project cost is estimated at approximately million  which includes approximately  for new hardware that will be capitalized and approximately  that will be expensed as incurred 
as of december   the company had incurred and expensed approximately  related to this project 
the company believes that the project should be completed by june   which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
the company believes  based on its current understanding of its systems  that with modifications to the existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue should not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not properly made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the cost of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  cooperation of vendors and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in the area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties
