the company s products and key financial and operational systems are being reviewed and  where required  detailed plans are being developed and will be implemented on a schedule intended to permit the company s computer systems and products to continue to function properly 
the year date conversion effort is expected to increase costs in and while final cost estimates are not complete  management does not expect these costs will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows

management continues to assess these risks in order to reduce the impact on the company 
inflation inflation has not had a material impact upon operating results  and the company does not expect it to have such an impact in the near future 
there can be no assurances  however  that the company s business will not be so affected by inflation
