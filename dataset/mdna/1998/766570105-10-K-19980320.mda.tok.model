liquidity sensitivity to market risk the corporation is exposed to various market risks 
it has determined that interest rate risk has a material impact on the corporation s financial performance  and as such has established the asset liability committee alco to manage interest rate risk 
the role of this committee is to prudently manage the asset liability mix of the corporation to provide a stable net interest margin while maintaining liquidity and capital 
this entails the management of the overall risk of the corporation in conjunction with the acquisition and deployment of funds based upon the committee s view of both current and prospective market and economic conditions 
the corporation manages its interest rate risk through the use of an income simulation model  which forecasts the impact on net interest income of a variety of different interest rate scenarios 
a most likely interest rate scenario is forecasted based upon an analysis of current market conditions and expectations 
the model then evaluates the impact on net interest income of rates moving significantly higher or lower than the most likely scenario 
the results are compared to risk tolerance limits set by corporate policy 
the model s results as of december  are shown in table m 
current policy establishes limits for possible changes in net interest income for and month horizons 
the interest rate scenarios monitored by alco are based upon a basis point gradual increase or decrease in rates versus the most likely scenario over a month time period and a basis point gradual increase or decrease in rates versus the most likely scenario over a month time period 
at year end  the forecasted impact of rates rising or falling basis points versus the most likely scenario over a month time period was a change in net interest income not exceeding 
for a basis point movement in rates versus the most likely scenario over a month period  the impact on net interest income did not exceed 
the results of the simulation for year end indicated that the corporation maintained an asset sensitive position  and was well insulated against interest rates moving significantly in either direction 
in managing the corporation s interest rate risk  alco uses financial derivative instruments  such as interest rate swaps  caps  floors  collars  futures  and options 
financial derivatives are employed to assist in the management and or reduction of the interest rate risk of the corporation  and can effectively alter the sensitivity of segments of the statement of condition for specified periods of time 
all of these instruments are considered off balance sheet  as they do not materially affect the level of assets or liabilities of the corporation 
interest rate risk management strategies are discussed and approved by alco prior to implementation 
management finds that the methodologies discussed above provide a meaningful representation of the corporation s interest rate and market risk sensitivity  though factors other than changes in the interest rate environment  such as levels of non earning assets  and changes in the composition of earning assets  may affect net interest income 
management believes its current interest rate sensitivity level is appropriate  considering the corporation s economic outlook and conservative approach taken in the review and monitoring of the corporation s sensitivity position 
capital resources a fundamental objective of management is to maintain a level of capitalization that is sufficient to take advantage of favorable investment opportunities and to promote depositor and investor confidence 
in addition  the current economic and regulatory climate places an increased emphasis on capital strength and the ability of the corporation to withstand unfavorable economic and or business losses 
the corporation s management monitors its capital levels monthly in relation to financial forecasts for the year  as well as internal and external policies 
the corporation continues to maintain a strong capital position  and is one of the highest capitalized banks in the country

the federal reserve board has issued risk based capital guidelines for bank holding companies 
the guidelines define a two tier capital framework 
tier i capital consists of common and qualifying preferred stockholders equity along with qualifying trust preferred securities  less goodwill and other adjustments 
tier ii capital consists of mandatory convertible  subordinated and other qualifying term debt  preferred stock and trust preferred securities not qualifying as tier i capital and the reserve for loan losses up to percent of risk weighted assets 
under these guidelines  one of four risk weightings is assigned to the different on balance sheet assets 
off balance sheet items  such as loan commitments and derivatives  are also assigned a risk weighting after conversion to balance sheet equivalent amounts 
bank holding companies are required to meet a minimum ratio of qualifying total combined tier i and tier ii capital to risk weighted assets of  at least half of which must be composed of core tier i capital elements 
the corporation s total and core capital ratios were and  respectively  at december   compared with and  respectively  at december  the corporation s total and core capital ratios have been enhanced by the inclusion of the proceeds from the trust preferred securities see note common and preferred stock 
the federal reserve board has established an additional capital adequacy guideline  the leverage ratio  in keeping with the prompt corrective action regulations promulgated under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia which measures the ratio of tier i capital to quarterly average assets 
the minimum leverage ratio guideline is for the most highly rated bank holding companies 
those that are not in the most highly rated category  including the corporation  must maintain at least a minimum ratio of or higher  if determined necessary by the federal reserve board through its assessment of the corporation s asset quality  earnings performance  interest rate risk and liquidity 
the corporation s leverage ratio was at december   compared with a leverage ratio of at the prior year end 
the corporation s policy is to ensure that its bank subsidiary is capitalized in accordance with regulatory guidelines 
the corporation s national bank subsidiary is subject to minimum capital ratios as prescribed by the office of the comptroller of the currency the occ  which are the same as those prescribed by the federal reserve board for bank holding companies 
table n details the actual and required minimum ratios for the corporation and its insured bank subsidiary

additionally  increases in salaries and wages of million occurred  due in part to staff additions during the year 
these increases were partially offset by lower benefits costs million attributable to reductions in medical and life insurance funding  and a net position for other real estate owned costs resulting in income of million versus expense of thousand in the prior year see table r 
year the arrival of the next millennium presents challenges for all companies 
financial institutions are dependent on information systems and have many internal and external interdependencies with other financial institutions and companies 
these interdependencies will affect the amount of work needed to be performed to achieve year compliance

additionally  management evaluated the issues associated with the year and determined that an enterprise wide business risk assessment approach is most appropriate for addressing and remediating year problems 
the enterprise wide business risk assessment approach includes identifying significant business segments within the organization  identifying significant participants within those segments such as customers  vendors  suppliers  and systems  and assessing the year preparedness of each 
further  for the systems  both those supported in house and those provided by vendors  it involves identifying where the year has an impact  remediating those areas and performing integrated testing of program changes 
the corporation s progress towards completing the enterprise wide business risk assessment is on target 
management plans to complete remediation of all critical systems by december   in accordance with federal regulatory agency guidelines 
testing of systems changes will be performed throughout management has assessed the cost of remediating the corporation s systems and does not expect these costs to have a material impact on the corporation s business  operations  or financial condition
