item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides information on the results of operations for each of the three years ended december  and the financial condition  liquidity and capital resources as of december  the financial statements and the notes thereto contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with this discussion 
the profitability of the company s operations in any particular accounting period will be directly related to the average realized prices of oil and gas sold  the type and volume of oil and gas produced and the results of acquisition  development  exploitation and exploration activities 
the average realized prices for oil and gas will fluctuate from one period to another due to world and regional market conditions and other factors 
the aggregate amount of oil and gas produced may fluctuate based on the success of development and exploitation of oil and gas reserves pursuant to current reservoir management 
production rates  steam costs  labor  maintenance expenses and production taxes are expected to be the principal influences on operating costs 
accordingly  the results of operations of the company may fluctuate from period to period based on the foregoing principal factors  among others 
results of operations net income for was million  up  or million  from million in and  or million  from million in for the fourth quarter of  net income was million  down from million in the fourth quarter of  but up from million in the fourth quarter of although production on the company s core assets has continued to increase  profitability decreased from the third quarter of due to lower oil prices and higher operating costs 
the following table presents certain operating data for the years ended december   and for comparative purposes net production boe per day    per boe average sales price operating costs production taxes total operating costs dd a g a excluding production taxes 
operating income from producing operations was million in  up million from million in and up million from million in the improvement from was primarily due to higher production volumes  partially offset by both higher dd a and production taxes  and lower oil prices 
the average sales price boe received of in was lower than the received in  but higher than the received in recently  worldwide oil prices have declined sharply with average postings for midway sunset field crude oil at per barrel as of march  oil and gas production was  boe day  up from  boe day in and up from  boe day in the increase in production was due primarily to the drilling and development program and increased steam volumes related to the properties acquired in the fourth quarter of total production from the formax and tannehill properties purchased in the fourth quarter of has increased to approximately  boe day at the end of from approximately  boe day upon acquisition 
the company has a hedge contract for  b d of the company s crude production with a california refiner to help protect the company s revenue from declines in the price of crude oil 
the current contract was initiated in february and expires on august  the current price of california heavy crude oil is considerably under the lower threshold of the contract  therefore  the company anticipates that its revenues per barrel will be beneficially impacted under the terms of the contract  if the low price levels continue 
operating costs per boe in of were equal to in and lower than in the formax properties were produced by our predecessor at reservoir temperatures below the temperature conditions on the company s adjacent properties 
to improve production levels  the company provided additional heat to the reservoir by firing several conventional generators in addition to its cogeneration facilities to increase the volume of injected steam 
however  the cost of conventionally generated steam is more expensive than the steam produced by the company s two cogeneration plants 
therefore  the cost of steam and the volume injected increased in compared to on a per barrel basis  the company more than offset this increased steam cost by reducing other lifting costs 
production taxes per boe have increased  or  in compared to due primarily to the acquisitions and significantly higher pricing assumptions used by kern county to calculate the property taxes 
the company expects lower production taxes in  in both real terms and on a boe basis  primarily due to the current low oil price environment and higher anticipated production 
although total operating costs increased  operating costs boe were equal to the level due to higher production volumes in the company anticipates that its operating cost per boe will trend lower in due to increased production  lower production taxes and continuing operating cost efficiencies 
dd a per boe increased to in  up from and in and  respectively 
the increase was due primarily to the property acquisitions and increased drilling activity in and the company expects that its dd a cost per boe will stay relatively flat to slightly higher in in  the company completed the sale of its california san joaquin valley eastside non core properties located in the poso creek and kern front fields and certain non operated interests in louisiana for a total of million 
the company disposed of these properties due to limited exploitation potential and high operating costs 
in the fourth quarter of  the company acquired the producing properties of tannehill oil company and formax oil company  which are adjacent to the company s core south midway sunset properties 
at the time of the acquisitions  the properties produced approximately  barrels per day of degree api gravity crude oil 
as of december   production from these properties had increased to approximately  b d  exceeding the company s stated goal of  b d 
general interest and dividend income in was 
million  down from million and million in and  respectively 
in addition  interest expense for was million  up significantly from 
million in and in the company did not capitalize any interest in or these fluctuations were due to the use of cash and debt to finance the acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of total debt at december  was million  comprised of long term debt of million and a short term note payable of million 
however  by the end of  total debt was million  all long term  for a total reduction of million  or 
the company expects long term debt to decrease further in unless additional capital is needed for an acquisition and or the price of crude oil remains low 
g a was million in  up and  from million in and million in  respectively 
however  on a boe basis  g a decreased to from in both and two factors that increased g a costs in were higher non cash compensation related to the exercising of stock options and the writeoff of failed acquisition expenses 
these two items accounted for 
million 
the company anticipates that its total g a costs will not exceed its costs and will continue to decrease on a per boe basis 
the company s effective income tax rate in was  down from and in and  respectively 
the lower rate in was due to additional federal and state tax credits generated from increased investment in qualified enhanced oil recovery projects 
the company expects that its effective rate would decrease significantly in a continuing low oil price environment 
in december  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 earnings per share 
as required by this new standard  the company reports two earnings per share amounts  basic net income per share and diluted net income per share 
basic net income per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders the numerator by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding the denominator 
the computation of diluted net income per share is similar to the computation of basic net income per share except that the denominator is increased to include the dilutive effect of the additional common shares that would have been outstanding if all convertible securities had been converted to common shares during the period 
also  during the company adopted the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  environmental remediation liabilities and sfas no 
 accounting for transfer and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
the adoption of these two pronouncements had no material impact on the financial statements of the company 
during  the company implemented the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement sets forth alternative standards for recognition of the cost of stock based compensation and requires that a company s financial statements include certain disclosures about stock based employee compensation arrangements regardless of the method used to account for them 
as allowed in this statement  the company continues to apply accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in recording compensation related to its plans 
the supplemental disclosure requirements and further information related to the company s stock option plans are presented in note to the company s financial statements 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources working capital as of december  was million  up from million at december   but down from million at december  cash flow from operations in increased to a record million  up and from million and million in and  respectively 
cash flow increased in from due primarily to higher production  offset partially by lower oil prices 
working capital increased in primarily because internally generated cash flow was more than sufficient to pay million in capital expenditures  million in dividends and retire million in debt  million of which was short term notes payable 
the company drilled and completed new wells in  reworked an additional wells and made several improvements and additions to surface facilities on the company s core properties 
on december   the company established a million unsecured three year revolving credit facility with nationsbank of texas 
as of december   the borrowing base was million  but was reduced to million on january  the company is carrying million in long term debt under this credit facility as of february  the total proved reserves at december  were million boe  down from million boe at december  and up from million boe at december  after production of million boe  the company s proved reserves increased million boe  or  of production 
the increase in was primarily related to the acquisition of tannehill and formax in the fourth quarter of the company s present value of estimated future net cash flows before income taxes  discounted at  was million at december   down from million at december   but up from million at december  these values were determined based on year end oil prices of  and per boe for  and  respectively 
future developments in december  worldwide crude oil prices began to decline sharply and  as of march   the current average posting for the company s degree api gravity crude oil is per barrel 
in response  the company will defer a minimum of of its original million capital program until at least the latter part of or until crude prices recover 
in addition  certain operating costs have been reduced  such as steam  contractor services and overhead in response to the current pricing situation 
also  in mid march the company is instituting a across the board salary cut with certain members of management taking a larger percentage reduction 
deregulation of the electricity generation market in california may have a positive or negative impact on the company s future steam costs as electricity prices somewhat de couple from natural gas prices 
currently  the company s electricity price received for sales from the two cogeneration plants owned by the company correlates directly with natural gas prices 
therefore  our net steam costs are fairly consistent between quarters and years 
in the future  electricity prices will be determined by not only the cost of natural gas  but also the cost of coal  hydroelectric  nuclear and other sources of fuel 
in addition  power consumption demand may make electricity prices more volatile than in the past 
the company has performed a review of its computer systems and software to determine what steps must be taken to ensure the company can handle transactions in the year and beyond 
to handle this year issue  the company will be replacing all of its accounting software in and expects this project to be completed in a timely manner for a total cost of approximately 
million 
the company is assessing all other company systems to verify that they are year compliant 
in  the company will adopt sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income 
management does not believe that adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the financial statements of the company 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the company has not been significant in recent years because of the relatively low rates of inflation experienced in the united states 
forward looking statements safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of with the exception of historical information  the matters discussed in this form k are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
although the company believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions  it can give no assurance that its goals will be achieved 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements herein include  but are not limited to  the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices for oil and gas  environmental risks  drilling and operating risks  uncertainties about the estimates of reserves and government regulation
