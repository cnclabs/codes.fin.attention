in general  the company s net sales have increased primarily from higher volumes of product shipments and a broader product line due to both internal growth and acquisitions rather than from increases in product prices 
increases in the number of audiologists and hearing device dispensers selling the company s hearing instruments have contributed to the higher volume of shipments

sales the company recognizes revenue upon shipment of products 
net sales consist of gross sales less discounts and allowances for estimated returns 
in general  the company has a day return policy for sales in the united states 
the company believes that the hearing device industry in the us is characterized by a relatively high rate of returns due to a number of factors  including liberal consumer trial periods required by law in many states 
however  the company s return rates in the us are within the range it believes are experienced by other programmable hearing device manufacturers 
in  and  the provision for estimated sales returns in the us  expressed as a percentage of domestic sales  has been  and  respectively 
because of the need to provide a return policy competitive with industry practice in the us and because of the importance of the initial fitting process  the company expects sales returns will continue at a relatively high rate 
in europe and asia  returns are not material due in part to the much higher proportion of standard bte sales versus custom product sales than in the us along with regional retail chain and dispenser practices 
costs and expenses cost of sales consists of manufacturing costs  royalty expenses  quality assurance costs and costs and accruals associated with warranty repairs and product remakes 
in  cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to from in primarily due to the inclusion of special charges of million relating to a comprehensive program to streamline operations and control costs as further described below 
the company provides for estimated warranty cost at the time of sale and adjusts these estimates based on subsequent experience 
the period over which warranty claims may be made in the us is one to two years for electronic components and months for the custom shell used for ite  itc and cic devices 
in  and  the approximate provisions for estimated warranty cost and as a percentage of net sales domestically were million  million  and million  respectively 
the period over which warranty claims may be made in europe and asia is months  and the amount of these claims has been of lesser significance 
the company experiences a high rate of warranty claims related to damage and blockage of the speaker caused by moisture and accumulated ear wax 
the company expects such claims to continue to be significant and expects warranty costs for the current hearing device product line to continue to represent a significant component of cost of sales 
in the second half of  the company recorded special charges of million associated with the company s strategic restructuring program 
this program is designed to streamline operations and control costs through management restructuring  operations consolidations  and increased focus on core activities and product lines 
the special charges provided for costs associated with employee termination benefits for approximately employees from varying subsidiary locations  lease termination costs  the write down of goodwill associated with the acquired hearing health business activity of m  the incremental impairments in the carrying value of certain product inventories  and losses on supplier commitments arising directly from the decision to exit product lines  as follows in thousands employee termination benefits and lease termination costs  write down of shh goodwill  write down of inventories to net realizable value and losses on supplier commitments  write down of capital assets to fair value other exit costs  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to million of special charges  as described above

these increases were partially offset by intensified competition in the programmable segment of the hearing device market from digital signal processing product offerings  pricing pressures from competitors analog products  a product mix shift to more moderately priced models  and decreased international sales 
further  the viennatone subsidiary experienced increased competition and pricing pressures which resulted in an increase in price and unit volume erosion during the total number of audiologists and hearing device retailers increased in the us from  at the end of to  at the end of the number of acousticians and hearing device dispensers selling the company s products internationally was  at the end of international sales for the twelve months ended december  were lower in comparison with last year due primarily to the adverse impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations

selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to million of net sales in from million of net sales in this year to year increase in expenditures resulted mainly from the inclusion of a full year of shh expenses  and special charges of million relating to a strategic program to streamline operations and control costs 
the company expects expenses generally to continue at comparable levels  excluding the special charges  but to fluctuate as a percentage of sales 
as discussed above  the company is undertaking programs to increase operational efficiency and effectiveness in order to reduce expenses  but no assurance can be given that reductions will be obtained  especially when measured on a percentage of sales basis which may vary substantially on a quarter to quarter basis

at december   the company had available cash and cash equivalents of million 
while the company believes that available cash will be sufficient to meet the company s short term operating and capital requirements through december   the company may be required to raise additional capital for its currently envisaged long term needs and in connection with any future acquisitions 
factors that may affect future operating results competition  especially from new digital products  is expected to increase 
the company s ability to grow and achieve profitability will depend upon its ability to develop or otherwise acquire and effectively market competitive dsp and other products 
there can be no assurance that the company can develop and introduce these products in a timely manner  or that these products will be able to compete effectively against current or new competing products 
the development or acquisition of new products is always subject to technological risks and uncertainties which could cause termination of the development of the product or termination of or delay in the introduction of the product  or which could significantly decrease the originally anticipated level of customer acceptance of the product 
also  there can be no assurance that a new product can be manufactured on a cost effective bases  that regulatory approvals  where necessary  can be obtained  or that the expected level of customer acceptance will be met 
in addition  announcements of new products may cause hearing care professionals or hearing impaired persons to defer purchases of existing products or return previously purchased products 
the company s failure to introduce competitive products in a timely manner would have a material  adverse impact on the company s financial condition 
see business competition for a discussion of the competitive environment 
during the past year  the company initiated a major restructuring program 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to implement this program in a timely manner  consolidate targeted operations successfully  or otherwise achieve the cost reductions and other restructuring benefits anticipated 
due to weak economic conditions in certain countries in europe and elsewhere  including germany  austria and france  governments in those countries have reduced and or are under increasing pressure to reduce the government reimbursement levels available to consumers upon their purchases of hearing devices 
recent reductions in reimbursement levels have had a negative impact on the company s revenues in the affected markets 
any future reimbursement reductions can also be anticipated to have a negative impact on the company s revenues 
the company cannot predict whether or the extent to which further reimbursement reductions will be implemented 
similarly  it can be expected that the company s sales results in europe will continue to be adversely impacted if the appreciation of the u 
s 
dollar versus european currencies experienced in continues 
a much publicized dispute in germany between ear  nose and throat professionals who prescribe hearing devices and acousticians who dispense them  negatively impacted the overall hearing health care market 
consumer demand for hearing devices in the fourth quarter of in the german market was down substantially from the fourth quarter of  and sales of the company s products have correspondingly been unfavorably impacted 
the company cannot predict how long and the extent to which its sales in germany will continue to be negatively impacted by this dispute 
the company is subject to regulations by the fda and numerous other federal  state  local and international laws and regulations involving  among other matters  the development  production and marketing of its products  safe working conditions  manufacturing practices  and environmental protection 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory statutes and regulations can result in fines  suspensions  delays in marketing or loss of permission to market products  seizures or recalls of products  operating restrictions  injunctions  civil fines and criminal prosecution 
also  new regulatory requirements may significantly increase the costs of compliance with these laws and regulations 
see business government regulation for a description of these laws and regulations 
the company has been issued or has applied for a substantial number of patents 
no assurance can be given that pending patent applications will be approved  that current or future patents will provide or continue to provide competitive advantages for the company s products  will not be challenged or circumvented  or will afford the same degree of protection for future products as they do for current products 
also  the company may be contacted by parties claiming that the company s products infringe such parties patent or other proprietary rights 
the company may also find it necessary to institute litigation to enforce patents issued to it  to protect trade secrets or know how owned by it or to determine the scope and validity of the patents or other proprietary rights of others 
resolution of these claims generally involves complex legal and factual questions and is highly uncertain 
the cost of prosecuting or defending these suits is high  and adverse determinations could subject the company to significant liabilities to third parties and require the company to seek licenses from other parties  prevent the company from manufacturing and selling its products  and or require the company to redesign its products  all of which could have a materially adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
also  there can be no assurance that confidentiality agreements between the company and its employees or consultants will not be breached  or that the company will have adequate remedies for any breach  or that it will otherwise be able to protect its trade secrets 
furthermore  no assurance can be given that competitors will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary technology or disclose such technology  or that the company can meaningfully protect its rights in such unpatented proprietary technology 
see business patents  trade secrets and licenses for a discussion of the company s patents and other intellectual property 
during the last year  the company experienced various changes in its management and technical staff 
competition for employees with technical  management and other skills is intense 
the company s failure to retain the services of key personnel or to attract additional qualified employees could materially and adversely affect the company s business 
certain key components used in the company s products are currently available only from single or limited sources 
the company s inability to obtain sufficient sole source or limited source components or subassemblies as required  or to develop alternative sources if and as required  would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
other factors which could impact the company s revenues and results of operations include a significant reduction in product sales to certain customers  economic downturns in certain markets  and the costs incurred to expand distribution in europe and asia 
in connection with the company s international sales  a number of risks are inherent in international transactions 
fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies could increase the sales price of the company s products in international markets where the prices of the company s products are denominated in us dollars or lead to currency exchange losses where the prices of the company s products are denominated in local currencies 
international sales and operations may also be limited or disrupted by the imposition of governmental controls  regulation of medical devices  export license requirements  political instability  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs  and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 
the company has determined that it will need to modify or replace significant portions of its software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and beyond 
all required software modifications and replacements are expected to be completed not later than march   which is prior to the occurrence of any year issues 
while the company believes its planning efforts are adequate to address its year concerns  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems and operations rely will be converted on a timely basis and will not have a material effect on the company 
the cost of the year initiatives is not expected to be material to the company s results of operations or financial position 
the market price of the company s common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations 
these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to the company  such as quarterly fluctuations in the company s financial results  changes in analysts estimates of future results  litigation and regulatory developments  changes in investors perceptions of the company or the announcement of new or enhanced products by the company or its competitors 
in addition  such fluctuations may be due to or exacerbated by general conditions in the medical device industry or conditions in the financial markets generally
