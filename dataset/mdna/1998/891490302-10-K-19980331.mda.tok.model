on march   tosco acquired union oil company of california s unocal west coast petroleum refining  marketing  and related supply and transportation assets the products acquisition 
during the balance of  this acquisition  tosco s largest to date  was successfully integrated into tosco s organization 
acquisitions products the products acquisition purchase price including environmental and other liabilities assumed was approximately billion  plus inventories valued at million and credit card receivables valued at million 
in addition  unocal is entitled to receive contingent participation payments over the next seven years if gasoline margins increase above specified levels 
the assets acquired from unocal are comprised of two petroleum refining systems  a retail gasoline system consisting of branded gasoline service stations  a distribution system comprised of company owned oil storage terminals  rights with respect to  miles of crude oil and product pipelines  the world wide rights to the and union brands  and unocal s lubricants manufacturing  distribution  and marketing business

compared to tosco earned record net income of million per share in compared to million per share in results of operations for include a million million after tax  per share non cash inventory writedown as a result of higher levels of inventories from the products acquisition and the start up of the trainer refinery combined with declining raw material and product prices in late results of operations for include a pre tax charge of million million after tax  per share for the consolidation of the retail marketing division following the acquisition of circle k 
operating contribution sales less cost of sales was million in compared to million in  an increase of million  million for refining and million for marketing 
refining operating contribution for increased by million to million due primarily to increased production  barrels per day b d in compared to  b d in 
this increase was due to the acquisition of the product refineries and the start up of the trainer refinery  partially offset by reduced production at the avon refinery during the first and second quarters and an unscheduled shutdown of the bayway refinery cat cracker in the first quarter 
lower production at the avon refinery was due to the scheduled turnaround of the coker unit and the unscheduled hydrocracker shutdown 
the refining operating contribution per barrel  which fluctuated significantly during the year  averaged  consistent with the average 
refinery operating contribution for includes insurance recovery accruals related to the avon hydrocracker and the bayway cat cracker 
retail operating contribution for increased by million to million primarily due to the products and circle k acquisitions and higher blended fuel margins 
the volume of fuel sales approximately doubled to billion gallons and the blended fuel margin increased by cents per gallon  despite a higher proportion of dealer jobber sales resulting from the products acquisition 
fuel margins at dealer jobber sites are typically lower than company operated sites 
the increase in blended fuel margins occurred in the fourth quarter due to declining wholesale product prices without a corresponding decline in retail prices 
the retail operating contribution also increased in due to increased merchandise sales billion in compared to billion in with reasonably consistent margins 
selling  general  and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in the increase of million was primarily attributable to the products and circle k acquisitions  including nonrecurring transition expenses of million related to the integration of products into tosco s operations 
incentive compensation also increased in due to higher levels of operating income 
net interest expense for increased by million compared to this increase is primarily due to higher debt levels incurred to finance tosco s expanded operations and acquisitions 
income taxes  including the benefit associated with the distributions on company obligated  mandatorily redeemable  convertible preferred securities trust preferred securities  were million for compared to million in the increase was due to higher taxable income in the effective income tax rate also reflects the effect of the nondeductibility of amortization of certain intangible assets acquired in the circle k acquisition 
compared to tosco earned million in per share compared to million in per share 
results of operations for include a pre tax charge of million million after tax  per share for the consolidation of the retail marketing division following the acquisition of circle k 
results of operations for include a restructuring charge of million 
operating contribution sales less cost of sales was million in compared to million in  an increase of million due to improved refinery operations million and expanded retail operations million 
refinery operating contribution increased by million to million for due to improved refining margins  partially offset by higher refinery operating costs and lower production volumes 
refining operating contribution per barrel  which fluctuated significantly during the year  averaged for the year  an improvement of from operating contribution for benefited from the strong east coast refining margins due to cold weather in the first quarter of  while operating contribution for was negatively impacted by extremely weak refining margins and extensive scheduled refinery turnaround maintenance at the avon and ferndale refineries 
the improved operating contribution of was partially offset by higher refinery operating costs and declines in production levels 
higher refinery operating costs were primarily due to the trainer refinery acquired in a shutdown state in february  increased energy costs  and higher depreciation costs 
although raw material throughput for declined by  b d to  b d  production of clean products increased by  b d to  b d 
production of clean products was aided by the completion of the solvent deasphalting unit sda at the bayway refinery in august the sda processes low value residual fuel to produce feedstock for the cat cracker  the refinery s principal gasoline manufacturing unit  and reduces the amount of high cost  partially refined feedstocks that bayway purchases from third parties 
operating contribution from tosco s retail operations increased by million to million for  primarily because of the acquisition of circle k 
retail volume of fuel sales approximately doubled to billion gallons  and the blended fuel margin increased by cents per gallon to cents per gallon 
the fuel margin improvement was primarily attributable to the higher proportion of sales from company operated stores 
operating contribution from retail operations also improved due to expanded merchandise sales of approximately billion for with margins of 
these improved margins were reduced by station operating and other costs of the approximately  convenience stores acquired in the circle k acquisition 
selling  general  and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in this increase of million was due to tosco s expanded operations and higher levels of incentive compensation due to improved operating results 
interest expense increased in  despite the reduction in interest costs resulting from the receivable transfer agreement  due to higher debt levels related to tosco s expanded operations and higher price levels of raw materials and products 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes in increased by million to million due to improved pre tax income and a higher effective tax rate primarily due to the circle k acquisition 
outlook results of operations are primarily determined by the operating efficiency of the refineries  and refining and retail fuel margins 
normal levels of maintenance are scheduled for and tosco expects  given reasonable margins  to operate its refineries at high levels during refining and retail fuel margins in early are weak 
while margins are expected to improve during the balance of  tosco is not able to predict the level or timing of refinery and retail fuel operating margins for the year because of the uncertainties associated with oil markets 
in view of uncertain operating margins and highly competitive markets  tosco is committed to improving its results by lowering costs in all areas of operation without compromising safety  reliability  or environmental compliance 
in february  tosco entered into a long term contract with occidental petroleum company occidental to buy a substantial portion of occidental s crude oil production from the elk hills oil and gas field in california at market related pricing 
tosco plans to build a mile pipeline from the elk hills field to existing lines that serve the san francisco area refinery system 
this domestic supply of light crude oil will reduce the need for tosco to purchase waterborne crude oil 
cash flows during  cash and cash equivalents decreased by million  as cash used in investing activities of billion exceeded cash provided by operating and financing activities of million and million  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities of million was from cash earnings of million net income plus depreciation  amortization  deferred income taxes  and inventory writedown and an increase in working capital of million less million for other expenditures 
the increase in working capital  net of the acquired products assets  is primarily due to the opening of the trainer refinery 
net cash used in investing activities of billion included the acquisition of products assets billion  capital additions million  and a net increase in deferred turnarounds  deferred charges and other assets million  partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of products assets million and other items million 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million as proceeds from a notes and debentures offering of million  a common stock offering of million  and net borrowings under the revolving credit facility of million exceeded the repayments under long term debt agreements and circle k pre acquisition debt of million  funds used to repurchase common stock issued to unocal of million  dividend payments of million  and other items of million 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity as measured by cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  deposits  and availability under the revolving credit facility increased by million during  to million at december  increases in availability under the revolving credit facility of million and marketable securities and deposits of million were partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million 
at december   total shareholders equity was billion  a million increase from the december  balance of billion 
this increase was due to the issuance of million shares of common stock for million and net income of million less dividends and other items of million 
debt  including current maturities  increased by million to billion at december  as cash flows from operating activities were used to reduce the higher levels of debt resulting from the products acquisition 
the ratio of long term debt revolving credit facility and non current portion of long term debt to total capitalization long term debt  trust preferred securities  and shareholders equity increased from at december  to at december  in january  tosco filed a shelf registration statement providing for the issuance of up to billion aggregate principal amount of debt and equity securities 
such securities may be offered  separately or together  in amounts and at prices and terms to be set forth in one or more supplements to the shelf registration statement 
on may   tosco issued million shares of common stock pursuant to this shelf registration statement for gross proceeds of million 
at december   tosco may issue up to million of securities pursuant to this shelf registration statement 
the revolving credit facility  as well as funds potentially available from the issuance of securities  provides tosco with adequate resources to meet its expected liquidity demands for at least the next twelve months 
capital expenditures on march   tosco completed the products acquisition 
additionally  tosco spent million primarily on budgeted capital projects in the trainer refinery  acquired in a shut down mode in february  was started up in may after an approximate million modernization and upgrading program 
other refinery capital spending programs were for compliance with environmental regulations and permits  personnel process safety programs  and operating flexibility and reliability projects 
retail capital spending was focused on rationalizing and rebranding of the retail system  integrating operations  enhancing existing sites  and underground storage tank upgrades and replacements 
during january  tosco completed the purchase of approximately convenience stores by paying off the outstanding balance on a real estate installment purchase note  including the settlement of contingent payments  for million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
tosco expects to fund its refinery and retail capital expenditures from cash provided by operations  available credit  and other resources 
capital spending for retail operations in will be focused on enhancing existing retail sites  integrating operations  and the completion of tosco s program to upgrade or replace underground storage tanks to meet federal and state regulatory deadlines 
the rebranding of bp service stations in northern california to the tradename is expected to be completed in the first quarter of risk management tosco uses a variety of strategies to reduce commodity price  interest  and operational risks 
tosco  at times and when able  uses futures and forward contracts to lock in what it believes to be favorable margins on a varying portion of refinery production by taking offsetting long obligation to buy at a fixed price positions in crude oil and short obligation to deliver at a fixed price positions in gasoline and heating oil 
this strategy hedges tosco s exposure to fluctuations in refining margins and therefore tends to reduce the volatility of operating results 
in addition  tosco enters into swap contracts with counterparties to hedge sales prices of residual fuels production 
futures and forward contracts are also used to a lesser extent to hedge inventories stored for future sale and to hedge against adverse price movements between the cost of domestic and foreign crude oil 
tosco uses a value at risk var model to assess the market risk of its derivative instruments 
var represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors  for a specified time period and confidence level 
tosco estimates var across its derivative instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated using a one day interval 
tosco s measured var from holding such derivative instruments  using a var model with a confidence level and assuming normal market conditions at december   was immaterial 
tosco s calculated var exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on its derivative instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may occur 
the calculated var does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected loss that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated  based upon actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures  and the timing thereof  and changes in tosco s holdings of derivative instruments during the year 
tosco manages its interest rate risk by maintaining a mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt 
floating rate debt  primarily borrowings under the revolving credit facility  which currently provides up to billion of uncollateralized revolving credit availability  is used to finance tosco s working capital requirements 
tosco issued million of notes and debentures in connection with the products acquisition at fixed interest rates 
other fixed rate debt consists of million uncollateralized noncallable notes issued in july to repay indebtedness under the previously outstanding collateralized revolving credit facility  million of mortgage bonds issued in and to refinance previously outstanding floating rate bank debt and to finance the acquisition of capital assets including the acquisition of the bayway refinery  and million uncollateralized noncallable notes issued in may to finance a portion of the circle k purchase price 
tosco carries insurance policies on insurable risks  which it believes to be appropriate at commercially reasonable rates 
while tosco believes that it is adequately insured  future losses could exceed insurance policy limits or  under adverse interpretations  be excluded from coverage 
future liability or costs  if any  incurred under such circumstances would have to be paid out of general corporate funds  if available 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of tosco s strategy to reduce credit risk 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation has been less significant during recent years because of the relatively low rates experienced in the united states 
raw material  energy  and labor are important components of tosco s costs 
any or all of these components could be increased by inflation  with a possible adverse effect on profitability  especially in high inflation periods when raw material and energy cost increases generally lead finished product prices 
impact of the year issue tosco recognizes the need to ensure that its computer operations and operating systems will not be adversely affected by the year issue and is cognizant of the time sensitive nature of the problem 
since  tosco has been proactively upgrading and replacing its business systems while integrating the circle k and products acquisitions 
tosco has assessed how its critical business systems may be affected by the year issue and has formulated and is implementing plans to address the known year issues 
that plan  as it relates to business systems  involves a combination of additional software upgrades  replacements  and modifications 
tosco believes the cost of year compliance for its business systems will not have a material adverse effect on tosco s future operating results 
tosco is currently assessing the impact of the year issue on its field systems and software suppliers 
accordingly  tosco is unable to estimate the costs related to these year issues 
however  tosco does not believe its year costs related to its field systems and software suppliers will have a material adverse effect on tosco s future operating results
