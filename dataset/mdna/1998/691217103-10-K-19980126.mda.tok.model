sales of a coils were million net sales in the specialized equipment segment were million  an increase over net sales of million 
this increase was a result of the inclusion of a full year s results of great bend manufacturing and a increase in sales of grain handling equipment at parker industries  partially offset by a decline of in net sales of sooner s aluminum trailers and lower net sales at deweze  which was affected by low cattle prices 
the increase in sales of grain handling equipment was due to favorable pricing and production conditions for farmers in the central united states  an improved product line  and comparison to fiscal in which parker was out of production during its traditionally slow first quarter as the plant was expanded

lower sales at dura bond and snowmax resulted in decreased gross profit at those subsidiaries

the inventory reduction program resulted in an increase in cost of goods sold of  gross profit in the specialized equipment segment decreased to million  or of net sales in  from million  or of net sales  in the prior year 
this decrease was primarily attributable to a reduced gross margin at sooner resulting from decreased sales as a result of reduced demand in the second half of fiscal and production inefficiencies that led to slower shipments 
these production problems  caused in part by the disruptive effects of an ultimately unsuccessful union organization campaign and high employee turnover  combined with the decline in sales  reduced gross profit at sooner by million as compared to the decrease attributable to sooner was partially offset by the inclusion of great bend for a full year

cyclicality the company s engineered component products segment is subject to changes in the overall level of domestic economic activity 
the specialized equipment segment is subject to changes in certain sectors of the agricultural economy  which may be influenced by climate changes and governmental policy
