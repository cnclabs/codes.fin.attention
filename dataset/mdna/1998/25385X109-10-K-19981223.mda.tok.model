the company s net sales for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal the decline is due primarily to the following factors the company s efforts to refocus its efforts on its digital video software product lines while discontinuing the development of its color publishing  accelerated color graphics products and its dos on mac products  and a decline in fourth quarter sales of its color publishing products due to the agreement for the license of significant assets of its monitor business to korea data systems america  inc kds 
the color display products had million in sales for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal as a result of these factors  product sales decreased in fiscal from fiscal commissions and royalties decreased in fiscal by to million from million in fiscal due to the termination of the exclusive distributor relationships in europe and japan and due to the expiration of the royalty agreement with umax computer corporation in march also as a result of the distributor relationships in japan and europe  the company s export sales for fiscal declined to million as compared to million for fiscal the company anticipates that sales in asia will remain weak for the near future 
sales growth in the asia market has been impacted by certain factors including weaker economic conditions and stronger dollar versus the local currencies 
revenue is recognized when products are shipped 
sales to certain distributors are subject to agreements allowing certain rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise held by these distributors 
the company provides for estimated returns at the time of shipment and for price protection following price declines 
revenue earned under royalty or commission agreements is recognized in the period in which it is earned 
as a result of the kds transaction  the company anticipates significantly lower overall net sales in the immediate future 
future sales will be predominately attributable to sales of software products since the company s digital video product line is primarily software 
revenue recognition related to software product sales is as follows revenue from the sale of software  net of estimated returns  is recognized upon either shipment of the physical product or delivery of electronic product  at which time  collectibility is probable and the company has no remaining obligations 
in may  the financial accounting standards board approved the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  software revenue recognition sop 
sop provides revised and expanded guidance on software revenue recognition and applies to all entities that earn revenue from licensing  selling or otherwise marketing computer software 
sop is effective for transactions entered into in fiscal years beginning after december  the application of sop is not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
the sale of the software products for digital video camcorders photodv introduced in april and motodv introduced in september and editdv introduced in november have increased during there can be no assurance that sales of these software products will continue to increase or that they will increase to a sufficient extent to offset the elimination of hardware sales 
effective january   the company modified its relationships with its distributors in japan and europe for its digital video software products 
rather than paying commissions to radius for products sold  they purchase products from the company at a discount from the price list 
commissions will still be paid on the sales of the company s other products sold through these distributors  although the company believes that these sales will not be material 
one customer accounted for of the company s net sales for fiscal for fiscal the same distributor accounted for of the company s net sales 
gross profit 
the company s gross profit margin was for fiscal  as compared with for fiscal this increase was a result of the company s decision to refocus its business on higher margin digital video software products 
included in fiscal cost of sales are one time charges of million consisting principally of inventory write downs of million and reserves for excess purchase order commitments of million for inventory in excess of anticipated demand 
these charges reflect decreases in demand and the company s decision to refocus its business 
excluding these one time charges  gross profit margin in fiscal was 
the company expects the gross profit margins will be higher in the future due to the impact of the decreased sales of monitor products and focus on sales of higher gross margin software products 
additionally  the company is taking further steps to reduce product costs and control expenses 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s gross margins will improve or remain at current levels 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased from million or of net sales for fiscal to million or of net sales for fiscal the company decreased its research and development expenses primarily by reducing expenses related to headcount resulting from the company s efforts to refocus its business 
the increase in research and development expenses expressed as a percentage of net sales for fiscal was primarily attributable to the decrease in net sales and the company s refocusing on higher margin products  rather than high volume  lower margin products 
the company expects that decreases in its research and development expenses due to the de emphasis in its monitor business will be offset by increases in the expenses for the digital video product line and therefore  expects to devote approximately million to research and development during the entire fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from million or of net sales for fiscal to million or of net sales for fiscal included in these expenses for fiscal is a million charge to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts due to accounts which the company determined were unlikely to be collected in full 
adjusting for these charges and reductions  selling  general and administrative expenses would have been million or of net sales in fiscal the company decreased its fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses in absolute and percentage terms primarily by reducing expenses related to headcount resulting from the company s efforts to refocus its business 
although the company expects selling  general and administrative expenses to increase gradually over time  the company does not expect them to approach historical levels in absolute amount 
other income expense  net 
other income was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the other income for fiscal was due to the sale of  shares of splash common stock compared to  shares of splash common stock in fiscal fiscal also includes million related to the kds license 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal this decrease was due to lower average borrowings primarily as a result of the repayment of the working capital line of credit to ibm credit 
provision for income taxes 
the company recorded a reversal of accrual for income taxes of million for fiscal compared to a provision of million for fiscal the reversal reflects the fact that exposure in certain foreign jurisdictions  as a result of the passage of time  has become remote 
the provision for fiscal differs from the provision computed utilizing the combined statutory rate in effect during the period primarily as a result of the impact of foreign taxes offset by the impact of previously unused net operating losses and the reversal of existing deferred tax assets 
fasb statement  accounting for income taxes  provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
the company s valuation allowance reduced the deferred tax asset to the amount realizable 
the company has provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets due to uncertainties surrounding their realization 
due to the net losses reported in prior years and as a result of the material changes in operations  predictability of earnings in future periods is uncertain 
the company will evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
as a result of the issuance of common stock and series a convertible preferred stock in exchange for certain liabilities of the company in september  the company experienced a change in ownership as defined under section of the internal revenue code 
accordingly  utilization of substantial net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards will be subject to an approximate million annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions  except under limited circumstances 
this limitation will result in the expiration of all of the tax credit carryforwards and a substantial portion of the net operating loss carryforwards without full utilization

net income loss 
as a result of the above factors  the company had net income of  in fiscal compared to a net income of  for fiscal fiscal to fiscal net sales 
the company s net sales for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal the decline is due to the following factors the company s efforts to refocus its business on higher margin products  the divestiture of certain business units  such as its color server copy group which had million in sales for fiscal  entering into distributor arrangements for japan and europe effective april  and july   respectively  which relationships provide for the company to recognize as net sales  a percentage of the sales price of each product sold by those distributors as compared to the entire sales price of the product which was recognized by the company as net sales prior to the appointment of these distributors  uncertainty regarding the viability of the apple macintosh product line  and the slow development of the d graphics market due to limited applications software availability 
as a result of these factors  product sales decreased in fiscal from fiscal commissions and royalties increased in fiscal by to million from million in fiscal due to the distributor relationships in europe and japan and due to royalties paid by umax computer corporation under its license agreement for the macos compatible systems signed in february also as a result of the distributor relationships in japan and europe  the company s export sales for fiscal declined to of net sales as compared to of net sales for fiscal one customer accounted for of the company s net sales for fiscal for fiscal the same distributor accounted for of the company s net sales

in april  approximately million was released from this escrow to the company and the company also received approximately million as a result of post closing adjustments 
as of september   million remained in this escrow 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
the shares of series b preferred stock were converted into shares of splash common stock in connection with the initial public offering of splash 
such stock was pledged to ibm credit in order to secure the company s obligations to ibm credit under the restructured loan agreement with ibm credit 
in connection with the restructuring of the terms of its loan agreement with ibm credit  the company granted ibm credit an option to purchase shares of series b preferred stock at a nominal amount  shares of splash common stock after conversion 
the company has certain indemnification obligations in connection with the patent lawsuit brought by electronics for imaging  inc see note to consolidated financial statements 
the net proceeds of the csg transaction were paid to silicon valley bank svb  in order to repay the company s indebtedness to svb  and to ibm credit  in order to reduce the company s outstanding indebtedness to ibm credit 
as of july  ibm credit had exercised all its option to purchase splash common stock and the working capital line of credit with ibm credit was fully repaid in fiscal portrait display labs

under these agreements  pdl also settled its outstanding receivable to the company by paying the company  in cash and issuing to the company  shares of pdl s common stock 
the cash proceeds were paid to ibm credit 
the company does not expect to realize any material value from pdl s common stock 
umax data systems  inc 
in february  the company sold its macos compatible systems business to umax computer corporation ucc  a company formed by umax data systems  inc umax 
the company received approximately million in cash and debt relief and  shares of ucc s common stock  representing approximately of ucc s then outstanding shares of ucc common stock 
the cash proceeds were paid to ibm credit and the shares of ucc common stock were pledged to ibm credit 
in march  due to apple computer s reversal in macos licensing policy  the company sold the common stock of umax computer corporation held by it to umax data systems  inc for  liquidity and capital resources the company s cash and cash equivalents decreased approximately million during fiscal to approximately million at september   as compared with the fiscal ending balance of cash and cash equivalents of million 
approximately million of the million of cash and cash equivalents available at september  was restricted under a letter of credit 
the decrease in the company s cash and cash equivalents during fiscal was primarily attributable to funding of operating losses of the company 
as of september   the company s total assets had decreased to million from million on september  the company s liabilities exceeded its assets 
this was due primarily to the substantial decline in the trading price of splash common stock from as of the end of fiscal to an average of which was realized on the sale of the splash common stock during fiscal the proceeds of the sale of the splash common stock were used to repay in full the working line of credit with ibm credit  and to fund the operating losses of the company 
under the license and asset transfer agreement with kds  radius has transferred by licensing or by assignment if kds elects to close the asset transfer agreement its radius  supermac  pressview and certain other trademarks to kds and has licensed certain intellectual property pertaining to pressview and precisionview monitors 
kds has not agreed to purchase any inventory or other tangible assets of radius under these agreements 
the expected value of the transaction is million which is payable in installments  including million paid in august and million in september and million in june the remaining amount is payable in installments through october kds performance is guaranteed by a korean corporation and its us affiliate 
the asset transfer agreement is expected to close by june  if contingencies are satisfied 
these installment payment obligations have been pledged to secure a million line of credit from silicon valley bank 
there can be no assurance that the closing will occur or that installment payments under the license will be timely made 
the company had agreed with kds to continue to support the sale of monitors through the company s sales force during august and september in return for  a month and a sharing of the gross margin from the sale of the monitor products during this period 
the company will provide a diminishing level of support until kds has fully assumed all relevant activities 
kds will reimburse the company for this support 
the company believes that the cash flows from kds  results of operations and other sources of financing will be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next months 
however  there can be no assurances that the sale of software products will continue to increase to a sufficient extent to offset the loss of revenues and gross margin from the monitor business or that the installment payments will be timely made 
the company may need to further reduce its operating expenses or seek additional sources of working capital if software product sales do not increase at the rate assumed in the company s current operating plans 
the company and its management believes that it can further reduce such operating expenses  if necessary  and that other sources of financing will be available 
the company s principal sources of liquidity currently are cash generated by operations  if any  and up to million working capital line of credit provided by silicon valley bank which is secured by the installment payment obligations of the kds transaction 
under the terms of the million working capital line of credit  the amount available to borrow will be decreased by eighty percent of the payments made by kds  since the borrowing base under the working capital line of credit is eighty percent of the unpaid balance of kds installment obligations 
as the borrowing base is dependent on the continued payment of monthly installments  there can be no assurance that it will be sufficient to allow the company to borrow up to the full amount of the working capital line of credit 
the company anticipates that it will not have significant cash available for expenditures other than for its ordinary course of business operating expenses 
in the event the company were unable to generate sufficient net sales or if the company incurs unforeseen operating expenses  it may not be able to meet its operating expenses without additional financing 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain factors that may affect the company s future results of operations need for additional financing  loan restrictions 
capital expenditures were approximately million during fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal and were primarily for leasehold improvements and upgrading the company s management information systems 
the company expects this level of expenditures to continue in fiscal barring unexpected developments 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation certain factors that may affect the company s future results of operations impact year at september   the company s principal commitments consisted of obligations under a loan agreement with silicon valley bank and its obligations under building leases 
see notes and to consolidated financial statements 
the company is also a party to various litigation proceedings  the costs of defending or the outcome of which could adversely affect the company s liquidity 
see business legal proceedings 
certain factors that may affect the company s future results of operations a number of uncertainties exist that could affect the company s future operating results  including  without limitation  the following continuing operating losses the company experienced operating losses in each of its prior five fiscal years 
in the future  the company s ability to achieve and subsequently sustain profitable operations will depend upon a number of factors  including the company s ability to control costs  the company s ability to service its outstanding indebtedness to silicon valley bank  timely receipt of the kds transaction installment payments  the company s ability to generate sufficient cash from operations or obtain additional funds to fund its operating expenses  the company s ability to successfully market its software products  the company s ability to develop innovative and cost competitive new products and to bring those products to market in a timely manner  the commercial acceptance of apple computers and the macos and the rate and mix of apple computers and related products sold  the company s ability to successfully develop and market products for the microsoft windows and nt operating systems in a timely manner  competitive factors such as new product introductions  product enhancements and aggressive marketing and pricing practices  general economic conditions  the company s ability to successfully negotiate a lease renewal for its main office facility  and negotiate a settlement or other favorable conclusion of the efi and ie litigation  and other factors 
for these and other reasons  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve or subsequently maintain profitability in the near term  if at all 
fluctuations in operating results the company has experienced substantial fluctuations in operating results 
the company s customers generally order on an as needed basis  and the company has historically operated with relatively small backlogs 
quarterly sales and operating results depend heavily on the volume and timing of bookings received during the quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
a substantial portion of the company s revenues are derived from sales made late in each quarter  which increases the difficulty in forecasting sales accurately 
since the end of the company s fiscal year  shortages of available cash have restricted the company s ability to purchase inventory and have delayed the company s receipt of products from suppliers and increased shipping and other costs 
furthermore  because of its financial condition  the company believes that many suppliers are hesitant to continue their relationships with or extend credit terms to the company and potential new suppliers are reluctant to provide goods to the company 
the company recognizes sales upon shipment of product  and allowances are recorded for estimated uncollectable amounts  returns  credits and similar costs  including product warranties and price protection 
due to the inherent uncertainty of such estimates  there can be no assurance that the company s forecasts regarding bookings  collections  rates of return  credits and related matters will be accurate 
a significant portion of the operating expenses of the company are relatively fixed in nature  and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts which  as indicated above  are uncertain 
any inability on the part of the company to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for any failure to meet sales forecasts or to receive anticipated collections  or any unexpected increase in product returns or other costs  could also have an adverse impact on the company s operating results 
as a strategic response to a changing competitive environment  the company has elected  and  in the future  may elect from time to time  to make certain pricing  service or marketing decisions or acquisitions that could have a mateial adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company also completed a variety of business divestitures during fiscal  and  restructured the terms of its indebtedness to ibm credit and issued a substantial amount of equity in the company to its creditors in satisfaction of approximately million in claims and indebtedness during the fourth quarter of fiscal and has licensed and agreed to sell its monitor business in august in addition  the company is focusing its efforts on developing and marketing software products  an area in which it has limited experience 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations will not necessarily be meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is likely that in some future quarter the company s operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would be likely to be materially adversely affected 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
need for additional financing  loan restrictions as of september   the company had a working capital deficit of million 
the company intends to finance its working capital needs through cash generated by operations and borrowings under a working capital line of credit with silicon valley bank 
because the company has experienced operating losses in each of its prior five fiscal years and has liabilities in excess of assets  the company must significantly reduce operating expenses and or significantly increase net sales in order to finance its working capital needs with cash generated by operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully fund its working capital needs internally 
although the silicon valley bank loan provides for a working capital line of credit of up to million  the company will only be able to borrow amounts up to the borrowing base which is defined as eighty percent of the unpaid portion of the kds transaction installment payments 
once the line of credit has been reduced to zero  the company does not expect that it will be a source of working capital in the future 
in the event that cash from operations and the working capital line of credit are insufficient to fund the company s working capital needs  the company may need to raise additional capital through public or private financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the failure of the company to raise capital when needed would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
if the additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of the company of its then current shareholders would be reduced 
furthermore  such equity securities might have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the company s common stock 
dependence on and competition with apple although the company has begun to market certain products for the windows environment  it is expected that sales of products for apple computers will continue to represent a significant portion of the company s sales for fiscal apple has lost significant market share over recent years 
the company s operating results would be adversely affected if these trends should continue or if other developments were to adversely affect apple s business 
furthermore  any continued difficulty that may be experienced by apple in the development  manufacturing  marketing or sale of its computers  or other disruptions to  or uncertainty in the market regarding apple s business  resulting from these or other factors  could result in further reduced demand for apple computers  which in turn could materially and adversely affect sales of the company s products 
as software applications for the color publishing and multimedia markets become more available on platforms other than macintosh  it is likely that these other platforms will continue to gain acceptance in these markets 
for example  newer versions of the windows operating environment support high performance graphics and video applications similar to those offered on the macintosh 
there is a risk that this trend will reduce the support given to macintosh products by third party developers and could substantially reduce demand for macintosh products and peripherals over the long term 
a number of the company s products compete with products marketed by apple 
as a competitor of the company  apple could in the future take steps to hinder the company s development of compatible products and slow sales of the company s products 
the company s business is based in part on supplying products that meet the needs of high end customers that are not fully met by apple s products 
as apple improves its products or bundles additional hardware or software into its computers  it reduces the market for radius products that provide those capabilities 
in the past  the company has developed new products as apple s progress has rendered existing company products obsolete 
however  in light of the company s current financial condition there can be no assurance that the company will continue to develop new products on a timely basis or that any such products will be successful 
in order to develop products for the macintosh on a timely basis  the company depends upon access to advance information concerning new macintosh products 
a decision by apple to cease sharing advance product information with the company would adversely affect the company s business 
new products anticipated from and introduced by apple could cause customers to defer or alter buying decisions due to uncertainty in the marketplace  as well as presenting additional direct competition for the company 
in addition  apple may introduce a non linear digital video software editing program during fiscal which could adversely affect and reduce sales of editdv 
in the past  transitions in apple s products have been accompanied by shortages in those products and in key components for them  leading to a slowdown in sales of those products and in the development and sale by the company of compatible products 
dependence on and competition with microsoft new products introduced by microsoft could cause customers to defer or alter buying decisions due to uncertainty in the marketplace  as well as present additional competition for the company 
in addition  it is possible that the introduction of new microsoft products with improved performance capabilities may create uncertainties in the market concerning the need for the performance enhancements provided by the company s products and could reduce demand for such products 
competition the markets for the company s products are highly competitive  and the company expects competition to intensify 
many of the company s current and prospective competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  manufacturing and marketing resources than the company 
the company believes that its ability to compete will depend on a number of factors  including the amount of financial resources available to the company  its ability to repay its indebtedness  success and timing of new product developments by the company and its competitors  product performance  price and quality  breadth of distribution and customer support 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully with respect to these factors 
in addition  the introduction of lower priced competitive products could result in price reductions that would adversely affect the company s results of operations 
see business competition 
dependence on limited number of manufacturers and suppliers the company outsources the manufacturing and assembly of its products to third party manufacturers 
although the company uses a number of manufacturer assemblers  each of its products is manufactured and assembled by a single manufacturer 
the failure of a manufacturer to ship the quantities of a product ordered by the company could cause a material disruption in the company s sales of that product 
in the past the company has experienced substantial delays in its ability to fill customer orders due to the inability of certain manufacturers to meet their volume and schedule requirements 
there can be no assurance that manufacturers will not require special terms in order to continue their relationship with the company 
the company is also dependent on sole or limited source suppliers for certain key components used in its products 
certain other components are purchased from sole or limited source suppliers 
the company purchases these sole or limited source components primarily pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time in the ordinary course of business and has no guaranteed supply arrangements with sole or limited source suppliers 
therefore  these suppliers are not obligated to supply products to the company for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at any specific price  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order 
although the company expects that these suppliers will continue to meet its requirements for the components  there can be no assurance that they will do so  particularly in light of the company s financial condition 
the company s reliance on a limited number of suppliers involves a number of risks  including the absence of adequate capacity  the unavailability or interruption in the supply of key components and reduced control over delivery schedules and costs 
the company expects to continue to rely on a limited number of suppliers for the foreseeable future 
if these suppliers became unwilling or unable to continue to provide these components the company would have to develop alternative sources for these components which could result in delays or reductions in product shipments which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
certain suppliers  due to the company s shortages in available cash  have put the company on a cash or prepay basis and or required the company to provide security for their risk in procuring components or reserving manufacturing time  and there is a risk that suppliers will discontinue their relationship with the company 
the introduction of new products presents additional difficulties in obtaining timely shipments from suppliers 
additional time may be needed to identify and qualify suppliers of the new products 
also  the company has experienced delays in achieving volume production of new products due to the time required for suppliers to build their manufacturing capacity 
an extended interruption in the supply of any of the components for the company s products  regardless of the cause  could have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
technological change  continuing need to develop new products the video applications industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology  often resulting in short product life cycles and rapid price declines 
the company believes that its success will be highly dependent on its ability to develop innovative and cost competitive new products and to bring them to the marketplace in a timely manner 
should the company fail to introduce new products on a timely basis  the company s operating results could be adversely affected 
as a result of the company s financial condition  it has had to significantly reduce its research and development expenditures 
for the fiscal year  the company spent approximately million  for the fiscal year  the company spent approximately million on research and development as compared with approximately million for the fiscal year 
continued reduction in the available cash resources of the company could result in the interruption or cancellation of research and product development efforts which would have a material adverse effect on the business  operating results and financial condition of the company 
the company anticipates that the video editing industry will follow the pattern of the professional publishing industry in which desktop publishing products  including those produced by radius  replaced more expensive  proprietary products  and the company also anticipates that this evolution will lead to an increase in the purchase and use of video editing products  in particular digital video editing products for use with digital video camcorders 
as a result  the company has devoted significant resources to this product line 
there can be no assurance that this evolution will occur in the digital video editing industry as expected by the company  or that even if it does occur that it will not occur at a slower pace than anticipated 
there can also be no assurance that any digital video editing products developed by the company will achieve consumer acceptance or broad commercial success 
in the event that the increased use of such video editing products does not occur or in the event that the company is unable to successfully develop and market such products  the company s business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected  particularly in light of the fact that the company has licensed or sold its remaining hardware product lines over the last three years 
dependence on indirect distribution channels the company s primary means of distribution is through a limited number of third party distributors that are not under the direct control of the company 
furthermore  the company relies on one primary distributor for its sales in japan and is creating a new distribution network in europe 
the company maintains only a small direct sales force 
as a result  the company s business and financial results are highly dependent on the amount of the company s products that is ordered by these distributors 
such orders are in turn dependent upon the continued viability and financial condition of these distributors as well as on their ability to resell such products and maintain appropriate inventory levels 
furthermore  many of these distributors generally carry the product lines of a number of companies  are not subject to minimum order requirements and can discontinue marketing the company s products at any time 
accordingly  the company must compete for the focus and sales efforts of these third parties 
in addition  due in part to the historical volatility of the personal computer industry  certain of the company s distributors have from time to time experienced declining profit margins  cash flow shortages and other financial difficulties 
the future growth and success of the company will continue to depend in large part upon its indirect distribution channels 
if its distributors were to experience financial difficulties  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected 
international sales prior to the second fiscal quarter of  the company s international sales were primarily made through distributors and the company s subsidiary in japan 
effective april  and july  the company appointed distributors for japan and europe  respectively 
effective january   the company modified its relationships with these distributors for its digital video software products 
rather than paying commissions to radius for products sold  they purchase products from the company at a discount from the price list 
commissions will still be paid on the sales of the company s other products sold through these distributors  although the company believes that these sales will not be material 
although such distribution arrangements are no longer exclusive  no other distributor has yet been retained in either area 
the company expects that international sales  primarily in europe  will represent a significant portion of its business activity and that it will be subject to the normal risks of international sales such as currency fluctuations  longer payment cycles  export controls and other governmental regulations and  in some countries  a lesser degree of intellectual property protection as compared to that provided under the laws of the united states 
sales in japan could be affected by the economic conditions in that region  which are currently unfavorable 
sales in asian markets  which are also unfavorable  have not been  and the company does not expect them to be  material in the future outside of japan 
furthermore  a reduction in sales efforts or financial viability of the distributors could adversely affect the company s net sales and its ability to provide service and support to japanese and european customers 
additionally  fluctuations in exchange rates could affect demand for the company s products 
if for any reason exchange or price controls or other restrictions on foreign currencies are imposed  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
dependence on key personnel the company s success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of its key management  marketing  product development and operational personnel and the company s ability to retain and continue to attract highly skilled personnel 
the company currently has one executive officer 
the company does not carry any key person life insurance with respect to any of its personnel 
competition for employees in the computer industry is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain qualified employees 
many members of the company s senior management team have departed since  including its former president and chief executive officer  two chief financial officers and four other vice presidents  and the company has also had substantial layoffs and other employee departures 
because of the company s financial difficulties and the very tight labor market for technical personnel  it has become increasingly difficult for it to hire new employees and retain key management and current employees 
the failure of the company to attract and retain key personnel would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
dependence on proprietary rights the company relies on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret protection  nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to establish and protect its proprietary rights 
the company has a number of patents and patent applications and intends to file additional patent applications as it considers appropriate 
there can be no assurance that patents will issue from any of these pending applications or  if patents do issue  that any claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect the company s technology 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any patents that may be issued to the company will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that any rights granted thereunder would provide proprietary protection to the company 
the company has a number of trademarks and trademark applications 
there can be no assurance that litigation with respect to trademarks will not result from the company s use of registered or common law marks  or that  if litigation against the company were successful  any resulting loss of the right to use a trademark would not reduce sales of the company s products in addition to the possibility of a significant damages award 
although the company intends to defend its proprietary rights  policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology or products is difficult  and there can be no assurance that the company s efforts will be successful 
the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect the proprietary rights of the company to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
the company has received  and may receive in the future  communications asserting that its products infringe the proprietary rights of third parties  and the company is engaged and has been engaged in litigation alleging that the company s products infringe others patent rights 
as a result of such claims or litigation  it may become necessary or desirable in the future for the company to obtain licenses relating to one or more of its products or relating to current or future technologies  and there can be no assurance that it would be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms

impact of year the year issue yk issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs or hardware that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company s plan to resolve the yk issue involves the following four phases assessment  remediation  testing  and implementation 
to date  the company has fully completed its assessment of all internal systems and products that could be significantly affected 
the assessment of risks associated with suppliers and distributors is not yet complete 
based on recent assessments of its information management and accounting systems  the company has determined that it will be required to modify or replace significant portions of its software and certain hardware so that those systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  the company presently believes that with such modifications  the yk issue can be mitigated without a material adverse impact on the company 
however  if such modifications and replacements are not timely made  the yk issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
none of these systems interoperate directly with the systems of suppliers or distributors 
based on a review of its product line  the company has determined that primarily all of the products it has sold and will continue to sell do not require remediation to be year compliant  as primarily all operate in conjunction with the macos 
accordingly  the company does not believe that the yk issue presents a material risk with respect to the company s products 
the company is approximately through the remediation phase with respect to its information management and accounting systems and expects to complete software and hardware replacement no later than september  once the software and hardware is replaced for a system  the company begins testing and implementation 
these phases run concurrently for different systems 
the company has completed of its testing 
completion of the testing phase for all significant software systems is expected by january   with all remediated systems fully tested and implemented by december  none of the company systems interface directly with significant third party suppliers 
the company is starting the process of working with third party suppliers and distributors to ensure that any company systems that could interface directly with third parties are year compliant by december  remediation and testing of all significant systems is expected no later than december  the company believes that its key suppliers  two of whom are sole sources  are in the process of making their billing systems year compliant 
the company is not aware of any supplier or distributor with a yk issue that would materially impact the company s results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
however  the company has no means of ensuring that such suppliers and distributors will be year ready 
the inability of suppliers and distributors to complete their year resolution process in a timely fashion could materially impact the company 
there are no vendors that could not be replaced in a reasonable period of time  except for transport vendors 
the failure of fedex  ups  airborne and the us mail would impact direct sales 
the effect of this occurrence is not determinable 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  test  and implement the software and operating equipment for year compliance 
the total future cost of the year compliance is estimated at  to  and is being funded through net cash flows or capital leases 
some of these expenditures were likely to have been made in the ordinary course of upgrading and replacing obsolete systems without regard to the yk issue 
through fiscal  the company has incurred less than  related to all phases of the year project and  has been budgeted for fiscal  under the assumption that most of the new system cost will be funded via leasing 
management of the company believes it has an effective program in place to resolve those aspects of the yk issue within its control in a timely manner 
as noted above  the company has not completed all necessary phases of the year program 
in the event that the company does not complete these phases  the company would be unable in some degree to take customer orders  manufacture and ship products  invoice customers and collect payments 
in addition  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues could also materially adversely affect the company 
the company could be subject to litigation for computer systems product failure  for example  equipment shutdown or failure to properly date business records 
furthermore  although management is not aware of any yk issue with products sold  there can be no assurance that the use of such products alone or in conjunction with other products will not malfunction and expose the company to liability 
the amount of potential liability and lost revenue associated with these risks cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
the company has contingency plans for certain critical applications and is working on such plans for others 
these contingency plans involve  among other actions  manual workarounds  increasing inventories  and adjusting staffing strategies 
all of the company s production  shipping  purchasing  billing and inventory functions could be accomplished via outsource vendors that are currently readily available  although there can be no assurance that such vendors will be available on reasonable terms as the millenium approaches
