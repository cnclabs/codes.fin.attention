factors that may affect future results the terminal  monitor and multimedia product markets are intensely competitive 
the principal elements of competition are pricing  product quality and reliability  price performance characteristics  compatibility  marketing and distribution capability  service and support  and reputation of the manufacturer 
televideo competes with a large number of manufacturers  most of which have significantly greater financial  marketing and technological resources than televideo 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to compete effectively 
the company markets its products worldwide 
in addition  a large portion of the company s part and component manufacturing  along with key suppliers  are located outside the united states 
accordingly  the company s future results could be adversely affected by a variety of factors  including without limitation  fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  trade protection measures  import or export licensing requirements  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and natural disasters 
the computer market  particularly the multimedia product market  is characterized by rapid technological change and product obsolescence  often resulting in short product life cycles and rapid price declines 
the company s success will continue to depend primarily on its ability to continue to reduce costs through manufacturing efficiencies and price negotiation with suppliers  the continued market acceptance of its existing products and its ability to develop and introduce new products 
there can be no assurance that televideo will successfully develop new products or that the new products it develops will be introduced in a timely manner and receive substantial market acceptance 
there can also be no assurance that product transitions will be managed in such a way to minimize inventory levels and product obsolescence of discontinued products 
the company s operating results could be adversely affected if televideo is unable to manage all aspects of product transitions successfully 
the company generally utilizes standard parts and components available from multiple suppliers 
however  certain parts and components used in the company s products are available from a single source 
if  contrary to its expectations  the company is unable to obtain sufficient quantities of any single sourced components  the company will experience delays in product shipments 
the company offers its products through various channels of distribution 
changes in the financial condition of  or in the company s relationship with  its distributors could cause actual operating results to vary from those expected 
also  the company s customers generally order products on an as needed basis 
therefore  virtually all product shipments in a given fiscal quarter result from orders received in that quarter 
the company anticipates that the rate of new orders will vary significantly from month to month 
the company s manufacturing plans and expenditure levels are based primarily on sales forecasts 
consequently  if anticipated sales and shipments in any quarter do not occur when expected  expenditure and inventory levels could be disproportionately high and the company s operating results for that quarter  and potentially future quarters  would be adversely affected 
the market price of televideo s common stock could be subject to fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  changes in analysts earnings estimates  market conditions in the computer technology industry  as well as general economic conditions and other factors external to the company 
subsequent events none
