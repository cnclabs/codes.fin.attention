item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company was founded in june to develop and commercialize feds 
since its inception  the company has been a development stage company devoting a majority of its resources to raising capital  conducting research and development activities  forming an alliance of industrial partners the fed alliance and establishing manufacturing capabilities for its feds 
to date  most of the company s revenues have been cooperation and license revenues under agreements with members of the fed alliance and revenues from funding under grants from the french government and the european union 
in the future  the company expects to generate its revenue primarily from the sale of products manufactured by unipac optoelectronics corp 
unipac under a contract manufacturing arrangement signed in may the company does not anticipate receiving any significant revenues from the sale of its products until the commencement of volume production which is not expected before the second half of in view of the development stage of the company and the current transition from revenues solely from the fed alliance to the addition of product sales revenues  the company believes that historical financial results are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
the company s expectations regarding its sources of future revenue are forward looking statements 
the amount  time and source of revenue generation will be affected by numerous matters including the availability of funds to finance its activities until volume shipments of products begin  the continued development of the company s products  including the enhancement of the display performance and the cost effective reproduction of the favorable characteristics demonstrated by the company s current prototypes in the context of commercial production  the successful transition of the company s prototype manufacturing processes to commercial manufacturing processes to achieve commercially viable yields  the successful development of a volume supply of fed products under contract manufacturing  the successful commercialization of feds by other members of the fed alliance  and the successful development of sufficient market demand for the company s products 
the company s products and its manufacturing processes are still in the early stages of development and testing 
to date  the company has only shipped limited quantities of products incorporating fed technology 
the company s only commercially available display is a inch monochrome display which to date has been sold in limited quantities to more than one hundred customers 
to date  among the members of the fed alliance  only futaba has announced the availability of commercial products in limited quantities 
pursuant to a license agreement with the commissariat a l energie atomique cea  the french atomic agency  the company is obligated to make royalty payments on its product sales and to pass through a portion of certain up front license fees earned after and royalties on sales of products by the company and such sublicensees the leti license agreement 
pursuant to an amendment to the leti license agreement signed in october the cea amendment  the royalty rates and minimum payments from the company to cea were temporarily increased for a period of three years 
an amount of million  reflected under the caption cost of revenues  license fees and royalties was accrued in with respect to such royalties and pass through expenses payable to cea 
a royalty amount of  and  was accrued in and in  respectively see notes to consolidated financial statements note nrelated party transactions 
all of the company s expenses to date  except royalties and pass through expenses payable to cea and tax expenses directly associated with revenues from fed alliance members  have been recorded as operating expenses  since the company has not shipped products in quantities sufficient to determine a meaningful cost of products sold category 
the company has incurred cumulative losses of million from inception to december  the company has incurred operating losses every quarter since inception  except during the three month period ending december   and expects to incur additional operating losses 
the magnitude and duration of the company s losses will depend on a number of factors within and outside of the company s control  including the company s ability to expand the fed alliance and the rate at which it can successfully manufacture and commercialize its feds  if at all  and the related costs of such efforts 
successful commercialization of such displays will in turn depend on a number of factors  including the successful development of sufficient market demand for the company s products 
results of operations cooperation and license revenues 
the company recognized cooperation and license revenues under the fed alliance agreements of million in  million in and million in the decrease in cooperation and license revenues reflects the achievement by the company at the end of of most of the contractual milestones with fed alliance members 
the company does pixtech annual report not expect any significant additional milestone related revenues to be directly derived from fed existing alliance members 
in  the company recorded cooperation and license revenues in the amount of million under the cooperation and license agreement with texas instruments executed on june  and terminated on july  to the extent the members of the fed alliance successfully incorporate the cross licensed technology in their own products  the company will recognize royalty revenues as such members sell the products 
product sales 
the company recognized product sales of  in   in and  in these product sales represented the shipment of fed displays and fed cathodes in limited quantities to members of the fed alliance and the shipment of fed displays for evaluation by original equipment manufacturer oem customers 
while the number of displays shipped significantly increased between and  the average selling price was reduced  reflecting a different mix between high valued prototypes and cathodes revenues and displays revenues 
the company expects to increase product shipments in  both from products manufactured at its pilot production plant in france and from its expected volume source of manufacturing by unipac  which is not expected to begin until the second half of other revenues 
other revenues is comprised of funding under french or european union development contracts and other miscellaneous revenues 
other revenues were  in  million in and million in of these revenues   and  are related to a development contract granted in december from the french ministry of industry to support manufacturing of feds  in and  respectively 
total potential funding under this contract is approximately million 
the company recognizes portions of this revenue as contractual conditions are met 
at december  and  deferred revenues in the amount of million and million  respectively  were included in non current liabilities under this agreement 
other revenues recorded in also included an insurance refund in the amount of  covering lost revenue after certain physical damages occurred in the company s pilot manufacturing facility in april research and development expenses acquisition of intellectual property rights 
the company expensed million in for the acquisition of intellectual property rights from certain members of the fed alliance 
no such expenses were recorded in other research and development expenses 
other research and development expenses include obligations to the french atomic energy agency under the leti research agreement  contract consulting fees  salaries and associated operating expenses for in house research and development activities conducted both in its pilot plant in montpellier and its research and development facility in santa clara  the cost of staffing and operating the company s pilot manufacturing facility and the cost of supporting the transfer of the fed technology to unipac 
other research and development expenses decreased from million in to million in this decrease in research and development expenses reflected the increase of the parity of the us dollar versus the french franc in versus  as most of the company s research and development costs is incurred in french francs 
after excluding the effects of currency fluctuation  research and development expenses increased by in as compared to  reflecting the continued development of the company s research and development efforts and fed technology and manufacturing processes 
other research and development expenses amounted to million in other research and development expenses included expenses recorded under the leti research agreement of million in   in  and  in sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in this increase reflected the expansion of the company s sales and marketing organization both in the united states and in europe  and the increasing support of marketing efforts through trade show attendance and advertising 
sales and marketing expenses amounted to million in  a decrease of on sales and marketing expenses which amounted to million  reflecting the reallocation of a limited number of engineers from sales and marketing to research and development 
the company believes sales and marketing expenses may increase in the future  as potential customers and anticipated shipments of fed displays develop 
in july  the company signed a distribution agreement of its fed products with sumitomo corporation sumitomo for the japanese and asian market areas 
in  the company intends to progress on its efforts to conclude similar distribution agreements for both the united states and europe  in order to expand market reach in a cost effective manner 
such expectation regarding increased product shipments and customer contracts is a forward looking statement  the fulfillment of which is dependent on numerous factors 
see item business strategy 
in addition  in order to achieve its objectives  the company will need to expand its business rapidly and add sales  marketing  manufacturing  administrative and management personnel  as well as establish and manage its international operations 
pixtech annual report general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses amounted to million in  a decrease of over general and administrative expenses incurred in  which amounted to million  reflecting the effects of currency fluctuation and a decrease in staff expenses and discretionary expenses 
general and administrative expenses amounted to million in interest income expense  net 
interest income is comprised of interest on cash and short term investments 
interest expense is comprised of interest payable on long term obligations 
net interest expense was  in  while the company recorded a net interest income of  in  as compared to  in  as the effect of increasing cash balances outweighed the effect of the increase in long term liabilities 
currency fluctuations 
although a significant portion of the company s revenues are denominated in us dollars  a substantial portion of the company s operating expenses are denominated in french francs 
gains and losses on the conversion to us dollars of assets and liabilities denominated in french francs may contribute to fluctuations in the company s results of operations  which are reported in us dollars 
the company recorded net foreign exchange gains of  in   in and  in the company cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on future operating results 
to date  the company has not undertaken hedging transactions to cover its currency exposure  but it may do so in the future 
income tax 
the company has recognized french income tax benefits of million since inception  including million in and  in these income tax benefits represent tax credits for research and development activities conducted in france and the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards  net of valuation allowance 
as of december   a valuation allowance of million was provided against a net deferred tax asset of million 
the tax credits for research and development activities will be paid in cash to the company if the company is not able to credit them against future income tax liabilities within three fiscal years 
in  the company collected  representing income tax benefit recorded in in  the company expects to receive million  representing income tax benefits recorded in and the company does not expect to record significant additional tax credits for research and development activities  if any  in the foreseeable future  as the benefit is based on increases in eligible research and development expenses in a given year over the two previous fiscal years 
as of december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards in france of approximately million of which million  million  million will expire in  and  respectively  if they are not utilized

in the past  these fluctuations have been caused by a variety of factors  including the success of the company in entering into new fed alliance agreements  achieving revenue producing milestones under the fed alliance agreements  and the rate of growth of the company s research and development activities 
liquidity and capital resources the company has used million in cash to fund its operations from inception through december   and million in capital expenditures and investments 
through december   the company has funded its operations and capital expenditures primarily from sales of million of equity securities and million of proceeds from borrowings and sale leaseback transactions 
in  the company used million in cash to fund its operations 
capital expenditures were million in and million in in  capital expenditures were primarily for leasehold improvements  facility expansion  and equipment installed in its pilot manufacturing facility  while capital expenditures remained focused on limited capacity expansion 
as of december   the company had commitments for capital expenditures of approximately  investments amounted to million in and are related to the security interest granted by the company to its asian partner  unipac  pursuant to the display foundry agreement the foundry agreement signed in may between the company and unipac in order to implement volume production of feds 
implementing volume production at unipac s manufacturing plant will require significant capital expenditures 
an amount of million of capital expenditures is expected to be required which  pursuant to the foundry agreement  is expected to be purchased and funded by unipac 
the written bank guaranty provided by the company to unipac is expected to be increased from million to million 
the company has existing contracts with two different french ministries providing for the payment of grants to the company totaling approximately million  of which the company has collected an aggregate amount of million pixtech annual report through december  and for which the company has recognized revenues to date in the aggregate amount of million 
in  the company entered into a research and development agreement with the european union and other european industrial companies for an month period  which began in february the contribution of the european union to the costs incurred by the company amounts to  over the period 
the company received  in from this contribution  which were not recognized as income in as all conditions stipulated in the agreement were not met 
cash flows generated from financing activities were million in  as compared to million used in financing activities in these financings consisted primarily of sales of shares of common stock in a public offering in europe and in private placements  resulting in net proceeds to the company of million net of issuance costs and million  respectively  while long term liabilities increased by million  as the company was granted a million loan by the japanese firm sumitomo in november see notes to consolidated financial statements note long term debt 
cash flow generated from financing activities exclude non cash transactions related to the sale of  shares of the company s common stock to motorola  inc see notes to consolidated financial statements note stockholders equity 
as consideration for this stock purchase  an amount of  has been received in cash and the remaining million was in the form of forgiveness of obligations due from the company to motorola 
the company believes that cash available at december  together with anticipated proceeds during from the various grants described above and the anticipated increase in product sales will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements  including repayment of the current portion of its long term obligations in the amount of million at december   for at least months 
the company will require substantial funds to conduct research  development and testing  to develop and expand commercial scale manufacturing systems and to market any resulting products 
changes in technology or a growth of sales beyond currently anticipated levels will also require further investment 
the company s capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate at which the company can develop its products  the market acceptance of such products  the levels of promotion and advertising required to launch such products and attain a competitive position in the marketplace and the response of competitors to the company s products 
there can be no assurance that funds for these purposes  whether from equity or debt financing  or other sources  will be available when needed or on terms acceptable to the company 
outlook issues and risks the company is focused on the continued development of the fed technology  the strengthening and expansion of the fed alliance  the improvement of manufacturing yields  the successful implementation of contract manufacturing of feds with its asian partner  unipac  and the reliability testing of new products which the company expects will lead to the shipment of commercial products in the near future 
in evaluating this outlook  the following risks and issues  among others  which are common with development stage companies  should be considered 
risks associated with contract manufacturing of feds 
the company believes that its ability to commercialize medium to large volumes of feds is highly dependent on its ability to have feds manufactured by a major manufacturer in the amlcd industry 
in may  the company signed the foundry agreement with unipac  an amlcd manufacturer based in taiwan 
under the agreement  unipac has installed volume production equipment to produce feds at its manufacturing plant  and will begin production for exclusive delivery of fed displays to pixtech 
expectations about the timing of this manufacturing plan with unipac are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including the ease or difficulty of the transfer of the fed technology to unipac 
if such manufacturing plans are not implemented on a timely basis  the company will not be able to ship medium to large volumes of fed products  or to obtain a commercially acceptable cost for its fed displays 
if the company is unable to have its fed manufactured in a cost effective manner  the company would be materially adversely affected 
significant capital expenditure is required in order to install  at the contract manufacturers facility  equipment that is not common to the amlcd manufacturing process 
a total amount of million of capital expenditures is expected to be required which  pursuant to the foundry agreement  is expected to be purchased and funded by unipac 
the amount actually expended on capital expenditures could vary significantly depending upon numerous factors  including the inherent unpredictability of the total amount of a large scale capital expenditure program 
should the company be successful in implementing this contract manufacturing relationship  the company s reliance on a single contract manufacturer will involve several risks  including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required products  and reduced control over the price  timeliness of delivery  reliability and quality of finished products 
any inability to manage this contract manufacturing relationship or any circumstance that would cause the company to delay the shipment of its products would have an adverse effect on the company 
pixtech annual report products and manufacturing processes under development  need to obtain commercial yields  costs of products 
the company s products and its manufacturing processes are in the development stage 
the company has to date encountered a number of delays in the development of its products and manufacturing processes 
no assurance can be given that further delays will not occur 
the company does not plan to increase production from its pilot facility beyond low volume levels 
the company believes that contract manufacturing with unipac see risks associated with contract manufacturing of feds will make it possible to manufacture volume quantities of feds at commercially acceptable costs 
however  moving from pilot production to volume production involves a number of steps and challenges 
in particular  in order to demonstrate the low cost potential of its fed technology  the company will need to improve its manufacturing yields 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to implement processes for the manufacture of volume quantities of fed products at commercially viable cost levels or on a timely basis 
if such processes are not successfully implemented  the company would be adversely affected 
display performance enhancement 
key elements of display performance are brightness  and stability over time life time and reliability  as well as power efficiency 
pixtech is seeking to balance luminous efficiency with power efficiency to produce bright and low power consumption displays 
display reliability is heavily dependent upon the manufacturing process used in assembling the displays as well as upon the characteristics of the phosphors used on the anode 
in order to produce color displays that will provide the product life necessary for most applications  the company needs to make further advances in manufacturing processes 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to improve the reliability and life time of its color feds to achieve commercially acceptable performance  or on a timely basis 
if such displays performance enhancements are not successfully completed  the company could be adversely affected 
revenues from fed alliance members 
to date  the company has recorded most of the expected revenues associated with the achievement of contractual milestones under existing fed alliance agreements  and most future fed alliance milestone revenues are subject to expansion of the alliance 
expansion of the fed alliance is subject  in part  to matters beyond the company s control 
failure to expand the fed alliance could adversely affect the company 
competition and competing technologies 
the market for flat panel display products is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so in the future 
the market is currently dominated by products utilizing liquid crystal display lcd technology 
lcd technology has continued to improve  and there can be no assurance that advances in lcd technology will not overcome its current limitations 
in addition  as some of the basic fed technology is in the public domain  the company has a number of potential direct competitors developing fed displays 
in the event that efforts by the company s competitors result in the development of products that offer significant advantages over the company s products  the company could be adversely affected 
no assurance of market acceptance 
the potential size and timing of market opportunities targeted by the company and the members of the fed alliance are uncertain 
the company anticipates marketing its displays to oems  and its success will depend on whether oems select the company s products for incorporation into their products and upon their successful introduction of such products  as well as the successful commercialization of products developed by members of the fed alliance 
patents and protection of proprietary technology 
the company s ability to compete effectively with other companies will depend  in part  on the ability of the company to maintain the proprietary nature of its technology 
although the company has been granted  has filed applications for and has been licensed under a number of patents in the united states and other countries  there can be no assurance as to the degree of protection offered by these patents  as to the likelihood that pending patents will be issued or as to the validity or enforceability of any issued patents 
in addition  because of the developmental stage of the company  claims that the company s products infringe on the proprietary rights of others are more likely to be asserted after commencement of commercial sales incorporating the company s technology 
although the company believes that its products do not infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that other third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company or that such claims will not be successful 
there can also be no assurance that competitors will not infringe the company s patents 
even successful defense and prosecution of patent suits are both costly and time consuming 
an adverse outcome in a suit in which the company asserts its patent rights could result in the loss of such rights  and could subject the company to substantial costs and diversion of company resources 
pixtech annual report foreign exchange 
a large percentage of the company s net assets and of the company s costs is expressed in french francs 
fluctuations of the parity of the us dollar versus the french franc may cause significant foreign exchange gains or losses 
impact of year the company has conducted a comprehensive review of its computer systems to identify applications that could be affected by the year issue  and has developed an implementation plan to resolve the issue 
management does not expect these costs to have a significant impact on its financial position or results of operations 
other important factors which may impact upon the achievement of such goals and forward looking statements are set forth in exhibit to this form k  all of which are incorporated herein by reference 
no assurance may be given that the company s strategic goals and other forward looking statements discussed in this section and elsewhere in this form k will be achieved
