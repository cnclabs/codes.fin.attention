item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands  except per share amounts overview gables is a self administered and self managed real estate investment trust a reit focused within the multifamily industry in the sunbelt region of the united states 
gables operating performance relies predominantly on net operating income from its apartment communities 
gables net operating income is influenced by operating expenses and rental revenues  which are affected by the supply and demand dynamics within gables markets 
gables performance is also affected by the general availability and cost of capital and by its ability to develop and to acquire additional apartment communities with returns in excess of its blended cost of equity and debt capital 
gables objective is to increase shareowner value by being a dominant owner and operator of class a multifamily communities in the sunbelt region 
to achieve its objective  gables employs a number of strategies including operating high quality  well located assets in a diverse set of select sunbelt markets which have similar demographic characteristics such as diverse economies with projected job growth 
gables primary target customer is the more affluent renter by choice  which requires a focus on customer service through highly trained associates and the maintenance of gables assets to a high standard 
gables intends to grow cash flow from operating communities through innovative  proactive property management that focuses on resident satisfaction and retention  increases in rents and occupancy levels  and the control of operating expenses through improved economies of scale 
due to the cyclical nature of the real estate markets  gables has adopted an investment strategy based on strong local presence and expertise which will allow for growth in assets through both acquisition and development as warranted by underlying market fundamentals  and that will provide for both favorable initial returns and long term growth prospects 
gables believes the successful execution of these operating and investment strategies will result in consistent high quality growth in operating cash flow 
gables believes that it is well positioned to achieve its objective as a result of its long established presence as a fully integrated real estate management  development  construction and acquisition company in each of gables core markets for the past fifteen years 
gables believes that this long term  local market presence gives it a competitive advantage with regard to its ability to generate increased cash flow from property operations during different economic cycles and to new investment opportunities that involve site selection  market information and requests for entitlements and zoning petitions 
the core markets are geographically independent  rely on diverse economic foundations and have experienced job growth substantially above national averages 
gables recently entered the orlando market which has the common growth characteristics of the core markets 
portfolio wide occupancy levels have remained high and portfolio wide rental rates have continued to increase during each of the last several years 
gables expects portfolio wide rental expenses to increase at a rate slightly ahead of inflation  but less than the increase in property revenues  for the coming twelve months 
in certain situations  management s evaluation of the growth prospects for a specific asset may result in a determination to dispose of the asset 
in this event  management would intend to sell the asset and utilize the net proceeds from any such sale to invest in new assets which are expected to have better growth prospects or to reduce indebtedness 
gables maintains staffing levels sufficient to meet the existing construction  acquisition  and leasing activities 
if market conditions warrant  management would anticipate adjusting staffing levels to mitigate a negative impact on results of operations

page management s discussion and analysis dollars in thousands  except per share amounts book value of assets and equity the application of historical cost accounting in accordance with gaap for gables upreit structure results in an understatement of total assets and equity compared to the amounts that would be recorded via the application of purchase accounting in accordance with gaap had gables not been organized as an upreit 
management believes it is imperative to understand this difference when evaluating the book value of assets and equity 
the understatement of basis related to this difference in organizational structure at december  is  exclusive of the effect of depreciation 
accordingly  on a pro forma basis  the real estate assets before accumulated depreciation  total assets and total shareholders equity plus minority interest of unitholders in the operating partnership as of december  would be   and  respectively  if such  value was reflected 
inflation substantially all of gables leases at the communities are for a term of one year or less  which may enable gables to seek increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or commencement of new leases in times of rising prices 
the short term nature of these leases generally serves to lessen the impact of cost increases arising from inflation 
certain factors affecting future operating results this report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the words believe  expect  anticipate  intend  estimate  assume and other similar expressions which are predictions of or indicate future events and trends and which do not relate solely to historical matters identify forward looking statements 
reliance should not be placed on forward looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors  which are in some cases beyond the control of gables and may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of gables to differ materially from anticipated future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  the following gables may fail to secure or abandon development opportunities  construction costs of a community may exceed original estimates  construction and lease up may not be completed on schedule  resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs and reduced rental revenues  occupancy rates and market rents may be adversely affected by local economic and market conditions which are beyond management s control  financing may not be available  or may not be available on favorable terms  gables cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest  and existing indebtedness may mature in an unfavorable credit environment  preventing such indebtedness from being refinanced  or  if financed  causing such refinancing to occur on terms that are not as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness 
other matters gables has assessed the impact of the year issue on its computer systems and is in the process of remediating the affected hardware and software 
the year issue is the result of many computer programs recognizing a date ending with as the year rather than the year  causing potential system failures or miscalculations which could result in disruptions of normal business operations 
gables primary financial and operating systems are supplied by third party suppliers and its hardware and software systems are either currently year compliant or will be compliant well in advance of january  gables costs of addressing the year issue are not expected to be material and will relate primarily to costs of existing information system personnel 
page management s discussion and analysis dollars in thousands  except per share amounts supplemental discussion funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations gables considers funds from operations ffo to be a useful performance measure of the operating performance of an equity reit because  together with net income and cash flows  ffo provides investors with an additional basis to evaluate the ability of a reit to incur and service debt and to fund acquisitions and other capital expenditures 
gables believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of its operating results  ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the financial statements and data included elsewhere in this report 
gables computes ffo in accordance with standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit 
ffo as defined by nareit represents net income loss determined in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of assets or debt restructuring  plus certain non cash items  primarily real estate depreciation  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo presented herein is not necessarily comparable to ffo presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition 
however  gables ffo is comparable to the ffo of real estate companies that use the nareit definition 
adjusted funds from operations affo is defined as ffo less capital expenditures funded by operations 
ffo and affo should not be considered as alternatives to net income as indicators of gables operating performance or as alternatives to cash flows as measures of liquidity 
ffo does not measure whether cash flow is sufficient to fund all of gables cash needs including principal amortization  capital expenditures  and distributions to shareholders and unitholders 
additionally  ffo does not represent cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as defined by gaap 
reference is made to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of gables cash needs and cash flows
