item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company creates  develops  produces and distributes high quality  family oriented animated television programming 
historically  the company has produced substantially all of its programming for third parties on a fee for services basis 
fees paid to the company for these production services generally range from  to  per episode and typically cover all direct production costs plus a profit margin 
the company has begun to produce programming for which it controls some of the proprietary rights associated with such programming including  for example  international distribution and licensing and merchandising rights 
fees paid to the company for these production services typically do not cover all direct production costs 
generally  the company seeks to cover at least of its production costs prior to production of its proprietary programs and seeks to cover the remaining production costs through the exploitation of the proprietary rights associated with these programs 
as a result  the company may recognize revenue associated with its proprietary programming over a period of years 
the company produces a limited number of animated television series in any year and is substantially dependent on revenues from licensing these programs to broadcasters 
the company s future performance will be affected by issues facing all producers of animated programming  including risks related to the limited number of time slots allocated to children s and or animated television programming  the intense competition for those time slots  the limited access to distribution channels particularly for programs produced by independent studios  the declining license fees paid to producers of programming by broadcasters and the regulations implemented by the federal communications commission governing program content 
while the company seeks to limit its financial risk associated with its proprietary programming by obtaining commitments prior to production to cover at least of its direct production costs  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to cover the balance of its production costs and overhead costs relating to production  licensing and distribution through the exploitation of its proprietary rights 
as a result of the foregoing risks  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to generate revenues that exceed its costs 
the company is currently seeking to enter into new business areas beyond its core business of animation television production such as live action television production  feature film production both live action and animation and direct to video production both live action and animation 
the company s future performance will be affected by unpredictable and changing factors that influence the success of an individual television program  feature film or direct to video release such as personal taste of the public and critics as well as public awareness of a production and the successful distribution of a production 
although the company intends to attempt to limit the risks involved with television  film and direct to video production  the company will likely be unable to limit all financial risk  and the level of marketing  promotional and distribution activities and expenses necessary for such production cannot be predicted with certainty 
the company has no history of developing  producing or distributing live action television or film productions  and there can be no assurance that the company can compete successfully with more established persons or entities 
live action production involves many of the risks associated with animation production as well as additional risks inherent to live action that are outside of the company s control 
these risks include  but are not limited to  the risk of strike by actors and film crew  increased union activity  delay in production due to weather and other local conditions  inability to obtain proper permitting at a desired site  at desired times and or under desired terms  and accidents or injury to actors and film crew 
no assurance can be given that the company will produce any live action television  film or direct to video productions or that  if produced  such productions will be profitable 
in the first quarter of  the company decided to reduce its fixed overhead by outsourcing its licensing and merchandising  public relations  promotion  and advertising to third party suppliers 
the company will consider bringing these functions in house again  should the volume indicate that such action would be prudent 
blues brothers the animated series the company put its proprietary production of blues brothers the animated series the blues brothers into hiatus in march following discussions between the company and united paramount network upn with respect to certain creative aspects of the project 
although in august upn announced its intention to run the series in the fall of  the network subsequently changed its programming strategy to de emphasize prime time animation  which led to upn s decision in september to cancel its plans to air the blues brothers 
in september  upn and the company entered into a settlement whereby upn compensated the company for a portion of the costs associated with the production of the show 
the company s investment amounted to approximately million as of december   and the company recorded a write off for the year ended december   of approximately million 
revenue and cost recognition the company follows fasb for accounting practices related to revenue recognition and amortization of production costs for its fee for services and proprietary programming 
revenues from license and production agreements  which may provide for the receipt by the company of nonrefundable guaranteed amounts  are recognized when the license period begins and the programming is available pursuant to the terms of the agreement  typically when the finished episode has been delivered to or made available to and accepted by the customer 
amounts in excess of minimum guarantees under such agreements are recognized when earned 
cash collected in advance of the time of availability of programming is recorded as deferred revenue million at december  
all costs incurred in connection with an individual program or film  including acquisition  development  production and allocable production overhead costs and interest are capitalized as film costs 
at december   the company s capitalized film costs balance was million 
these costs are stated at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value 
estimated total production costs for an individual program or film are amortized in the proportion that revenue realized relates to management s estimate of the total revenue expected to be received from such program or film 
estimated liabilities for third party participations are accrued and expensed in the same manner as film costs are amortized 
due to the inherent uncertainties of forecasting both total revenue and total expense  at any time one or the other can be overstated or understated  resulting in potential adjustments to the amortization rate or net realizable value calculation 
the company s cash flows are not necessarily related to revenue recognition and amortization of production costs 
cash is received and costs are incurred and paid throughout the year 
in the fourth quarter  and to a lesser extent the third quarter  cash used in operations typically exceeds cash generated by operations as completed shows are delivered to broadcasters  however  this may be offset by collections for sales of the company s shows in international markets 
overhead allocation overhead is allocated to particular productions on the basis of the total allocable overhead times the ratio of direct production costs incurred on a program to total production costs incurred during the period 
total allocable overhead is determined on the basis of management s estimates of the percentage of overhead costs which can be attributed to the productions in progress during the period 
income taxes prior to august   the company was an s corporation subject to taxation under subchapter s of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
as a result  the net income of the company  for federal and some state income tax purposes  was reported by and taxed directly to the company s sole stockholder  rather than the company 
the company s s corporation status terminated on august  and the company became a c corporation subject to corporate taxation 
no provision for income taxes has been recorded by the company since august   as the company has only recorded losses since that date 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  total revenue decreased by  or million  to million for the year ended december   from million for the prior year 
total revenue decreased primarily because the company delivered significantly fewer episodes of programming in as compared to the company delivered a total of episodes of programming for the year ended december  as compared to episodes delivered in the company delivered fee for services episodes during the year ended december   compared to episodes in fee for services revenue increased  or million  to million for the year ended december   from million in as a result of delivering more prime time episodes which generally generate higher per episode fees than saturday morning episodes 
the company delivered proprietary episodes for the year ended december   compared to episodes in proprietary revenue consists of revenue derived from the us license fees paid upon the initial delivery of a new episode of proprietary programming to a us broadcaster and from the exploitation of the proprietary rights eg  merchandising  licensing and or international distribution rights associated with the proprietary episodes in the company s library that were initially delivered in prior periods 
proprietary revenue decreased by  or million  to million for the year ended december   from million in this decrease was a result of significantly fewer proprietary episodes being delivered partially offset by million in revenue from the blues brothers settlement with upn and continued international sales of the company s library programming 
other revenue decreased by approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to the prior year  due primarily to lower revenues from commercials and specials  interactive revenues and net profit participations 
total cost of revenue decreased by  or million  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  total cost of revenue as a percentage of sales remained constant at for both and total selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased by million to million from million for the comparable period in  due primarily to increased professional fees  the write off of certain development costs and ongoing costs of operating a public company 
operating loss was million for the year ended december   as compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  year ended december  compared with year ended december  total revenues for the year ended december  increased by to million from million in  primarily due to the delivery of more episodes 
in the company delivered episodes compared to episodes in  an increase of episodes or a increase 
episodic revenue increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  for the four series that were produced and delivered in both and  fewer episodes were delivered in than in  while revenue for such series decreased by million 
the company produced two series in episodes which were not renewed in  resulting in a revenue decrease of million  and added five new series episodes in  resulting in an additional million in revenue 
total other revenue increased by million in compared to  primarily due to million of revenue associated with the interactive division 
total costs of revenue increased by million to million in from million in included in costs of revenue are episodic costs which increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for for the four series that were produced in both and  fewer episodes were delivered in  while costs for such series declined by million 
costs decreased by million as a result of the two series which were not renewed in  while costs increased by million as a result of the five new series in included in the episodic costs of the new series were the cost of two proprietary series for which the company sustained significant write downs 
c bear jamal was not renewed for its saturday morning time slot  although fox children s network has agreed to repeat the original episodes on friday mornings 
the company recorded million more in costs than revenue for this series for the year ended december  bruno the kid  which is currently in syndication  received significantly lower ratings and worse time slots than originally projected  resulting in lower domestic revenue to the company which was a primary factor in the company s reporting million more in costs than revenue on this series for the year ended december  other costs increased by million primarily as a result of million of costs associated with the interactive division and a million increase in costs associated with ancillary revenue 
total selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to million in from million in  primarily due to increased costs related to the expansion of the company s licensing and merchandising division million  interactive division million and rent and salaries million and a decreased cost in the international division million 
as a percentage of total revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in liquidity and capital resources greater capital resources are required for the company to develop and produce proprietary programs  retain the proprietary rights associated with such programs  and increase its presence in the licensing and merchandising and international distribution markets 
the company seeks to limit the financial risk associated with its proprietary programming by obtaining commitments prior to production to cover at least of its direct production costs  but the company must utilize its own funds to cover remaining production costs and overhead costs relating to production  licensing and distribution 
the company seeks to cover the remaining production costs through the exploitation of the proprietary rights associated with the programs in its library eg  international distribution rights and or merchandising  and licensing 
historically  in the fourth quarter  and to a lesser extent the third quarter  cash used in operations typically exceeded cash generated by operations as completed shows were delivered to broadcasters 
however  the company has begun to exploit  to a greater extent  the international distribution rights associated with the proprietary programs in its library 
as a result  the company expects that cash used in or provided by operations will fluctuate greatly from quarter to quarter  due in part  to the international sales and collections cycle related to the programs in its library 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million due to non cash amortization of film cost being greater than cash spent on film cost additions and cash generated in connection with a decrease in accounts receivable  offset by fluctuations in other operating assets and liabilities 
for the year ended december   net cash used for investing activities was million due to additions to property and equipment 
the company had minimal financing activities during management believes that the company s cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund the company s operating requirements for at least the next year 
impact of year some of the company s older computer programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  those computer programs have time sensitive software that recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could cause a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has begun an assessment and will have to modify or replace portions of its software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the total year project cost  including the cost of modifying the computer software  is not expected to be material 
the project is estimated to be completed not later than december   which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
the company believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed on a timely basis  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
forward looking statements this report contains certain forward looking statements  relating to  among other things  future results of operations  growth plans  plans to enter into new business areas beyond the company s core business of animation television production  anticipated production  revenue and expense trends and general industry and business conditions applicable to the company 
these forward looking statements are based largely on the company s current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from these forward looking statements 
important factors to consider in evaluating such forward looking statements include changes in external competitive market factors  changes in the company s business strategy or an inability to execute its strategy due to unanticipated changes in the animation industry or the economy in general  a reduction in the availability of time slots for animated programming  a further increase in the vertical integration of the production and distribution of animation and various other competitive factors that may prevent the company from competing successfully in existing or future markets 
in light of these risks and uncertainties  many of which are described in greater detail in item business risks related to the business  there can be no assurance that the forward looking statements contained in this report will in fact be realized
