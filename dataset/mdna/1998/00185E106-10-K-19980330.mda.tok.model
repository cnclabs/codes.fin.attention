the company was successful in decreasing its concentration of business with its two largest clients in fiscal by increasing net revenue from other clients by during the year 
sales solutions net revenue increased by million during fiscal of this increase  approximately was attributable to services initiated for new clients  while the balance was due to higher call volumes from existing clients 
the million increase in service solutions net revenue during fiscal was due to services initiated for new clients and the inclusion of paragren s software and consulting revenue 
revenue from existing service solutions clients was unchanged for the year as increased revenue from higher inbound call volumes with an existing large telecommunications client was offset by a revenue reduction from the company s large parcel delivery client 
the revenue reduction from the large parcel delivery client was due to improved operating efficiencies in the management of client owned call centers and the effects of a three week labor strike against the client 
cost of services as a percent of net revenue increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase was due to four factors 
first  the company experienced lower margins as a result of client mix and marketplace pricing pressures 
second  a more expensive group health insurance plan was implemented during fiscal to improve employee retention 
third  the company s large parcel delivery client reduced the number of billable positions in the client owned call centers by approximately  resulting in the company absorbing payroll costs during a three month adjustment period that otherwise would have been billed to the client 
finally  the company absorbed fixed costs relating to excess capacity and infrastructure  such fixed costs increasing as a percent of net revenue  due to marketing related volume reductions by its large telecommunications client and the effects of a labor strike against the large parcel delivery client 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of million or 
as a percent of net revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses during fiscal was due to expansion of sales and marketing efforts  investments in human resources and administrative functions to support the company s larger revenue base  and the inclusion of paragren s selling  general and administrative expenses 
the expenses of paragren are higher per dollar of revenue than the company s expenses due to sales and marketing and research and development required to support software sales and consulting efforts 
special charges recorded during fiscal included the write off of acquired in process research and development of million in connection with the paragren purchase and a provision for software impairment of million as a result of plans to replace software platforms used by the company with technologies being developed by paragren 
acquired in process research and development  which was determined by an independent appraisal  includes the value of software in the development stage and not considered to have reached technological feasibility 
generally accepted accounting principles require that research and development costs be expensed as incurred 
net interest expense increased by million in fiscal from fiscal this increase reflects interest income earned on temporary investments in fiscal with cash raised in the initial public offering of the company s common shares compared to interest expense incurred on outstanding borrowings in fiscal as the result of investment in customer optimization centers during the fourth quarter of fiscal and fiscal the effective income tax rate in fiscal increased to from in fiscal principally due to the special charge to operations for acquired in process research and development related to the paragren purchase for which no tax benefit was available 
the effective income tax rate in fiscal before the impact of acquired in process research and development was 
the change between the actual income tax rate in fiscal and the adjusted income tax rate in fiscal was due to the amortization of goodwill related to the paragren purchase and other non deductible expenses 
the cumulative effect of the accounting change of million  net of applicable income taxes  reflects the adoption during fiscal of emerging issues task force bulletin no 
eitf no 
 accounting for the costs incurred in connection with a consulting contract or an internal project that combines business process reengineering and information technology transformation 
eitf no 
requires that business process reengineering costs be expensed as incurred and that any unamortized reengineering costs at november   also be expensed and reported as a cumulative effect of accounting change 
the company had been capitalizing reengineering costs related to the installation of computer software purchased to provide enterprise wide business management systems 
fiscal compared to fiscal net revenue increased in fiscal to million  up million from fiscal service solutions net revenue increased by million during fiscal this increase principally was due to the commencement of a four year agreement to manage client owned call centers for a large parcel delivery client 
sales solutions net revenue increased by million during fiscal of this increase  approximately was attributed to services initiated for new clients  principally outbound call activity for a large telecommunications client  while the balance was due to higher call volumes from existing clients 
cost of services as a percent of net revenue decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal exclusive of start up activities related to new parcel delivery business  cost of services as a percent of net revenue increased by in fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase reflects the shift in service mix to the management of client owned call centers 
the management of client owned call centers has a lower gross margin compared to the company s other service offerings because of the nature of the outsourced services provided for the large parcel delivery client 
recruiting  training and facility costs incurred in advance of full scale operations of new customer optimization centers during fiscal also contributed to the higher service costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal to million  up million over fiscal approximately of the growth in overhead was due to investments in additional management personnel and systems to support the company s increased revenue base  with the balance due to expenses associated with the new parcel delivery business 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of net revenue declined as a result of economies of scale associated with spreading fixed and semi variable costs over a larger revenue base 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of net revenue were for fiscal compared to for fiscal net interest expense decreased million from fiscal to fiscal the decrease was due to a reduction of average outstanding borrowings as a result of debt retired in fiscal with cash raised from the initial public offering of the company s common shares in october the provision for income taxes of million recognized in fiscal was based upon the company s estimated effective tax rate of 
prior to the initial public offering of the company s common shares in fiscal  the company included its income and expenses with those of its share owners for federal and certain state income tax purposes an s corporation election

the pro forma income tax rate of in fiscal assumed that the company was treated as a c corporation for the entire year and reflects federal taxes at the statutory rate of plus state taxes  net of federal benefit and state job creation credits 
the change between the pro forma income tax rate in fiscal and the actual income tax rate in fiscal was due to tax planning strategies which have reduced state income taxes payable

and eitf during fiscal and will adopt sfas nos 
and in fiscal as of december   the impact of adopting sfas nos 
and has not been determined

liquidity and capital resources the following table sets forth consolidated statements of cash flows data for the company for years ended december   december   and december  cash flows data in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used by investing activities net cash provided by financing activities cash provided by operating activities during fiscal totaled million  up million over fiscal and million over fiscal income adjusted for non cash items amounted to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in cash provided by operations in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to a decrease in cash required for general working capital purposes as a result of slower revenue growth in than in cash from investing activities was used to expand the number of customer optimization centers and to standardize and upgrade the company s telecommunications and business management systems 
capital expenditures amounted to million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in capital expenditures in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to the construction of sales solutions centers and service solutions centers with a combined capacity of  seats 
new capacity was added during to meet the service needs of a large telecommunications client and to position the company for growth in the decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to the utilization of capacity placed into service at the end of and slower revenue growth in than in capital expenditures in fiscal included million to standardize and upgrade the company s technology platform and business management systems 
funds required for capital investment over the past two years were provided by the sale of million in short term investments  borrowings under the company s credit facility described below and excess cash from operations 
cash from financing activities during the last three fiscal years was provided by proceeds from the sale of the company s common shares and borrowings under the company s credit facility 
on october   the company completed the initial public offering of common shares raising million for business growth and general working capital purposes 
cash distributions to share owners during fiscal and fiscal represent dividends to cover share owners income taxes related to the company s former s corporation status 
on august   the company completed the acquisition of paragren technologies  inc the purchase price was approximately million consisting of  shares of the company s common shares and stock options for an additional  shares of the company s common shares which resulted from the conversion of existing paragren stock options 
the paragren acquisition is expected to contribute positively to the company s operating results beginning in fiscal year in june   the company entered into a new unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of banks and repaid amounts outstanding under prior line of credit facilities 
in june  the company amended its credit facility increasing the total available line of credit from million to million 
as of december   the company had borrowings totaling million under the credit facility classified as current indebtedness  as amounts outstanding fluctuate based upon the working capital position of the company 
the company intends to use funds generated by future operations and available credit under its credit facility to meet normal operating needs as well as fund planned capital expenditures during fiscal quarterly results the company s operating results in any single period should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results as the services offered by the company are subject to variations in profitability 
the company could experience variations in net revenue and operating results due to result of many factors  including the timing of clients marketing campaigns and customer service programs  the timing of additional selling  general and administrative expenses to acquire and support such new business and changes in the company s revenue mix among its various service offerings 
in connection with certain contracts  the company could incur costs in periods prior to recognizing revenue under those contracts 
in addition  the company must plan its operating expenditures based on revenue forecasts  and a revenue shortfall below such forecast in any quarter would likely adversely affect the company s operating results for that quarter 
while the effects of seasonality on the company s business have historically been obscured by its growing net revenue  the company s business tends to be slower in the first and third quarters of its fiscal year due to client marketing programs which are typically slower in the postholiday and summer months 
year compliance the company recognizes the need to ensure its operations will not be adversely impacted by year software failures 
specifically  computational errors are a known risk with respect to dates after december  the company is in the process of assessing its computer and telecommunications equipment and internal computer applications to prepare for the year with its vendors 
although the company has not yet estimated the total costs needed for year compliance  the company currently believes it will be able to upgrade and maintain its computer systems to recognize years beginning with  and that the costs to do so will not have a material impact on its results of operations and financial position 
although the company is committed to making its systems year compliant as soon as practical  it is uncertain as to the extent its clients and vendors may be affected by year issues that require commitment of significant resources and may cause disruptions in the clients and vendors businesses 
information regarding forward looking statements certain statements in the foregoing management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this report  including those regarding apac s expected growth  prospective business opportunities and future expansion plans  constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  including  but not limited to  general economic and business conditions  competition  changing trends in customer profiles and changes in governmental regulations 
although the company believes that its expectations with respect to the forward looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its business and operations  there can be no assurance that actual results  performance or achievements of the company will not differ materially from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
in addition to the risks and uncertainties of ordinary business operations  the forward looking statements of the company contained in this annual report on form k are also subject to the following risks and uncertainties reliance on major clients because a substantial portion of the company s revenue is generated from relatively few clients  the loss of a significant client or clients could have a materially adverse effect on the company 
the company had clients which individually accounted for more than of the company s net revenue for fiscal  and the company s ten and four largest clients collectively accounted for and  respectively  of the company s net revenue in fiscal the company s largest clients in fiscal were a major parcel delivery company and a large telecommunications company  which accounted for and  respectively  of the company s net revenue in fiscal the company s third largest client in fiscal was mass marketing insurance group  which accounted for of the company s net revenue during that period 
the insurance products sold by mass marketing insurance group are currently underwritten by jc penney life insurance company 
during fiscal  jc penney life insurance company accounted for of the company s net revenue 
the company s fourth largest client in fiscal was canadian national bancorp which accounted for of the company s net revenue during the period 
in fiscal  two clients accounted for and of the company s net revenue and in fiscal  two clients accounted for and of the company s net revenue  respectively 
many of the company s clients are concentrated in the business and consumer products  parcel delivery  financial services  insurance  retail  technology  telecommunications and utilities industries 
a significant downturn in any of these industries or a trend in any of these industries not to use  or to reduce their use of  telephone based sales  marketing or customer management solutions could have a materially adverse effect on the company s business 
the company generally operates under contracts which may be terminated on short notice  most of which do not have minimum volume requirements 
factors affecting ability to manage and sustain growth the company has experienced rapid growth over the past several years and anticipates continued growth to be driven primarily by industry trends towards outsourcing of telephone based sales  marketing  and customer service operations and increased penetration by the company of new and existing clients and markets 
future growth will depend on a number of factors  including the effective and timely initiation and development of client relationships  opening of new customer optimization centers  and recruitment  motivation and retention of qualified personnel 
sustaining growth will also require the implementation of enhanced operational and financial systems and will require additional management  operational and financial resources 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage its expanding operations effectively or that it will be able to maintain or accelerate its growth 
competitive and fragmented industry  potential future competing technologies and trends the industry in which the company competes is extremely competitive and highly fragmented 
the company s competitors range in size from very small firms offering special applications or short term projects to large independent firms and the in house operations of many clients and potential clients 
a number of competitors have capabilities and resources equal to  or greater than  the company s 
some of the company s services also compete with direct mail  television  radio and other advertising media 
there can be no assurance that  as the company s industry continues to evolve  additional competitors with greater resources than the company will not enter the industry or particular segments of the industry or that the company s clients will not choose to conduct more of their telephone based sales  marketing or customer service activities internally 
the development of new forms of direct sales and marketing techniques  such as interactive home shopping through television  computer networks and other media  could have an adverse effect on the demand for the company s sales solutions services 
in addition  the increased use of new telephone based technologies  such as interactive voice response systems and increased use of the internet  could reduce the demand for certain of the company s service solutions offerings 
moreover  the effectiveness of marketing by telephone could also decrease as a result of consumer saturation and increased consumer resistance to this direct marketing tool 
although the company attempts to monitor industry trends and respond accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to anticipate and successfully respond to such trends in a timely manner 
reliance on technology the company has invested significantly in sophisticated and specialized telecommunications and computer technology  and has focused on the application of this technology to provide customized solutions to meet its clients needs 
the company anticipates that it will be necessary to continue to select  invest in and develop new and enhanced technology on a timely basis in the future in order to maintain its competitiveness 
the company s future success will depend in part on its ability to continue to develop information technology solutions which keep pace with evolving industry standards and changing client demands 
in addition  the company s business is highly dependent on its computer and telephone equipment and software systems  and the temporary or permanent loss of such equipment or systems  through casualty or operating malfunction  could have a materially adverse effect on the company s business 
dependence on key personnel the success of the company depends in large part upon the abilities and continued service of its executive officers and other key employees 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain the services of such officers and employees 
the loss of key personnel could have a materially adverse effect on the company 
the company has non competition agreements with certain of its existing key personnel 
however  courts are at times reluctant to enforce such agreements 
in order to support growth  the company will be required to effectively recruit  develop and retain additional qualified management personnel 
dependence on labor force the company s industry is very labor intensive and has experienced high personnel turnover 
many of the company s employees receive modest hourly wages and a significant number are employed on a part time basis 
a higher turnover rate among the company s employees would increase the company s recruiting and training costs and decrease operating efficiencies and productivity 
some of the company s operations  particularly insurance product sales and technology based inbound customer service  require specially trained employees 
growth in the company s business will require it to recruit and train qualified personnel at an accelerated rate from time to time 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to hire  train and retain a sufficient labor force of qualified employees 
a significant portion of the company s costs consists of wages to hourly workers 
an increase in hourly wages  costs of employee benefits or employment taxes could materially adversely effect the company 
dependence on telephone service the company s business is materially dependent on service provided by various local and long distance telephone companies 
a significant increase in the cost of telephone services that is not recoverable through an increase in the price of the company s services  or any significant interruption in telephone services  could have a materially adverse impact on the company 
government regulation the company s business is subject to various federal and state laws and regulations 
the company s industry has become subject to an increasing amount of federal and state regulation in the past five years 
the fcc rules under the tcpa limit the hours during which telemarketers may call consumers and prohibit the use of automated telephone dialing equipment to call certain telephone numbers 
the tcfapa broadly authorizes the ftc to issue regulations prohibiting misrepresentation in telemarketing sales 
in august  the ftc issued regulations under the tcfapa which  among other things  require telemarketers to make certain disclosures when soliciting sales 
the company s operating procedures comply with the telephone solicitation rules of the fcc and ftc 
however  there can be no assurance that additional federal or state legislation  or changes in regulatory implementation  would not limit the activities of the company or its clients in the future or significantly increase the cost of regulatory compliance 
several of the industries in which the company s clients operate are subject to varying degrees of government regulation  particularly the telecommunications  insurance and financial services industries 
generally  compliance with these regulations is the responsibility of the company s clients 
however  the company could be subject to a variety of enforcement or private actions for its failure or the failure of its clients to comply with such regulations 
the company s telephone representatives who sell insurance products are required to be licensed by various state insurance commissions and participate in regular continuing education programs  thus requiring the company to comply with the extensive regulations of these state commissions 
as a result  changes in these regulations or their implementation could materially increase the company s operating costs 
potential fluctuations in quarterly operating results the company could experience quarterly variations in revenues and operating income as a result of many factors  including the timing of clients marketing campaigns and customer service programs  the timing of additional selling  general and administrative expenses to acquire and support such new business and changes in the company s revenue mix among its various service offerings 
in connection with certain contracts  the company could incur costs in periods prior to recognizing revenue under those contracts 
in addition  the company must plan its operating expenditures based on revenue forecasts  and a revenue shortfall below such forecast in any quarter would likely adversely affect the company s operating results for that quarter 
the effects of seasonality on the company s business have historically been obscured by its growing net revenue 
however  the company s business tends to be slower in the first and third quarters due to client marketing programs which are typically slower in the post holiday and summer months 
control by principal share owner mr 
schwartz  the company s chairman  president and chief executive officer  beneficially owns approximately of the outstanding common shares 
as a result  mr 
schwartz is able to exercise significant control over the outcome of substantially all matters requiring action by the company s share owners 
such voting concentration may have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control of the company 
in addition  two trusts each beneficially own approximately of the outstanding common shares
