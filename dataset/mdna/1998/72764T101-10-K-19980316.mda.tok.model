liquidity and capital resources the company s cash  cash equivalents and investments were  and  as of december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   cash and cash equivalents increased  from  at the beginning of the year to  at the end of the year 
this increase was attributable primarily to net proceeds of  from the sale of  principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due the notes and net cash provided by operating activities of  the positive cash flow from operating activities was reduced by an increase in trade and installment receivables  net of proceeds from the sale of installment receivables 
previously  the company reported trade and installment receivables on a gross basis and the sale of installment receivables as a financing activity 
of the  of cash provided by financing and operating activities   was used in investing activities 
the principal components of investing activities were purchases of marketable securities and the investment of resources in purchased and developed software 
for  cash and cash equivalents increased from  at the beginning of the year to  at the end of the year  with the primary sources of cash being sales of installment receivables and the net proceeds from the sale of  principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due the notes 
for  cash and cash equivalents increased from  at the beginning of the year to  at the end of the year  with the principal source of cash being the net proceeds from a public offering of common stock 
in recent years  the company s sources of liquidity have primarily been funds from capital markets and sales of installment receivables 
the company believes the funding available to it from these sources  as well as cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future 
the company s capital requirements are primarily dependent on management s business plans regarding the levels and timing of investments in existing and newly acquired businesses and technologies 
these plans and the related capital requirements may change based upon various factors  such as the company s strategic opportunities  developments in the company s markets  the timing of closing and integrating acquisitions and the conditions of financial markets 
the company had trade and installment accounts receivable  net of allowances  of  and  as of december  and  respectively 
the company sells software products and services to customers in diversified industries and geographic regions and  therefore  has no significant concentration of credit risk 
historically  a substantial amount of the company s revenues have been recorded in the third month of any given quarter  with a concentration of such revenues in the last week of the third month 
this trend results in a high balance of accounts receivable relative to reported revenues at the end of any quarterly reporting period 
the company sells a significant portion of its installment receivables to third parties 
installment receivables represent amounts collectible on long term financing arrangements and include fees for product licenses  upgrades and maintenance  sometimes also bundled with professional services contracts 
installment receivables are generally financed over three to five years  with interest payable on the license and upgrade portions only 
over the past two years  the company executed an increasingly greater number and higher dollar value of sales transactions having long term financing arrangements  primarily attributable to sales of product bundles and integrated product suites 
consequently  the company s volume of installment receivable sales increased significantly over the past two years 
however  the company expects to reduce the volume of installment receivable sales  as a percentage of total revenues  in as compared to the company receives proceeds equal to the entire installment receivable balance sold to a third party finance company  net of an amount representing the interest to be earned by the finance company 
the finance company collects customer remittances over the term of the agreement 
proceeds from the sale of receivables were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
accounts receivable sold with recourse were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  and as of december  and  potential obligations for accounts receivable sold with recourse were  and  respectively 
there were no accounts receivable sold with recourse for the year ended december   and as of december   there were no remaining potential recourse obligations for accounts receivable sold with recourse 
the company has an agreement with a third party that provides for potential recourse obligations in the form of a loss pool based on the performance of the related accounts receivable portfolio 
under the terms of that agreement  potential recourse obligations at december  and were  and  respectively 
there were no potential recourse obligations in the form of a loss pool as of december  based on the credit ratings of the underlying obligors to the accounts receivable and the performance history of the accounts receivable portfolio  the company has assessed the exposure related to these recourse obligations and determined the potential liability to be minimal 
the company s installment receivables are recorded net of unamortized discounts and deferred maintenance fees 
when these receivables are sold  the company reduces the gross installment receivable balance 
additionally  the company reclassifies the deferred maintenance  which was previously reflected as a reduction of the related installment receivable balance  to an obligation 
the deferred maintenance is recognized into income ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement 
the company had long term acquisition related payables of  and  and other long term obligations of  and  as of december  and  respectively 
the significant increase in long term obligations from december  to december  was attributable to the notes issued by the company in december the notes bear interest at annually and mature on december  the holders of the notes have the option to convert them into shares of common stock  at any time prior to maturity  at a conversion price of per share 
the company received proceeds  net of issuance costs  of  from the offering of the notes 
the company completed an offering of convertible subordinated notes due november  in november the notes 
the notes bear interest at annually and the holders of the notes have the option to convert them into shares of common stock  at any time prior to maturity  at a conversion price of per share 
the company received proceeds  net of issuance costs  of  from the offering of the notes 
the company currently has total debt service obligations of approximately  for  consisting primarily of obligations to pay interest on the notes and the notes  as well as acquisition related payables 
based on current outstanding indebtedness  the company estimates its debt service requirements to be approximately    and  for   and  respectively  which amounts include the outstanding principal balance of the notes in and the outstanding principal balance of the notes in the company currently has an unsecured bank line of credit of  under which borrowings bear interest at rates ranging from approximately libor plus to the bank s prime rate 
as of march   the company had no outstanding borrowings under this line of credit  but had aggregate letters of credit outstanding for approximately  with expiration dates ranging from april to may these letters of credit reduce the available line of credit balance 
under this credit agreement  the company has agreed i to maintain a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of at least to  ii to maintain a tangible net worth of not less than  and iii not to permit its ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth to at any time exceed to foreign currency exchange rates to date  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material effect on the company s results of operations or liquidity 
however  the company closely monitors its foreign operations and net asset position to ascertain the need for hedging foreign currency exchange risk 
since  the only exposure related to foreign currency exchange for which the company has considered hedging appropriate has been related to short term intercompany balances 
these non functional currency balances are hedged by purchases and sales of forward exchange contracts to reduce this exchange rate exposure 
at december   the company held an aggregate of approximately  in notional amount of forward exchange contracts 
as the company s operations expand in international regions outside western europe  where the company s international operations are currently concentrated  the company may increasingly hedge foreign currency exchange risk 
year considerations during  the company substantially completed the implementation of an enterprise wide financial accounting system which is year compliant 
further  the company has evaluated its internal software and computer systems and believes its potential liability relating to the year problem is minimal 
the company believes that certain of its customers may allocate a substantial portion of their and it budgets to products and services addressing the year problem 
the company is unable to determine whether this trend will negatively impact sales of its traditional product offerings  but believes that it may lead to increased sales of its year products and services 
the company believes that  in  sales of its year products and services were favorably affected by this trend 
all of the company s current software product offerings are year compliant
