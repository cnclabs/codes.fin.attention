item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview arch is a leading provider of wireless messaging services  primarily paging services  and had million pagers in service as of december  from january  through december   the company s total subscriber base grew at a compound annual rate of and its compound annual rate of internal subscriber base growth excluding pagers added through acquisitions was 
arch derives the majority of its revenues from fixed periodic usually monthly fees  not dependent on usage  charged to subscribers for paging services 
as long as a subscriber remains on service  operating results benefit from the recurring payments of the fixed periodic fees without incurrence of additional selling expenses by arch 
arch s service  rental and maintenance revenues and the related expenses exhibit substantially similar growth trends 
arch s average revenue per subscriber has declined over the last three years as a result of two principal reasons i an increase in the number of subscriber owned and reseller owned pagers for which arch receives no recurring equipment revenue and ii an increase in the number of reseller customers whose airtime is purchased at wholesale rates 
the reduction in average paging revenue per subscriber resulting from these trends has been more than offset by the elimination of associated expenses so that arch s margins have improved over such period 
arch s total revenues have increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  and to million in the year ended december  over the same periods  through operating efficiencies and economies of scale  arch has been able to reduce its per pager operating costs to enhance its competitive position in its markets 
due to the rapid growth in its subscriber base  arch has incurred significant selling expenses  which are charged to operations in the period incurred 
arch has reported net losses of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively  as a result of significant depreciation and amortization expenses related to acquired and developed assets and interest charges associated with indebtedness 
however  as its subscriber base has grown  arch s operating results have improved  as evidenced by an increase in its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  and to million in the year ended december  ebitda is a standard measure of financial performance in the paging industry and also is one of the financial measures used to calculate whether arch and its subsidiaries are in compliance with the covenants under their respective debt agreements  but should not be construed as an alternative to operating income or cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
one of arch s financial objectives is to increase its ebitda  as such earnings are a significant source of funds for servicing indebtedness and for investment in continued growth  including purchase of pagers and paging system equipment  construction and expansion of paging systems and possible acquisitions 
forward looking statements this form k contains forward looking statements 
for this purpose  any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those indicated or suggested by such forward looking statements 
these factors include  without limitation  those set forth below under the caption factors affecting future operating results 
shift in operating focus in april  the company announced it was shifting its operating focus to put a higher priority on leverage reduction than subscriber unit growth 
arch s deleveraging efforts are focusing on  but are not limited to  slowing capital expenditures  implementing across the board efficiencies and the possible sale of non strategic assets 
results of operations the following table presents certain items from arch s consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net revenues total revenues less cost of products sold and certain other information for the periods indicated year ended december  total revenues cost of products sold net revenues operating expenses service  rental and maintenance selling general and administrative depreciation and amortization 
operating income loss net income loss ebitda annual service  rental and maintenance expenses per pager 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  total revenues increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  and net revenues increased million  or  from million to million over the same period 
service  rental and maintenance revenues  which consist primarily of recurring revenues associated with the sale or lease of pagers  increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  these increases in revenues were due primarily to the increase in the number of pagers in service from  at december  to  at december  and the full year impact of the westlink holdings  inc westlink acquisition which was completed in may all net new subscribers were generated through internal growth 
maintenance revenues represented less than of total service  rental and maintenance revenues in the years ended december  and arch does not differentiate between service and rental revenues 
product sales  less cost of products sold  increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  as a result of a greater number of pager unit sales 
service  rental and maintenance expenses  which consist primarily of telephone line and site rental expenses  increased to million of net revenues in the year ended december  from million of net revenues in the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to increased expenses associated with system expansions and the provision of paging services to a greater number of subscribers 
as existing paging systems become more populated through the addition of new subscribers  the fixed costs of operating these paging systems are spread over a greater subscriber base 
annual service  rental and maintenance expenses per subscriber decreased to in the year ended december  from in the year ended december  selling expenses increased to million of net revenues in the year ended december  from million of net revenues in the year ended december  the increase in selling expenses was primarily due to the full year impact of the westlink acquisition and the marketing costs incurred to promote the company s arch paging brand identity 
arch s selling cost per net new pager in service increased to in the year ended december  from in the year ended december   primarily due to fixed selling costs and increased marketing costs being spread over fewer net new pagers put into service 
most selling expenses are directly related to the number of net new subscribers added 
therefore  such expenses may increase in the future if pagers in service are added at a more rapid rate than in the past 
general and administrative expenses increased to million of net revenues in the year ended december  from million of net revenues in the year ended december  the increase in absolute dollars was due primarily to increased expenses associated with supporting more pagers in service including the full year impact of westlink 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million of net revenues in the year ended december  from million of net revenues in the year ended december  these expenses reflect arch s acquisitions of paging businesses  accounted for as purchases  and continued investment in pagers and other system expansion equipment to support continued growth 
operating loss increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  as a result of the factors outlined above 
net interest expense increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the increase was attributable to an increase in arch s average outstanding debt 
in and interest expense includes approximately million and million  respectively  of non cash interest accretion on the company s senior discount notes due under which semi annual interest payments commence on september  see note to arch s consolidated financial statements 
during the years ended december  and  the company recognized income tax benefits of million and million  respectively  representing the tax benefit of operating losses subsequent to the acquisitions of usa mobile communications holdings  inc usa mobile and westlink which were available to offset deferred tax liabilities arising from the company s acquisitions of usa mobile in september and westlink in may during  arch recognized an extraordinary charge of million  representing the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the prepayment of indebtedness under separate prior credit facilities

liquidity and capital resources arch s business strategy requires the availability of substantial funds to finance the expansion of existing operations  to fund capital expenditures for pagers and paging system equipment  to finance acquisitions and to service debt 
capital expenditures and commitments excluding acquisitions of paging businesses  arch s capital expenditures were million in the year ended december   million in the year ended december  and million in the year ended december  to date  arch has funded its capital expenditures with net cash provided by operating activities  the issuance of equity securities and the incurrence of debt 
arch has agreed  to the extent such funds are not available to benbow from other sources and subject to the approval of arch s designee on benbow s board of directors  to advance to benbow sufficient funds to service debt obligations incurred by benbow in connection with its acquisition of its narrowband pcs licenses and to finance the build out of a regional narrowband pcs system 
arch estimates that the total cost to benbow of servicing such debt obligations and constructing such regional narrowband pcs system will be approximately million over the next five years 
arch currently anticipates capital expenditures of approximately million to million for the year ending december   primarily for the purchase of pagers and paging system equipment 
such amounts are subject to change based on the company s internal growth rate and acquisition activity  if any  during arch believes that it will have sufficient cash available from operations and credit facilities to fund these expenditures 
acquisitions in may  arch completed its acquisition of westlink for aggregate consideration of million in cash including direct transaction costs 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september  arch completed its acquisition of usa mobile for an aggregate consideration of million  consisting of million in cash including direct transaction costs   shares of common stock valued at million on the date of completion and the assumption of liabilities of million  including million of long term debt 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
during  the company also completed five additional acquisitions for aggregate consideration of million in cash plus the issuance of  shares of common stock valued at million on the date of completion 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company has pursued and intends to continue to pursue acquisitions of paging businesses as part of its growth strategy 
as a result  the company evaluates acquisition opportunities on an ongoing basis and from time to time is engaged in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions 
sources of funds arch s net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
arch believes that its capital needs for the foreseeable future will be funded with borrowings under current and future credit facilities  net cash provided by operations and  depending on the company s needs and market conditions  possible sales of equity or debt securities 
for additional information  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
inflation inflation has not had a material effect on arch s operations to date 
paging systems equipment and operating costs have not increased in price and arch s pager costs have declined substantially in recent years 
this reduction in costs has generally been reflected in lower pager prices charged to subscribers who purchase their pagers 
arch s general operating expenses  such as salaries  employee benefits and occupancy costs  are subject to normal inflationary pressures 
factors affecting future operating results the following important factors  among others  could cause the company s actual operating results to differ materially from those indicated or suggested by forward looking statements made in this form k or presented elsewhere by the company s management from time to time 
indebtedness and high degree of leverage the company is highly leveraged 
at december   the company had outstanding million of total debt  including i million accreted value of the senior discount notes due  ii million principal amount of the senior notes due of usa mobile ii  iii million principal amount of the senior notes due of usa mobile ii  iv million borrowed under the arch enterprises credit facility  v million borrowed under the usa mobile ii credit facility  and vi million principal amount of the company s convertible subordinated debentures due the ability of the company to make payments of principal and interest on its indebtedness will be dependent upon the company s subsidiaries achieving and sustaining levels of performance in the future that will permit such subsidiaries to pay sufficient dividends  distributions or fees to the company 
many factors  some of which will be beyond the company s control  such as prevailing economic conditions  will affect the performance of the company and its subsidiaries 
in addition  covenants imposed by the current and future credit facilities and other indebtedness of the company and its subsidiaries could restrict the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness and prohibit certain activities and may limit other aspects of the company s operations 
there can be no assurance that the company or its subsidiaries will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to cover required interest and principal payments on their current and future indebtedness 
if the company is unable to meet interest and principal payments in the future  it may  depending upon the circumstances which then exist  seek additional equity or debt financing  attempt to refinance its existing indebtedness or sell all or part of its business or assets to raise funds to repay its indebtedness 
there can be no assurance that sufficient equity or debt financing will be available or  if available  that it will be on terms acceptable to the company  that the company will be able to refinance its existing indebtedness or that sufficient funds could be raised through asset sales 
the company s high degree of leverage may have important consequences for the company  including i the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to obtain additional financing for acquisitions  working capital  capital expenditures or other purposes  if necessary  may be impaired or such financing may not be on favorable terms  ii a substantial portion of the cash flow of the company s subsidiaries will be used to pay interest expense  which will reduce the funds which would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities  iii the company may be more highly leveraged than its competitors which may place it at a competitive disadvantage  and iv the company s high degree of leverage will make it more vulnerable to a downturn in its business or the economy generally 
future capital needs the company s business strategy requires the availability of substantial funds to service debt and finance the continued development and future growth and expansion of its operations  including possible acquisitions 
the amount of capital required by the company will depend upon a number of factors  including subscriber growth  technological developments  marketing and sales expenses  competitive conditions  acquisition strategy and acquisition opportunities 
no assurance can be given that additional equity or debt financing will be available to the company on acceptable terms  if at all 
the unavailability of sufficient financing when needed would have a material adverse effect on the company 
history of losses the company has not reported any net income since its inception 
the company reported net losses of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
these net losses have resulted principally from i substantial depreciation and amortization expenses  primarily related to intangible assets and pager depreciation and ii interest expense on debt incurred primarily to finance acquisitions of paging operations and other costs of growth 
substantial and increased amounts of debt are expected to be outstanding for the foreseeable future  which will result in significant additional interest expense which could have a substantial negative impact on the company 
the company expects to continue to report net losses for the foreseeable future 
growth and acquisition strategy the company has pursued and intends to continue to pursue acquisitions of paging businesses as well as the continued internal growth of the company s paging business 
the process of integrating acquired paging businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of the time and attention of the company s management and the financial and other resources of the company 
no assurance can be given that suitable additional acquisitions can be identified  financed and completed on acceptable terms  or that the company s future acquisitions will be successful 
implementation of the company s growth strategies will be subject to numerous other contingencies beyond the control of the company  including general and regional economic conditions  interest rates  competition  changes in regulation or technology and the ability to attract and retain skilled employees 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that the company s growth strategies will prove effective or that the goals of the company will be achieved 
dependence on key personnel the success of the company will be dependent  to a significant extent  upon the continued services of a relatively small group of executive personnel 
the company does not have employment agreements with any of its current executive officers  although all current executive officers have entered into non competition and executive retention agreements with the company 
the loss or unavailability of one or more of its executive officers or the inability to attract or retain key employees in the future could have an adverse effect upon the company s operations 
competition and technological change the company faces competition from other paging service providers in all markets in which it operates as well as from certain competitors who hold nationwide licenses 
the company believes that competition for paging subscribers is based on quality of service  geographic coverage and price and that the company generally competes effectively based on these factors 
monthly fees for basic paging services have  in general  declined since the company commenced operations in september  due in part to competitive conditions  and the company may face significant price based competition in the future which could adversely affect the company 
some of the company s competitors possess greater financial  technical and other resources than the company 
a trend towards increasing consolidation in the paging industry in particular and the wireless communications industry in general in recent years has led to competition from increasingly larger and better capitalized competitors 
if any of such competitors were to devote additional resources to the paging business or focus its strategy on the company s markets  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected 
a variety of wireless two way communication technologies currently are in use or under development 
although such technologies generally are higher priced than paging services or not widely available  technological improvements could result in increased capacity and efficiency for wireless two way communication and  accordingly  could result in increased competition for the company 
two way service providers also could elect to provide paging service as an adjunct to their primary services 
future technological advances in the telecommunications industry could increase new services or products competitive with the paging services provided by the company or could require the company to reduce the price of its paging services or incur additional capital expenditures to meet competitive requirements 
recent and proposed regulatory changes by the fcc are aimed at encouraging such technological advances and new services 
for example  the fcc has created potential sources of competition by opening up new spectrum for such services as the general wireless communications service gwcs and the wireless communications service wcs as well as speeding up licensing of other services through auctions  including the local multipoint distribution service lmds  mhz and broadband pcs services 
entities offering service on wireless two way communications technology  including cellular telephones and specialized mobile radio services  also compete with the paging services that the company provides 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully with its current and future competitors in the paging business or with competitors offering alternative communication technologies 
subscriber turnover the results of operations of wireless messaging service providers  such as the company  can be significantly affected by subscriber cancellations 
the sales and marketing costs associated with attracting new subscribers are substantial relative to the costs of providing service to existing customers 
because the paging business is characterized by high fixed costs  disconnection s directly and adversely affect operating cash flow 
an increase in its subscriber cancellation rate may adversely affect the company s results of operations 
dependence on suppliers the company does not manufacture any of the pagers used in its paging operations 
the company buys pagers primarily from motorola  inc motorola and nec america  inc nec and therefore is dependent on such manufacturers to obtain sufficient pager inventory for new subscriber and replacement needs 
in addition  the company purchases terminals and transmitters primarily from glenayre technologies  inc glenayre and motorola and thus is dependent on such manufacturers for sufficient terminals and transmitters to meet its expansion and replacement requirements 
to date  the company has not experienced significant delays in obtaining pagers  terminals or transmitters  but there can be no assurance that the company will not experience such delays in the future 
the company has never had a purchase agreement with glenayre or nec 
the company s purchase agreement with motorola expired in december  with a provision for automatic renewal for a one year term 
although the company believes that sufficient alternative sources of pagers  terminals and transmitters exist  there can be no assurance that the company would not be adversely affected if it were unable to obtain these items from current supply sources or on terms comparable to existing terms 
government regulation  foreign ownership and possible redemption of capital stock the paging operations of the company are subject to regulation by the fcc and various state regulatory agencies 
there can be no assurance that those agencies will not propose or adopt regulations or take actions that would have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
changes in regulation of the company s paging business or the allocation of radio spectrum for services that compete with the company s business could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
indeed  the fcc has created potential sources of competition by opening up new spectrum for such services as the gwcs and the wcs as well as  speeding up licensing of other services through auctions  including the lmds  mhz and broadband pcs services 
further  the fcc has recently adopted rules implementing a market area licensing scheme 
in addition  some aspects of the recently enacted telecommunications act of could have a beneficial effect on arch s business  but other provisions may place additional burdens upon arch or subject arch to increased competition 
the communications act of  as amended  limits foreign ownership of entities that hold certain licenses from the fcc 
because the company  through its subsidiaries  holds fcc licenses  in general  no more than of the company s stock can be owned or voted by aliens or their representatives  a foreign government or its representative or a foreign corporation  the company s restated certificate of incorporation permits the redemption of shares of the company s capital stock from foreign stockholders where necessary to protect the company s regulatory licenses  but such redemption would be subject to the availability of capital to the company and any restrictions contained in the debt instruments of the company and under delaware law 
the failure to redeem such shares promptly could jeopardize the company s fcc licenses 
impact of the year issue the company is currently working to resolve the potential impact of the year on the processing of date sensitive information by the company s computerized systems and transmission equipment 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
based on preliminary information  costs of addressing potential problems are not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows in future periods 
however  if the company  its customers or vendors are unable to resolve such processing issues in a timely manner  it could result in a material financial risk 
accordingly  the company plans to devote the necessary resources to resolve all significant year issues in a timely manner
