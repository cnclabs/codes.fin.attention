item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page the company conducts its worldwide chemicals operations through two global business units polymer chemicals and fine chemicals  which in conformity with the company s adoption of the financial accounting standards board s fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information will be reported as two separate and distinct segments in albemarle manufactures a broad range of chemicals  most of which are additives to or intermediates for plastics  polymers and elastomers  cleaning products  agricultural compounds  pharmaceuticals  photographic chemicals  drilling compounds and biocides 
most sales of the company s products are made directly to manufacturers of the aforementioned products  including chemical and polymer companies  pharmaceutical companies  cleaning product manufacturers  paper and photographic companies  drilling companies and water treatment companies 
the company produces the majority of its products in the united states  but also has a significant production facility in france and also has aluminum alkyls produced for it by amoco at the company s former feluy  belgium plant 
the processes and technology for most of these products were developed in the company s or its predecessor s research and development laboratories 
the polymer chemicals business produces a broad range of chemicals  including flame retardants  catalysts  polymer curatives and antioxidants 
in most flame retardant product lines  the company s plants operated below capacity during the expansion of brine field and bromine capacities at the company s magnolia  ark  facility that started in  continued 
the overall result of the current phase of the program will be a bromine production capacity increase of thirty percent 
during  the company announced plans to build a world class production facility for saytex rb flame retardant to be located at the company s magnolia  ark  facility and targeted to start up in late the company continues to focus on expansion of its bromine production capabilities 
the company began receiving orders during for saytex hp flame retardant product  a new brominated polystyrene product for use in engineered plastics 
in the third quarter  the company started a market development unit plant in its baton rouge research and development facility to make this product and began to fill orders 
a new commercial plant is under construction with a targeted startup in mid aluminum alkyls are used as cocatalysts in the production of polyolefins  such as polyethylene and polypropylene  elastomers  alpha olefins such as hexene  octene  and decene  and organotin heat stabilizers  and in the preparation of organic intermediates 
the company has continued to expand and debottleneck its production capacity at pasadena  texas and orangeburg  sc it has also strengthened its supply chain for methylaluminoxane mao  a cocatalyst used in metallocene catalyst systems  by increasing capacity for mao and for the key raw materials needed to make mao

also produced are antioxidants and alkylated hindered phenolics that are used to maintain the performance integrity of thermoplastic resins 
products of the fine chemicals business include elemental bromine  alkyl bromides  inorganic bromides  a number of bromine fine chemicals  and pharmachemical and agrichemical intermediates 
applications for these products primarily exist in chemical synthesis  oil and gas well drilling and completion fluids  water purification  glass making  cleaning products  soil fumigation and chemical intermediates for pharmaceutical  photographic and agricultural chemicals 
products originally a part of what was the olefins and alcohols businesses but not sold to amoco  are included as a part of fine chemicals 
these products include tertiary amines for surfactants and biocides  disinfectants and sanitizers  zeolite a sodium alumina silicate used as a phosphate replacement in laundry detergent builders  and alkenyl succinic anhydride asa used in paper sizing formulations 
these products have many varied customers 
they are sold to suppliers for use in household  institutional and industrial cleaners  personal care products and industrial products 
the company s primary bulk actives  ibuprofen and naproxen  are widely used pharmaceuticals that provide fever reduction and temporary relief of aches and pains and menstrual cramps 
bulk ibuprofen is formulated into tablets by pharmaceutical companies who sell to customers in both the prescription and over the counter markets 
ibuprofen products account for more than of the us over the counter analgesic market 
they compete against other painkillers containing aspirin  acetaminophen  ketoprofen and naproxen 
the company is one of the world s largest producers of bulk ibuprofen 
in  the company started commercial production of bulk naproxen with initial sales commencing in the us only after customers obtained us food and drug administration fda approval 
agricultural intermediates are sold to chemical companies that supply finished products to farmers  governments and others 
these products include orthoalkylated anilines for the acetanilide family of pre emergent herbicides used on corn  soybeans and other crops  and organophosphorus products for insecticide use 
a new agricultural intermediate an urease inhibitor  primarily for use on corn to improve the effectiveness of nitrogen based fertilizers  underwent commercial scale trials and expanded testing in the company s subsidiary albemarle ppc appc operates a plant in thann  france 
appc is one of the world s largest producers of organic and inorganic brominated compounds used mainly in pharmaceutical  photographic and agricultural chemical intermediates 
appc also operates an electrolysis unit to produce high purity caustic potash and potassium carbonate used in the glass  water treatment  cleaning product and food industries 
appc strengthens the company s position in fine chemicals and provides substantial additional manufacturing and research and development capabilities in europe 
in most fine chemicals product lines  the company s plants operated near capacity during  with the exception of bulk ibuprofen  halide aluminum alkyls and bulk naproxen which had excess capacity 
the company operates on a worldwide basis with i a manufacturing plant located in france in addition to facilities in the united states  ii offices and distribution terminals in belgium  france  japan and singapore as well as the united states and iii offices in hong kong and beijing  china 
the company has no significant assets in countries in which those assets would be deemed to be exposed to substantial risk 
see note geographic area information of notes to the consolidated financial statements in item on page competition the company operates in a highly competitive marketplace  competing against a number of other companies in each of its product lines 
some markets involve a significant number of competitors  while others involve only a few 
the competitors of the company are both larger and smaller in terms of resources and market share 
competition generally is based on product performance  reputation for quality  price and customer service and support 
the degree and nature of competition depends on the type of product involved 
in general  the company competes in all of its markets on the basis of the quality and price of its products as well as customer services  by maintaining a broad range of products and by focusing resources on products in which the company has a competitive advantage 
the company endeavors to improve its reputation for quality products  competitive prices and excellent customer service and support 
competition in connection with all of the company s products requires continuing investments in research and development  product and process improvements and specialized customer services 
through research and development  the company and its subsidiaries will seek to increase margins by introducing value added products and products based on proprietary technologies 
raw materials raw materials used by the company include ethylene  potassium chloride  aluminum  ortho toluidine  bisphenol a  chlorine  phenol  isobutylene  caustic soda  toluene  diphenyl oxide  alumina trihydrate  dimethlyamine  phthalic anhydride  alpha olefins  maleic anhydride  ethanol  phosphorus  sulfuric acid  and nitrogen  as well as electricity and natural gas as fuels  most of which are readily available from numerous suppliers and are purchased or provided under contracts at prices the company believes are competitive 
the company also produces bromine in arkansas from its extensive brine reserves backed by an active leasing program 
the company has signed supply agreements with the dead sea bromine group of companies 
the contracts essentially cover the bromine requirements for the production of bromine fine chemicals in our thann  france facility and provide additional bromine if requested for the company s other bromine needs 
major customers due to the diversity of product lines in which the company competes  no major portion of the company s sales or earnings was generated by one customer nor is the company overly reliant on contracts with any one public  private or governmental entity 
several of the company s customers manufacture products for cyclical industries such as the agricultural  automotive  electronics and building and construction industries 
as a result  demand for the products of the company from customers in such industries also is cyclical 
in addition  the profitability of sales of certain of the company s products depends on the level of industry plant capacity utilization 
due to the diversity and size of the company s operations  there is little seasonal variation in revenues or earnings  except for certain agricultural products 
other matters on march   the company sold its olefins business to amoco for million  including plant and equipment  other assets  inventory and accounts receivable net of expenses and related trade payables paid by the company

operating costs and expenses cost of goods sold in decreased million from primarily due to the absence of shipments of the olefins business for two months in  offset in part by increased shipments in  with the result that the gross profit margin increased to in from in the improvement in gross margin reflects improved plant utilizations and the impact of the company s cost reduction program 
average energy costs were higher during and reflected an unusually strong natural gas market 
albemarle s overall raw material prices were generally flat compared to with the exception of ethylene and ethylene derivatives which were higher 
cost of goods sold in decreased million from primarily due to the absence of shipments of the olefins business for ten months in and the electronic materials business for all of versus and higher foreign exchange gains in with the result that the gross profit margin increased to in from in the reductions in cost of goods sold were partially offset by higher costs in pharmaceutical intermediates  related primarily to naproxen sampling and start up costs  as well as higher operating costs resulting from underutilization of assets in flame retardants in average energy unit costs were higher in both natural gas and electricity prices were higher in than in the prior year 
raw material prices were generally lower in than in the prior year with ethylene  aluminum  potassium chloride and phthalic anhydride having the largest decreases 
selling  general and administrative expenses  combined with research and development expenses  decreased million in from  primarily due to lower outside consulting costs and lower employee related expenses resulting from the company s workforce reduction program implemented in conjunction with the sale of the olefins business and lower expenses associated with the exercise of stock appreciation rights and the award of restricted stock than in  offset in part by normal salary increases in this compares to a million decrease in from  primarily due to lower employee related expenses as a result of the march   sale of the olefins business and the july   sale of the electronic materials business  offset in part by normal salary increases and the expense associated with the exercise of certain stock appreciation rights and the award of restricted stock in as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses  including research and development expenses  decreased to in from in versus in operating profit operating profit in increased from excluding the first two months of operating profits of the olefins business sold  operating profits would have shown an increase of approximately over the period benefited primarily from increased shipments in agricultural chemicals  organometallics and antioxidants  increased shipments and improved costs in pharmaceuticals and bromine fine chemicals  and improved costs in european potassium and chlorine chemicals  while flame retardants were down primarily due to the effects of a stronger us dollar 
operating profit in decreased from excluding the results of businesses sold  operating profit was also down significantly primarily due to lower shipments and higher costs in pharmaceutical intermediates and flame retardants 
costs in pharmaceutical intermediates were higher primarily due to the expenses associated with commercializing naproxen for introduction in mid while the flame retardants business was heavily impacted by a lengthy slowdown in the electronics industry resulting in higher costs associated with the underutilization of assets 
interest and financing expenses and other income interest and financing expenses in decreased million from primarily due to higher capitalization of interest on capital projects in this compares to a decrease of million in from primarily due to lower average debt outstanding  reflecting pay down of debt with proceeds from the sale of the olefins business

outlook in  the company saw significant improvement in its profitability built upon its focus on cost reductions and plant efficiencies as well as a seven percent growth in revenues 
as the company goes into  it expects to continue to face the challenges of a strong us dollar and its impact on the company s revenue growth 
in fine chemicals  the company initiated sales in the us of the analgesic naproxen following late approval of some prospective customers by the us food and drug administration  but remain disappointed in the level and pace of its efforts 
the company s bulk ibuprofen sales continue strong  a trend that began to develop in the latter half of the company s emerging surface actives business continues to focus on the cleaning and water treating industries 
an expanded range of admox surfactants and u 
s 
environmental protection agency epa registered quaternary biocides will be targeted at formulators of hard surface cleaning products 
sanibrom biocides are expected to increase penetration of the industrial and recreational water treating areas by replacing chlorine based sanitizers with safer  more effective bromine based products 
abzol cleaners are receiving broader acceptance in the electronic and precision cleaning markets  but their full potential will not be realized until the epa s significant new alternatives policy approval is received 
the company is hopeful for a recovery in gulf coast oil drilling operations that use its bromine based completion fluids 
the polymer chemicals unit introduced two new flame retardants in late prospective customers are qualifying these products at this time 
the company expects sales of these products to pick up later in  assuming successful completion of this qualification process 
the company s new catalyst business continues to reach some of its milestones as the company seeks to become a full service catalyst supplier to the polymer industry 
the company continues to work toward a mid startup of the plant to produce ethacure curative used in cast polyurethane elastomers and other applications 
the curative offers several handling and processing benefits over other similar products 
the economic turmoil in asia is a concern to the company in light of our sales into the region 
however  the company s products are purchased for use in other products  primarily electronics  sold in the us and europe 
these economies continue to experience good economic growth  and demand for such products is strong 
the company continues to keep a close watch on conditions  including the creditworthiness of its customers 
as part of the company s efforts to insure that the change of dates beginning in the year will not cause disruption to its business information and process systems  the company established a project team in to determine the scope of this issue and to map the implementation of solutions 
the company completed the preliminary review and expects to implement new systems in to provide ample time for testing and final implementation in the company s completion of key software changes in  including enterprise wide sap  peoplesoft and lotus notes software platforms  should make the company s financial  operations  planning  human resources and general business areas year compliant 
preliminary estimates for two year expenditures are approximately million 
some of the information presented above constitutes forward looking comments within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of although the company believes its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its businesses and operations  there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from its expectations 
factors which could cause actual results to differ from expectations include  without limitation  the timing of orders received from customers  the gain or loss of significant customers  competition from other manufacturers  changes in the demand for the company s products  increases in the cost of the product  changes in the market in general  fluctuations in foreign currencies and significant changes in new product introduction resulting in an increase in capital project requests and approvals leading to additional capital spending 
financial condition and liquidity cash and cash equivalents at december  were million  which represents an increase of million from million at year end cash provided from operating activities was million  which together with million of proceeds from borrowings were used to cover operating activities in  including a working capital increase reflecting mainly higher accounts receivable and inventories and a decrease in accounts payable  capital expenditures  payment of quarterly dividends to common shareholders  purchase  shares of common stock for million and repayment of a portion of long term debt  with the balance added to cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents at december  were million  which represented a decrease of million from million at year end cash provided from operating activities was million which included installment income tax payments of million on the gain from the sale of the olefins business 
excluding the impact of the installment income tax payments  which were paid from the proceeds on the sale of the olefins business  cash flows from operations would have been million  which together with million of proceeds from borrowings  were used to cover operating activities in  including a working capital increase reflecting mainly higher accounts receivable and inventories  capital expenditures  payment of quarterly dividends to common shareholders  and the purchase of  shares of common stock for million 
proceeds from the sale of the olefins business of million  net of expenses and trade payables paid by the company  supplemented by million from cash on hand  were used to purchase  shares of common stock  repay long term debt and pay income tax installments related to the sale 
the company anticipates that cash provided from operating activities in the future will be sufficient to cover its operating expenses  debt service obligations  dividend payments to common shareholders  and to fund a portion of its capital expenditures 
the noncurrent portion of the company s long term debt amounted to million at december   compared to million at the end of the company s total long term debt  including the current portion as a percentage of total capitalization at december   was approximately see note long term debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements on pages and for details of the company s long term borrowings 
the company  at december   had the flexibility to borrow up to a total of million million outstanding at december  under its competitive advance and revolving credit facility agreement credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains certain covenants typical for a credit agreement of its size and nature  including financial covenants requiring the company to maintain consolidated indebtedness as defined of not more than of the sum of the company s consolidated shareholders equity as defined and consolidated indebtedness 
the amount and timing of any borrowings will depend on the company s specific cash requirements 
the company s foreign currency translation adjustments  net of related deferred taxes  at december   decreased from december   primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar 
capital expenditures in of million were lower than the level of million 
the company s capital spending program is expected to increase significantly over the next few years 
this increase is expected to expand capacities at existing facilities to support an expected increase in sales 
capital spending for environmental and safety projects is expected to be about the same over the next few years 
future capital spending is expected to be financed primarily with cash provided from operating activities  with the balance  if necessary  provided by additional long term debt 
the company continues to evaluate potential acquisitions of facilities and or businesses  particularly in areas where our know how adds value 
environmental matters the company is subject to federal  state  local and foreign requirements regulating the handling  manufacture or use of materials some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies  the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment 
to the best of the company s knowledge  it is currently complying with and expects to continue to comply in all material respects with existing environmental laws  regulations  statutes and ordinances 
such compliance with federal  state  local and foreign environmental protection laws is not expected to have in the future  a material effect on earnings or the competitive position of albemarle 
among other environmental requirements  the company is subject to the federal superfund law  and similar state laws  under which the company may be designated as a potentially responsible party prp and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites 
management believes that in most cases  the company s participation is de minimis 
further  almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated  studied and in many cases settled by the company or its predecessor company 
in de minimis prp matters  the company s policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement  enabling the company to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a prp  except for remote contingencies 
in other than de minimis prp matters  the company s records indicate that unresolved exposures should be immaterial 
the company accrues and expenses its proportionate share of prp costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for contingencies and financial accounting standards board s fasb interpretation no 
 as clarified by american institute of certified public accountant s statement of position because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental matters  the company is able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved prp sites should not be material to operations 
the company s environmental and safety operating costs charged to expense  which are not considered to be normal operating costs were approximately million in versus approximately million in and million in  excluding depreciation of previous capital expenditures  and are expected to be in the same range in the next few years 
costs for remediation have been accrued and payments related to sites are charged against accrued liabilities  which at december   totaled approximately million 
there is a reasonable possibility that future remediation costs in excess of amounts already recorded could be up to million before income taxes 
however  the company believes that any sum it may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation matters in excess of the amounts recorded would occur over a period of time and should not have a material adverse impact on its financial condition or results of operations  but could have a material adverse impact in a particular reporting period
