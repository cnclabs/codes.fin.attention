item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
competition the registrant competes internationally with several thousand forest products firms  ranging from very large  fully integrated firms to smaller firms that may manufacture only one or a few items 
the registrant estimates that approximately forest products firms comprise its major competition 
the registrant also competes less directly with firms that manufacture substitutes for wood building products 
a majority of the products manufactured by the registrant  including lumber  structural panels  and pulp  are commodity products sold primarily on the basis of price in competition with numerous other forest products companies 
the registrant has introduced a number of value enhanced products to complement its traditional lumber and panel products  such as the osb smartstart tm system of siding and exterior products and flooring  and a radiant barrier product known as techshield tm 
the registrant s cocoon tm cellulosic insulation products utilize wood fiber from waste paper and are believed to have better insulating and sound deadening properties than fiberglass insulation 
environmental compliance the registrant is subject to federal  state and local pollution control laws and regulations in all areas in which it has operating facilities 
the registrant maintains an accounting reserve for environmental loss contingencies 
from time to time  the registrant undertakes construction projects for environmental control facilities or incurs other environmental costs that extend an asset s useful life  improve efficiency  or improve the marketability of certain properties 
the registrant s policy is to comply fully with all applicable environmental laws and regulations 
in recent years  the registrant has devoted increasing financial and management resources to achieving this goal 
as part of its efforts to ensure environmental compliance  the registrant conducts regular internal environmental assessments 
from time to time  the registrant becomes aware of violations of applicable laws or regulations 
in those instances  the registrant s policy is to bring its operations promptly into full compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
the registrant is not aware of any instances in which its current operations are not in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations that would be expected to have a material adverse effect on the registrant

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general l p incurred a net loss in of million

l p s net losses in and primarily resulted from charges taken in the third quarter of each year 
the charge in was million pre tax million after tax  or per share and the charge was million pre tax million after tax  or per share 
these charges are discussed in further detail in note seven to the financial statements 
prior to the settlements  charges and other unusual items  l p had an after tax loss of million

l p operates in two major business segments building products and pulp 
building products is the most significant segment  accounting for more than percent of net sales in each of the past three years 
the results of operations are discussed below for each of these segments separately 
additional information about the factors affecting l p s segments is presented in the selected financial data in item and the product information summary in item in  the building products segment had a decline in sales and profitability  largely the result of an industry wide oversupply of structural panel products in north america 
in  the pulp segment lost money  but improved from the large losses suffered in however  the economic crisis in asia negatively impacted pulp segment results late in the year 
both the building products and pulp segments declined in sales and profitability in compared to the weakness in building products was primarily due to the structural panel oversupply  while pulp markets remained very weak throughout due to high world wide inventories 
the ketchikan pulp company contract issue discussed further below also negatively impacted pulp segment results in building products increase year ended dec 
 decrease dollar amounts in millions sales structural panel products   lumber industrial panel products other building products total building products    profit sales of structural panel products plywood and oriented strand board osb suffered in both and from industry wide over capacity 
the over capacity is the result of new osb plants built by the industry throughout north america at a rate greater than the growth in demand 
average selling prices in fell approximately compared to  while average prices were approximately lower than during the latter part of  l p s net sales realization was also negatively impacted by increased shipping costs caused by interrupted rail service 
structural panel sales volumes in decreased from levels as a result of the permanent closure of two plywood plants and four osb plants in and late sales volumes in increased approximately compared to due to new osb plants started up in that year  despite temporary market related shut downs at some of l p s osb plants 
lumber sales increased in due to a increase in average sales prices and a slight increase in volume sold 
lumber markets experienced strong demand through the first three quarters of  benefiting from a robust us economy  relatively low interest rates and strong housing starts 
late in the year  weakening currencies in asia limited shipments from north america to those markets which put supply pressure on domestic markets  causing lumber prices to decline 
this trend will likely continue into lumber sales were lower in than as a result of sales volume  which decreased approximately 
l p permanently closed a number of unprofitable sawmills around the country in and average selling prices rose about in due to a strong us economy  lower production volumes industry wide and lower volumes of lumber imported from canada 
industrial panels consist of particleboard  medium density fiberboard mdf and hardboard 
these sales decreased in compared to primarily because of lower sales prices of approximately 
the price decline was due primarily to increased industry production relative to demand 
industrial panel sales volumes in decreased slightly after a slight increase in compared to prices fell approximately in this price decline was also due to excess industry production 
the increase in other building products sales in was primarily due to the acquisition of associated chemists  inc coatings and chemicals in mid  greenstone industries  inc cellulose insulation in early and the assets of tecton laminates engineered i joists and lvl in early other building products sales decreased in due to lower wood chip sales 
l p was producing fewer wood chips due to lower sawmill and plywood production  and wood chip prices weakened significantly  particularly on the west coast 
the primary factor in the decrease in building products profits in was further erosion of osb sales prices 
also  higher log costs in the southern region of the country caused plywood earnings to be significantly reduced 
industrial panel profits also declined in as a result of lower sales prices 
lumber profits increased in due to higher average sales prices  which helped offset the profitability declines in structural and industrial panels 
building products profits decreased in from due to the lower prices discussed above for structural panel products and industrial panel products 
raw material costs were generally lower in than in  but did not fully offset the lower sales prices 
l p s building products are primarily sold as commodities and therefore sales prices fluctuate based on market factors over which l p has no control 
l p cannot predict whether the prices of its building products will remain at current levels  or will increase or decrease in the future because supply and demand are influenced by many factors  only two of which are the cost and availability of raw materials 
l p is not able to determine to what extent  if any  it will be able to pass any future increases in the price of raw materials on to customers through product price increases 
pulp increase year ended dec 
 decrease dollar amounts in millions pulp sales profit loss the single largest factor in the decline in pulp sales in was the closure in march of the pulp mill owned by l p s ketchikan pulp company kpc subsidiary 
pulp sales volumes decreased approximately  while average prices dropped approximately 
however  kpc pulp had a higher sales average than l p s two remaining pulp mills 
excluding kpc  l p s remaining pulp business showed an increase of in sales volume and a price decrease of approximately 
the asian economic crisis caused pulp prices to decline late in  which will likely continue into pulp sales plummeted in as sales prices fell an average of while volumes decreased about 
large pulp inventories around the world created very weak pulp markets throughout l p took intermittent downtime at the pulp mills during the year  which caused the volume decrease 
pulp segment profits improved significantly in due in large part to the shut down of the kpc mill which had been suffering losses due to market conditions and changes in the timber supply contract 
at the two remaining mills  l p successfully cut its operating costs through a concentrated cost reduction effort  both from more efficient operations and a central purchasing program 
after making a profit in  the pulp mills returned to losses in due to the downturn in the markets and problems experienced with the kpc contract 
raw material costs decreased in after experiencing an increase in l p s pulp products are primarily sold as commodities and therefore sales prices fluctuate based on market factors over which l p has no control 
l p cannot predict whether the prices of its pulp products will remain at current levels  or will increase or decrease in the future because supply and demand are influenced by many factors  only two of which are the cost and availability of raw materials 
l p is not able to determine to what extent  if any  it will be able to pass any future increases in the price of raw materials on to customers through product price increases 
the economic crisis in asia has continued into  which has negatively impacted pulp markets 
a significant portion of l p s pulp is sold to countries in that region 
l p pulp products are sold primarily to export customers and represent the majority of l p s export sales 
therefore  the decline in pulp sales was the primary reason for l p s decreased export sales in and  both in amount and as a percent of total sales 
information regarding l p s geographic segments and export sales are provided in the notes to financial statements under the caption segment information 
general corporate expense  net net general corporate expense was million in  compared to million in  and an unusually high amount of million in in and  the recurring level of general corporate expense has increased largely due to corporate wide training programs undertaken by current management and the addition of key personnel to drive future growth and improvement initiatives 
in  million of credits  resulting from a gain on the sale of assets  were netted into this expense 
the most significant factor in the amount was higher expenses associated with litigation against the company of approximately million  including legal fees and increases in contingency reserves it did not  however  include amounts recorded in the line item settlements  charges and other unusual items  net which is discussed in note seven to the financial statements 
settlements  charges and other unusual items  net for a discussion of settlements  charges and other unusual items  net  refer to note seven to the financial statements 
interest  net net interest expense rose significantly in and as l p borrowed funds to cover its settlement obligations and fund capital expenditures 
additionally  interest capitalized has decreased in and as construction projects have been completed 
also  interest income was lower in each of the past two years due to lower levels of cash available for investing 
legal and environmental matters for a discussion of legal and environmental matters involving l p and the potential effect on the company  refer to note eight to the financial statements 
financial position  liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operations increased to million in from million in  down from million in these fluctuations primarily correlate to changes in the company s net loss 
in  l p received a settlement from the us government of million for claims related to the kpc long term timber supply contract 
in and  l p paid out million and million for obligations related to litigation settlements 
net cash used in investing activities decreased to million from million in and million in capital expenditures peaked in with the addition of several new osb plants and other projects 
in and  l p received million and million of cash for assets sold 
l p has also spent significant amounts on environmental projects such as pollution control equipment  upgrades of existing production facilities  and timber to supply its operations and logging roads 
l p increased its net borrowings by million in and million in the borrowings financed the payments of settlement obligations and capital expenditures 
l p purchased only million of treasury shares in and no treasury shares in after purchasing million of treasury stock in l p has a revolving credit facility of million  which was fully borrowed at year end 
subsequent to year end  l p entered into an additional credit facility with a group of banks for an additional million  which is available to fund cash needs 
this additional credit facility must be repaid upon the sale of assets described below 
in october  l p announced that it intends to sell assets that management considers non strategic to l p s core businesses 
these assets include  among others  the remaining california redwood timberlands  related lumber and certain distribution businesses  the samoa  california  pulp mill  the weather seal window and door manufacturing business  the creative point  inc  subsidiary  the red bluff  california  cement fiber roof shake plant and the fiber gypsum plant in nova scotia 
as of year end  l p was actively marketing all of these assets and had sold the fiber gypsum plant 
l p presently estimates the proceeds from these sales at million to billion 
however  there can be no assurance that net proceeds within the foregoing range will be realized 
the proceeds realized will initially be used to fund operations and reduce or eliminate outstanding borrowings on l p s revolving credit facility 
management is currently studying alternative uses of the proceeds to maximize the long term value to l p and its stockholders 
l p has budgeted capital expenditures  including timber and logging road additions  for of approximately million 
these expenditures are primarily to complete an osb plant currently under construction  continue environmental improvements to existing plants  upgrade production facilities and provide timber to operations 
contingency reserves  which represent an estimate of future cash needs for various contingencies principally  payments for siding litigation settlements  total million  of which million is estimated to be payable within one year 
as with all accounting estimates  there is inherent uncertainty concerning the reliability and precision of such estimates 
as described in the notes to the financial statements under the heading contingencies  the amounts ultimately paid in settling all of the outstanding litigation could exceed the current reserves by a material amount 
l p continues to be in a strong financial condition with a relatively low ratio of long term debt as a percent of total capitalization 
management believes that existing cash and cash equivalents combined with additional borrowing available on lines of credit  expected income tax refunds  the significant cash inflow expected from the asset sale program described above and cash to be generated from operations will be sufficient to meet projected cash needs including the payments related to the siding litigation settlement referred to above 
the company also believes that because of its conservative financial structure and policies  it has substantial financial flexibility to generate additional funds should the need arise 
year compliance as the year approaches  an issue impacting most companies has emerged regarding the ability of computer applications and systems to properly interpret the year 
this is a pervasive and complex issue 
l p is in the process of identifying significant applications that will require modification to ensure year compliance 
internal and external resources are being used to make this assessment  the required modifications and test year compliance 
l p plans on completing the assessment of all significant applications and developing a plan for appropriate action by september  in addition  l p will begin communicating with others with whom it does significant business to determine their year compliance readiness and the extent to which l p is vulnerable to any third party year issues 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which l p s systems rely will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with l p s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on l p 
the total cost to l p of these year compliance activities has not been and is not anticipated to be material to its financial position or results of operations in any given year 
these costs and the date on which l p plans to complete the year assessment process are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ from those plans
