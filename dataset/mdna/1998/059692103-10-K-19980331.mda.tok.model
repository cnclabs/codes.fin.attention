the following discussion provides certain information concerning the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the company 
for a complete understanding of the following discussion  reference is made to the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented elsewhere in this annual report 
three years ended december  results of operations summary the table below summarizes the company s net income and returns on average assets and average shareholders equity for the years ended december   and in thousands  except per share amounts net income    net income per share basic diluted return on average assets return on average shareholders equity net interest revenue net interest revenue  principally interest earned on assets less interest costs on liabilities  provides the company with its principal source of income 
since net interest revenue is affected by changes in the levels of interest rates and the amount and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  one of management s primary tasks is to balance these interest sensitive components of assets and liabilities for the purpose of maximizing net interest revenue while at the same time minimizing interest rate risk to the company 
the following table presents the average components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for each year and their change  expressed as a percentage  from each of the prior years average average average balance change balance change balance change dollars in thousands interest earning assets deposits with other banks    held to maturity securities    available for sale securities    federal funds sold    loans and leases  net of unearned    mortgages held for sale    total interest earning assets    interest bearing liabilities deposits    federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements    long term debt    other    total interest bearing liabilities    non interest bearing deposits    in the growth of loans and leases slowed as compared to prior years 
loans and leases grew at faster rates than interest bearing deposits in and  however  the company s other funding sources  non interest bearing deposits  federal funds purchased and federal home loan bank advances  were adequate to fund its asset growth during such periods 
the changes in the components of interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities  and non interest bearing deposits resulted in the following tax equivalent net interest revenue expressed as a percentage of average earning assets for the years ended december   and net interest margin the company experienced a decrease in net interest margin in and as interest rates stabilized and volume growth in loans and leases slowed in as short term interest rates began to rise in  the net interest margin stabilized and then increased 
the company utilizes short term  intermediate term and long term borrowings from the federal home loan bank for the purpose of funding asset growth 
the company has sought to lengthen the maturity of deposits by actively seeking four and five year certificates of deposit with interest rates slightly above the relative market for such funds  thereby reducing the net interest margin in all three years presented 
interest rate sensitivity the interest sensitivity gap is the difference between the maturity or repricing scheduling of interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities for a given period of time 
a prime objective of asset liability management is to maximize net interest margin while maintaining a reasonable mix of interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
the following table sets forth the company s interest rate sensitivity at december  interest rate sensitivity december  maturing or repricing days over to to year to over days year years years in thousands interest earning assets interest bearing deposits due from banks  held to maturity securities     available for sale securities     loans leases  net of unearned     mortgages held for sale  total interest earning assets     interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand deposits savings    time deposits     federal funds purchased securities sold under repurchase agreements  long term debt    other total interest bearing liabilities     interest sensitivity gap     cumulative interest sensitivity gap     in the event interest rates decline after  it is likely that the company will experience a slightly positive effect on net interest income in the following one year period  as the cost of funds will decrease at a more rapid rate than interest income on interest bearing assets 
conversely  in periods of increasing interest rates  based on the current interest sensitivity gap  the company will experience decreased net interest income 
provisions for credit losses the company has an asset quality review staff which  with a committee of senior officers  reviews the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses in each accounting period 
an amount is provided as a charge against current income  based on this group s recommendation and senior management s approval  to maintain the allowance for credit losses at a level sufficient to absorb possible losses inherent in the existing loan and lease portfolios 
this provision is determined after examining potential losses in specific credits and considering the general risks associated with lending functions such as current and anticipated economic conditions  historical experience as related to losses  changes in the mix of the loan portfolio and credits which bear substantial risk of loss but which cannot be readily quantified 
the process of determining the adequacy of the provision requires that management make material estimates and assumptions  which are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term 
the provision for credit losses  the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans and leases outstanding at the end of each year and net charge offs are shown in the following table dollars in thousands provision for credit losses    allowance for credit losses as a percent of loans and leases outstanding at year end net charge offs    net charge offs as a percent of average loans the provision for credit losses for increased as compared to the provision for  principally as a result of the slower rate of growth in the loan portfolio and an increase in losses in consumer based loans 
the provision for credit losses increased from s level by as a result of the growth in loans and an increase in loan losses  primarily in consumer based loans 
the provision for credit losses increased from s level as a result of the growth in the loan portfolio 
other revenue the components of other revenue for the years ended december   and and the percentage change from the prior year are shown in the following table amount change amount change amount change dollars in thousands mortgage lending    service charges    life insurance premiums    trust income    securities gains losses  net  other revenue    total other revenue    mortgage lending revenue decreased in principally as a result of a decline in revenue related to mortgage servicing 
revenue from mortgage servicing was  in compared to  in the decrease is attributable to increased amortization of capitalized mortgage servicing rights along with changes in the valuation allowance for impairment 
capitalized mortgage servicing rights are evaluated for impairment based on the excess of the carrying amount of the mortgage servicing rights over their fair value 
revenue from mortgage origination and secondary marketing was  in compared to  in the revenue produced by mortgage lending activities increased in primarily as a result of declining interest rates and growth in servicing income 
in  mortgage lending revenue rebounded from the prior year s level as a result of stable interest rates and growth in servicing income 
amount change amount change amount change dollars in millions mortgage loans serviced at year end   service charges on deposit accounts increased in  and because of higher volumes of items processed as a result of increased economic activity and growth in the number of demand deposit accounts 
trust income increased in  in and in the trust business experienced steady growth as evidenced by increases in the number of trust accounts and the value of assets under care either managed or in custody 
other revenue increased  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in other revenue in was attributable to increases in gains on the sale of equipment and facilities and fees relating to greater usage of the bank s debit card 
the increases in and were principally as a result of increases in fees for non deposit related services 
other expense the components of other expense for the years ended december   and and the percentage change from the prior year are shown in the following table amount change amount change amount change dollars in thousands salary and employee benefits    occupancy net of rental income    equipment    deposit insurance   other    total other expense    increases in salary and employee benefits are primarily attributable to incentives and salary increases  additional employees to staff the banking locations added in each of the three years and the increased cost of employee health care benefits 
the company s stock option plans contain a provision for stock appreciation rights sars which requires the recognition of expense for stock price appreciation 
in the company s common stock price increased approximately which resulted in sars expense of million  as compared to million and million in and  respectively 
in the event that the market price of the company s common stock continues to increase  additional expense related to sars could be incurred  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
occupancy and equipment expenses have increased principally as a result of additional branch offices and upgrades to the company s internal operating systems 
deposit insurance premiums decreased substantially in  and as a result of lower insurance rates assessed by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
deposit insurance premiums are based upon the risk assessment classification assigned to a bank by the fdic 
in  a one time assessment on saif insured deposits was imposed which resulted in a pre tax payment of million and reduced after tax net income per share 
other expense increased in as a result of the out sourcing of certain computer programming expense  other equipment and software expense and system enhancements 
other expense increased in as a result of expanded telecommunications  systems enhancements  and credit card interchange fees  all of which related to providing higher levels of convenient consumer oriented banking services 
additionally  approximately  of unamortized expense relating to the issuance of the company s subordinated capital debentures was charged against earnings as a result of the early extinguishment of the debt issue in december other expense increased in principally as a result of merger expenses related to the company s acquisitions 
the expansion of the company s branch banking network also contributed to increases in all years presented 
financial condition loans the company s loan portfolio represents the largest single component of its earning asset base 
the following table indicates the average loans  year end balances of the loan portfolio and the percentage increases for the years presented amount change amount change amount change dollars in millions loans  net of unearned average    loans  net of unearned year end    the company s loan portfolio continues to grow 
the company strives to maintain a high quality loan portfolio  forsaking growth for quality 
the company s non performing assets which are carried either in the loan account or other assets on the consolidated balance sheets  were as follows at the end of each year presented in thousands foreclosed properties    non accrual loans    loans days or more past due    restructured loans total non performing assets    total non performing assets as a percent of net loans the company has not  as a matter of policy  participated in any highly leveraged transactions nor made any loans or investments relating to corporate transactions such as leveraged buyouts or leveraged recapitalizations 
at december   and  the company did not have any concentration of loans in excess of of loans outstanding 
loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to multiple borrowers engaged in similar activities  which would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions 
however  the company does conduct business in a geographically concentrated area 
the ability of the company s borrowers to repay loans is to some extent dependent upon the economic conditions prevailing in the market area 
included in non performing assets above were loans the company considered impaired totaling   and  in  and  respectively 
securities and other earning assets the securities portfolio is used to make various term investments  provide a source of liquidity and to serve as collateral to secure certain types of deposits 
a portion of the company s securities portfolio continues to be tax exempt 
investments in tax exempt securities totaled million at december   compared to million at the end of the company invests only in investment grade securities  with the exception of obligations of mississippi and tennessee counties and municipalities  and avoids other high yield non rated securities and investments 
at december   the company s available for sale securities totaled million 
these securities  which are subject to possible sale  are recorded at fair value 
at december   the company held no securities whose decline in fair value was considered other than temporary 
net unrealized gains on investment securities as of december  totaled million 
net unrealized gains on held to maturity securities comprised million of that total  while net unrealized gains on available for sale securities were million 
net unrealized gains on investment securities as of december   amounted to million 
of that total  million was attributable to held to maturity securities and to million available for sale securities 
these unrealized gains were a direct result of relatively stable intermediate term interest rates during and because the average maturity of securities owned is relatively short  market value fluctuations due to interest rate changes are softened and the impact of foregone earnings is reduced 
deposits the following table presents the company s average deposit mix and percentage change for the years indicated average average average balance change balance change balance change dollars in millions interest bearing deposits    non interest bearing deposits the company s deposit mix continued to experience change in by year end  other time deposits showed an increase of from the end of  while interest bearing demand deposits increased by and other short term savings accounts increased 
non interest bearing demand deposits increased from year end to year end management is of the opinion that the low interest rates paid on deposit accounts in and caused depositors to reduce the period over which they were willing to commit their funds and shifted their deposits from longer term  fixed rate instruments to daily savings and demand accounts  or even to seek alternative non bank investments 
while that trend continued into  the company has countered with a strategy of paying slightly above market rates for intermediate term deposits 
deposits are the company s primary source of funds to support its earning assets 
the company s primary market areas provide the sources of substantially all deposits for all periods presented 
liquidity the company s goal is to provide adequate funds to meet changes in loan demand or any potential increase in the normal level of deposit withdrawals 
this goal is accomplished primarily by maintaining sufficient short term liquid assets coupled with consistent growth in core deposits in order to fund earning assets and to maintain the availability of unused capacity to acquire funds in national and local capital markets 
the company s traditional sources of maturing loans  investment securities  mortgages held for sale  purchased federal funds and base of core deposits seem adequate to meet liquidity needs for normal operations 
the company maintains a relationship with the federal home loan bank  which provides an additional source of liquidity to fund term loans with borrowings of matched maturities 
the matching of these assets and liabilities has had the effect of reducing the company s net interest margin 
on october  the company announced that it would call for redemption all of its outstanding subordinated capital debentures due in on december  the company extinguished the debt by irrevocably depositing with the trustee  in cash plus accrued and unpaid interest from november  to redeem the debentures  which were redeemed on january capital resources the company is required to comply with the risk based capital guidelines established by the board of governors of the federal reserve system frb 
these guidelines apply a variety of weighting factors  which vary according to the level of risk associated with the assets 
capital is measured in two tiers tier i consists of paid up share capital  including common stock and disclosed reserves retained earnings and related surplus in the case of common stock  and tier ii consists of general allowance for losses on loans and leases  hybrid debt capital instruments  and all or a portion of other subordinated capital debt  depending upon remaining term to maturity 
the company s tier i capital and total capital  as a percentage of total risk adjusted assets  was and  respectively at december   compared to and  respectively at december  both ratios exceed the required minimum levels for these ratios of and  respectively 
in addition  the company s leverage capital ratio tier i capital divided by total assets  less goodwill was at december  and at december   compared to the required minimum leverage capital ratio of the fdic s capital based supervisory system for insured financial institutions categorizes the capital position for banks into five categories  ranging from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized 
for a bank to classify as well capitalized  the tier i risk based capital  total risk based capital and leverage capital ratios must be at least  and  respectively 
the company s bank subsidiary met the criteria for the well capitalized category at december  the company has determined to pursue acquisition transactions of depository institutions and businesses closely related to banking which further the company s business strategies 
the company anticipates that the consideration for substantially all of these transactions  if completed  will be shares of the company s common stock  however  transactions involving cash consideration or other forms of consideration will not be excluded 
on august  the company announced that it would purchase up to million of its outstanding common stock within the next year 
as of december  the company had purchased  shares at a cost of million 
an additional  shares were purchased in the first quarter of at a cost of million completing the announced purchase 
year the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the millennium year approaches 
the year problem is pervasive and complex as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to the issue is whether computer systems will properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
the company is utilizing both internal and external resources to identify  correct or reprogram  and test the systems for the year compliance 
during  the company developed a plan to deal with the year problem and established a year committee that consists of representatives from the major functional areas of the company 
the committee has conducted a comprehensive review of the company s computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the year issue and has developed an implementation plan to resolve potential problems 
we have reviewed our core mainframe systems and application subsystems and have obtained the year compliant releases and are developing the installation and testing plan for each of these applications 
we have corresponded with our third party service providers and other providers of software and hardware for certification of their compliance with year issues 
it is anticipated that all reprogramming efforts will be completed by december   allowing adequate time for testing 
management has assessed the year compliance expense and believe that the related potential effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations should be immaterial 
the company is expensing all costs associated with the year as the costs are incurred

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk reflects the risk of economic loss resulting from changes in interest rates and market prices 
this risk of loss can be reflected in either reduced potential net interest revenue in future periods or diminished market values of financial assets 
the company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk that is inherent in its lending  investment and deposit taking activities 
financial institutions derive their income primarily from the excess of interest collected over interest paid 
the rates of interest the company earns on its assets and owes on its liabilities are established contractually for a period of time 
since market interest rates change over time  the company is exposed to lower profit margins or losses if it cannot adapt to interest rate changes 
several techniques might be used by a financial institution to minimize interest rate risk 
one approach used by the company is to periodically analyze its assets and liabilities and make future financing and investing decisions based on payment streams  interest rates  contractual maturites  repricing opportunities and estimated sensitivity to actual or potential changes in market interest rates 
such activities fall under the broad definition of asset liability management 
the company s primary asset liability management technique is the measurement of its asset liability gap  that is  the difference between the amounts of interest sensitive assets and liabilities that will be refinanced repriced during a given period 
if the asset amount to be repriced exceeds the corresponding liability amount for a certain day  month  year or longer period  the company is in an asset sensitive gap position 
in this situation  net interest revenue would increase if market interest rates rose or decrease if market interest rates fell 
if  alternatively  more liabilities than assets will reprice  the company is in a liability sensitive position 
accordingly  net interest revenue would decline when rates rose and increase when rates fell 
these examples assume that interest rate changes for assets and liabilities are of the same magnitude  whereas actual interest rate changes generally differ in magnitude for assets and liabilities 
management seeks to manage interest rate risk through the utilization of various tools that include matching repricing periods for new assets and liabilities and managing the composition and size of the investment portfolio so as to reduce the risk in the deposit and loan portfolios while at the same time maximizing the yield generated from the portfolio 
the following table provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  the expected maturity categories take into account repricing opportunities as well as contractual maturities 
for core deposits without contractual maturities interest bearing checking  savings and money market accounts  the table presents cash flows based on management s judgement concerning their most likely runoff or repricing behaviors 
the fair values of loans  deposits and other borrowings are based on the discounted value of expected cash flows using a discount rate which is commensurate with the maturity
