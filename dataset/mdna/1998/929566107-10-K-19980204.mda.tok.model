overview this document contains forward looking statements 
these statements should be viewed in connection with the risk factors disclosed in the company s form k as filed with the securities and exchange commission on january  during  the company achieved net sales of million  which were higher than net sales of million 
net income for rose to million or per share as compared to million or per share in the increase in net sales is primarily attributable to the acquisition of certain assets of fruehauf trailer corporation fruehauf in april   the completion of the company s composite material facility in lafayette  indiana  and an estimated increase in us truck trailer demand 
on april   the company acquired substantially all of the remaining assets of fruehauf  a manufacturer and marketer of truck trailers and related parts 
the purchase included assets consisting of the fruehauf and propar r names  certain patents and trademarks  retail outlets in major metropolitan markets  an aftermarket parts distribution business  a specialty trailer manufacturing plant and a van manufacturing plant 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and accordingly  fruehauf s results are included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition 
this acquisition was strategic for wabash as it combined the largest fleet producer in the truck trailer industry with the largest retail distribution network  thereby providing important synergies in the areas of aftermarket parts and service as well as an expansive used trailer distribution network 
in the third quarter of  the company completed the construction of its new composite material facility in lafayette  indiana and began producing composite plate material for the company s proprietary duraplate r trailer introduced in late previously  the company was severely limited on the supply of the composite material from one supplier who was not able to increase its capacity 
the company s newly constructed composite material facility will allow the company to meet its long term material requirements internally and to continue to enhance the design and manufacturability of the duraplate trailer 
in  the us truck trailer industry experienced one of the best years in the industry s history with over  units shipped  an increase of approximately over and a decrease of approximately compared to  the best year in the industry s history 
the company s market share in the us trailer industry was approximately in the company s total new trailer shipments increased over and increased by over the demand for the company s products continues to be strong as the company began with approximately million in backlog  a majority of which is expected to be delivered in finally  although not a significant contributor to the company s results of operations  the company continues to pursue opportunities in international markets  primarily through the company s proprietary roadrailer technology 
in november   the company acquired a minority interest in a european roadrailer operating company in which exclusively roadrailer equipment is used to transport goods between italy and germany over the rails 
in addition  the company formed an affiliation with trailer manufacturer bernard krone fabrzeugwerke gmbh of wertle  germany for the marketing of dry vans and refrigerated trailers throughout europe 
the company believes these  and other opportunities provide the foundation for future growth internationally

the increase in net sales from to of million was attributable to increases in all facets of the company s business new trailer sales increased million  used trailer sales increased million  aftermarket parts and service increased million and finance company lease revenues increased million 
the increase in new trailer sales of million was attributable to a increase in the number of units sold  reflecting the impact of the newly acquired retail branch outlets  a increase in us truck trailer demand and continued strong demand for the company s products 
increased production of the company s proprietary composite plate trailer  the duraplate trailer  the next generation of the aluminum plate trailer  also favorably impacted net sales in  particularly in the fourth quarter 
historically  the aluminum plate trailer had accounted for over half of the company s revenues and even a greater percentage of its earnings 
while not proprietary  the company has enjoyed a sizable market share within this segment 
as the success of the aluminum plate trailer grew  the company experienced increased competition within its main product line and as a result  decreased margins 
with this in mind  the company developed and introduced in late the duraplate trailer which is proprietary in design 
the company s plate trailer production  including both aluminum and duraplate  increased in the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period in  and over in the fourth quarter of compared to the same period in prior to the fourth quarter of  the company was severely limited in the amount of composite plate material made available to it from its one supplier who was unable to add additional capacity 
as a result  during the first nine months of  the company s product mix was heavily weighted toward lower priced and lower margin commodity type trailers 
in august   the company completed the construction of its own composite material facility in lafayette  indiana and in the fourth quarter began using material from this production line for the assembly of new duraplate trailers 
the company believes this new facility will provide sufficient capacity for the company s foreseeable composite material requirements which call for continued increases in demand for this product 
the increase in aftermarket parts and service sales of million as well as the increase in used trailer sales of million as compared to is primarily the result of the addition of the retail branch distribution network 
the company s strategy to combine the largest fleet manufacturer with the largest retail distribution network in the us provided immediate benefits by creating critical synergies in the areas of aftermarket parts and service and used trailer sales  particularly the ability to market used trailer trade ins taken by the company against new trailer fleet orders 
the company recently announced its branch expansion plan which will increase the number of company owned retail branch outlets to approximately in the next two to three years 
the company believes the synergies between the fleet and retail business provides significant competitive advantages in the us truck trailer industry and the opportunity for continued sales growth 
the million increase in leasing and finance revenues during was primarily due to a full year of lease revenues on a large number of trailers added to the finance company s portfolio in late  as the overall number of trailers leased and financed to customers remained relatively constant with levels 
the decrease in sales of from to was the result of a decrease in industry new trailer shipments combined with the limited supply of composite material for the company s newly introduced duraplate trailer 
as a result  the company s production mix was heavily weighted toward lower priced and lower margin commodity trailers 
the increase in net sales from to was primarily attributed to a increase in industry new trailer shipments and strong demand for the company s products 
gross profit the company s gross profit as a percent of sales increased to compared to in and in this increase in gross profit percentage reflects the impact of higher margin sales from the retail branch outlets acquired in and the improvement in product mix resulting from the completion of the company s composite material facility in the third quarter of as expected  the gross margins recognized through the retail branch network during on sales of new and used trailers and aftermarket parts and service were significantly better than the historical margins achieved by the company on new trailer fleet business and contributed to the overall increase in the consolidated gross margin 
in addition  the completion of the company s composite material facility in august   allowed the company to increase its production of the proprietary duraplate trailer during the fourth quarter  thereby improving the product mix at the company s manufacturing facilities 
gross margin as a percent of sales in the fourth quarter of was approximately of net sales  compared to of net sales in the fourth quarter of based on current known trends  the company expects further improvement in gross margin as product mix continues to shift toward proprietary products like the duraplate trailer and as a larger percentage of the company s sales are generated from the retail network 
years ended december  dollar amounts in thousands gross profit    as a of net sales 
income from operations income from operations income before interest  taxes  and other items was  and of net sales in  and  respectively 
the increase in income from operations in was impacted primarily by the increase in gross profit margins previously discussed offset by increased selling  general and administrative expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses primarily reflects higher levels of expense associated with the retail outlets acquired 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  and of net sales in  and years ended december  dollar amounts in thousands income from operations 
   as a of net sales other income expense interest expense totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense primarily reflects new term and bank line of credit debt associated with increased working capital requirements due to the establishment of inventory at the fruehauf retail outlets acquired in the second quarter  higher working capital due to increased production at the company s manufacturing facilities and growth in the finance company s leasing operations 
other  net is primarily comprised of a variety of immaterial  non operating expense items

net cash used in operating and investing activities of million is the result of increased working capital due to the start up and growth in the retail branch network acquired in the second quarter of  increased production levels at the company s manufacturing facilities  capital expenditures related to the construction of the company s composite material facility and continued growth in the finance company s leasing operations 
the increase in working capital during was due to the company s investment of approximately million to establish working capital at the fruehauf retail outlets acquired in april  and higher inventory and receivables  offset somewhat by increased accounts payable  resulting from increased production at the company s manufacturing facilities 
the company has announced a branch expansion plan beginning in which will increase the number of company owned retail branch outlets from branches to approximately over the next two to three years and as a result  further working capital investments will be required to meet this expansion plan 
the company anticipates improvements in working capital at its manufacturing facilities in to partially offset the working capital needs within the retail branches 
capital expenditures during totaled approximately million and related principally to the construction of the company s composite material facility which was completed in the third quarter of in addition  investments in the finance company s leasing operations of approximately million were made during as the finance company continues to expand its leasing operations 
offsetting this investing activity were several transactions during the third and fourth quarters of totaling approximately million 
these transactions were comprised of million in sale and leaseback transactions occurring in september  involving a portion of the finance company s operating lease portfolio and a december  sale and leaseback transaction involving million of the company s manufacturing equipment 
the final transaction in december  of approximately million involved the sale  with recourse  by the finance company of certain of its finance contracts to a financial institution 
the acquisition of fruehauf in april  for million was financed through the issuance of million in common stock  million in preferred stock and the remaining million in cash 
the initial cash requirement for this acquisition was funded through the use of the company s revolving credit facility and was recovered within the first days following the acquisition through the positive cash flow generated from the sale of working capital acquired in the acquisition 
in connection with the investments discussed above  the company s debt increased to million at december  compared to million at december  of the million of consolidated debt outstanding at december   the finance company had million in outstanding borrowings as a result of its leasing activities compared to million at december  on september   the company replaced its revolving credit facility with an unsecured revolving bank line of credit permitting the company to borrow up to million 
under this facility  the company has the right to borrow until september  interest payable on such borrowings is variable based upon the london interbank rate libor plus to basis points or a prime rate of interest 
the company pays a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of this facility of to basis points per annum 
the company had available credit under this facility of million at december  in connection with one of the company s european roadrailer r sales transactions  the company is contingently liable for up to four years as a guarantor of certain commitments of two separate entities via standby letters of credit in the amount of million and a separate letter of guarantee in the amount of million 
during  the company continued to utilize a receivables sale and servicing agreement established in june   which enables the company to sell up to million of receivables without recourse 
these credit facilities are used for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
on april   the company announced that the board of directors authorized a common stock repurchase plan of up to million in the aggregate 
the company may purchase its common stock in the open market or in block transactions from time to time as it deems appropriate 
other sources of funds for capital expenditures  continued expansion of businesses including the branch expansion program  dividends  principal repayments on debt  stock repurchase and working capital requirements are expected to be cash from operations  additional borrowings under the credit facilities and term borrowings and equity offerings 
the company believes these funding sources will be adequate for its anticipated requirements 
the company has assessed and continues to assess the impact of the year issue on its reporting systems and operations 
the year issue exists because many computer systems and applications currently use two digit date fields to designate a year 
as the century date occurs  date sensitive systems will recognize the year as or not at all 
this inability to recognize or properly treat the year may cause our systems to process critical financial and operational information incorrectly 
one of the more significant year issues faced by the company are the systems in place within the company s retail distribution network  which are not year compliant 
as a result  in the company will install new application systems within this distribution network which will be year compliant 
the company does not expect the costs associated with becoming year compliant to be material 
inflation the company has been generally able to offset the impact of rising costs through productivity improvements as well as selective price increases 
as a result  inflation is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s business
