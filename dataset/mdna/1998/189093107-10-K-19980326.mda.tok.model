the company also expects to incur additional capital expenditures to expand its manufacturing capabilities 
the company s future capital requirements  however  will depend on numerous factors  including i the company s ability to manufacture and commercialize successfully its lead product  dermabond  ii the progress of its research and product development programs for future nonabsorbable and absorbable products  including clinical studies  iii the effectiveness of product commercialization activities and marketing agreements for its future products  including additional scale up of manufacturing capability in anticipation of product commercialization and development and progress of sales and marketing efforts  iv the ability of the company to maintain existing marketing agreements  including its agreement with ethicon for dermabond  and establish and maintain new marketing agreements  v the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing intellectual property rights and complying with regulatory requirements  vi the effect of competing technological and market developments and vii general economic conditions

if the company s currently available funds and internally generated cash flow are not sufficient to satisfy its financing needs  the company will be required to seek additional funding through bank borrowings and additional public or private sales of its securities  including equity securities  or through other arrangements with marketing partners 
other than the company s equipment financing line of credit and term loan  the company has no credit facility or other committed sources of capital 
there can be no assurance that additional funds  if required  will be available to the company on favorable terms  if at all
