nortel and ada will each contribute technology and development resources to projects conducted under the jda 
the companies will equally share development costs  estimated to be several million dollars per quarter 
development of the first product under the jda has commenced with initial availability expected in the first half of the agreement also contemplates additional projects as agreed to in the future by nortel and ada 
operating expenses for the year ended december  include a million offset to research and development costs representing nortel s proportionate share of development costs that have been incurred through december  in connection with the initial project being conducted under the jda 
in june  the company acquired an exclusive worldwide license to northern telecom s dss ii os software product  subject to certain residual rights retained by northern telecom 
the company acquired the license and certain assets related to the dss ii product for a net amount of million in cash  million of which was paid in and million of which was paid in january in june  the company recorded a charge of approximately million for purchased research and development associated with the acquisition of the license and assets 
as part of the transaction  the company also issued northern telecom a warrant to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrant has a three year term 
northern telecom retained the right to and will continue to support its current dss ii customer base outside of north america as part of its integrated network management portfolio for broadband network solutions 
the company obtained exclusive worldwide rights to market and sell the dss ii product under the new name  
provisioner  and acquired all of northern telecom s north american dss ii customer relationships 
the acquisition of 
provisioner was part of the company s strategic plan to build upon its portfolio of network management os software products essential to the operation of tsp networks 
the first part of the plan involved the acquisition by the company of its vancouver based development team known as british columbia group bcg from mpr teltech  ltd  a subsidiary of bc telecom  inc  in july bcg has been responsible for design  development  and maintenance of dss ii and its predecessor dss since  most recently under contract to northern telecom s network services management division 
in june  the company signed a three year supply contract with mci for the company s systems and services products 
this contract is a standard supply contract which specifies the terms and conditions under which mci will order and the company will supply products and services 
the contract is not a commitment contract and does not guarantee any purchases of products and services or any level of purchases 
although mci has purchased certain products of the company under the terms of this contract  the company is uncertain whether this contract will result in any future orders for the company s products  or if it does  whether the orders will result in significant revenue

revenue from network management os services and products totaled  in  a increase from  in the majority of the increase was the result of increased sales of software design services to northern telecom and sales of the company s 
provisioner software product to bc tel and mci 
since the company acquired its software design services business in july  the increased revenue in was mostly the result of a full year of software design services revenue 
the license of 
provisioner was acquired from northern telecom in june the acquisition of the software license from northern telecom has generated a shift in the company s bcg operations from a software design services business to a product business 
the company markets and supports the dss ii product and technology under the new name 
provisioner 
the company also intends to integrate the licensed technology into new product development 
although the company has continued to market and develop the software design services business  future revenue levels for software design services are expected to be significantly lower than in the past due to the shift in bcg s operations 
although the company believes it will be successful in transitioning the majority of its os operations from a software design services business to a product business  there can be no assurance the company will be able to maintain historical os revenue levels in the future 
as a result  the company may experience quarterly revenue fluctuations in the future that could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition

gross profit totaled  in  a increase from  in gross profit as a percent of revenue was in compared to in the increases in gross profit and gross profit as a percent of revenue resulted primarily from increased sales of higher margin network management os software products partially offset by decreased sales of network systems products as well as a change in product mix for network systems products from tas systems to a product mix weighted toward the company s cts and remote module niu products which carry lower product margins compared to the company s tas system 
the highly competitive cts and niu markets are subject to severe pressures which have contributed to significantly lower overall gross profits on these products 
additionally  gross profit for the year increased due to the shift of a majority of engineering labor previously associated with design services revenue from the cost of revenue line to research and development operating expenses as a result of the transition of most of bcg s operations from design services to product development 
during  the company transitioned the majority of bcg s operations from os software design services to os product development as a result of the acquisition of the license to the dss ii product from northern telecom 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain the current gross profit margins or gross profit as a percent of revenue levels 
factors which may materially and adversely affect the company s gross profit in the future include its level of revenue  competitive pricing pressures in the telecommunication network management market  new product introductions by the company or its competitors  potential inventory obsolescence and scrap  possible recalls  production or quality problems  timing of development expenditures  changes in material costs  disruptions in sources of supply  regulatory changes  seasonal patterns of bookings  capital spending  and changes in general economic conditions 
research and development expenses totaled  in  a increase from  in the increase was primarily due to a shift of a majority of engineering labor previously associated with design services revenue from the cost of revenue line to research and development operating expenses as a result of the transition of most of bcg s operations from design services to product development as discussed above in the gross profit analysis  and the addition of research and development personnel as part of the jda with nortel 
research and development personnel expenses increased compared to  mostly related to the shift in the bcg s operations to a product oriented business 
the company believes that its future success depends on its ability to maintain its technological leadership through enhancement of its existing products and development of innovative new products and services that meet customer needs 
therefore  the company intends to continue to make significant investments in research and product development in association with planned development projects 
the competition for highly qualified engineering personnel is intense 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel required to develop new products which could have a material adverse effect on the company s future operating results

gross profit totaled  in  a slight increase from  in gross profit as a percent of revenue was in compared to in the decrease in gross profit as a percent of revenue resulted primarily from a product mix weighted toward lower margin tas products and services and lower margin revenue from os software design services 
the majority of the company s canadian subsidiary s operations supported os software design services

per basic and diluted share in quarterly results the company has experienced significant fluctuations in bookings  revenue and operating results from quarter to quarter due to a combination of factors and expects such fluctuations to continue in future periods 
factors that may cause the company s results of operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter include but are not limited to the size and timing of customer orders and subsequent shipment of systems products and implementation of os software products to major customers  timing and market acceptance of product introductions or enhancements by the company or its competitors  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products  technological changes in the telecommunications industry  competitive pricing pressures  changes in the company s operating expenses  personnel changes  management of a changing business  changes in the mix of products sold and licensed  disruption in sources of supply  changes in pricing policies by the company s suppliers  regulatory changes  capital spending  delays of payments by customers and general economic conditions 
the company believes that in late it began experiencing seasonality in its product shipments and os software licensing 
generally  tsps place more orders for products and licenses in the second and fourth quarters with the orders significantly down in the first quarter and relatively flat in the third quarter of each year 
the company expects that revenue may begin to reflect these seasonal order cycles more closely  which could result in quarterly fluctuations 
there can be no assurance that the tsps will not defer or delay orders contrary to the historical seasonal pattern or that they will not change their ordering patterns 
because of the relatively fixed nature of most of the company s costs  including personnel and facilities costs  any unanticipated shortfall in revenue in any fiscal quarter would have a proportionately greater impact on the company s operating income in that quarter and may result in fluctuations in the price of the company s common stock 
as the impact of the company s network management business unit on the company s revenue increases  the company may be faced with greater fluctuations in operating income 
the licensing and implementation of the company s os products generally involves a significant capital expenditure and a committment of resources by prospective customers 
accordingly  the company is dependent on its customers decisions as to the the timing and level of commitment and expenditures 
in addition  the company typically realizes a significant portion of license revenues in the last weeks or even days of a quarter 
as a result  the magnitude of quarterly fluctuations in the network management business unit may not become evident until late in  or after the close of  a particular quarter 
in addition  the company does not recognize service revenues until the services are rendered 
the time required to implement the company s os products can vary significantly with the needs of its customers and is generally a process that extends for several months 
because of their complexity  larger implementations may take multiple quarters to complete 
additionally  quarter to quarter product mix variations  customer orders tending to be placed late in the quarter  and competitive pressures on pricing could have a materially adverse effect on the company s operating results in any one quarter 
the company s expenses are based in part on the company s expectations as to future revenues and to a large extent are fixed in the short term 
if revenues do not meet expectations  the company s business  operations and financial condition are likely to be materially adversely affected 
liquidity and capital resources cash and investments totaled  at december  and  at december  the decrease in cash and investments compared to is primarily due to cash payments for the acquisition of the dss ii license from northern telecom  purchases of property and equipment and operating losses 
net working capital totaled  at december  and  at december  the decrease in working capital compared to was primarily the result of a decrease in cash and investments and increased accounts payable associated with inventory purchases for fourth quarter revenue shipments  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
the company s operating activities used  in cash primarily the result of increased accounts receivable resulting from a majority of the company s fourth quarter sales occurring late in the quarter and increased operating expenses related to internal funding of the jda with nortel  partially offset by increased accounts payable and decreased inventory levels 
in  the company s operating activities used  in cash primarily as a result of net operating losses 
in  the purchase cost of the dss ii license acquisition totaled  of which all but  had been paid in cash by year end 
the tangible assets acquired as part of the dss ii license acquisition consisted mostly of computer and lab equipment 
cash used for capital expenditures totaled approximately  in and  in most of the capital additions were for the purchase of computers  lab equipment and software tool kits to support the company s expanded research and product development efforts  improvements to the company s internal network infrastructure to support the company s multiple locations and the bcg operations move to a new facility in february the company did not acquire any capital equipment through capital lease arrangements in or the company expects that the level of capital expenditures will increase in as a result of planned facility moves in richardson  texas and planned research and development projects 
assuming no material changes in the company s current operating plans  the company believes that cash generated from operations and the total of its cash and investments  will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
significant additional capital resources  however  may be required to fund acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies 
alternatively  the company may need to issue additional shares of its capital stock or incur indebtedness in connection with any such acquisitions 
at present  the company does not have any agreements or commitments with respect to any such acquisition and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such agreements or commitments on reasonable terms  or at all 
the company believes the impact of inflation on its business activities has not been significant to date
