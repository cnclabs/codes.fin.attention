item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s results of operations are significantly affected by the timing of the award of contracts  the timing of performance on contracts  and the extent to which the company s employees are performing billable tasks as opposed to engaging in preparing contract proposals  bids and other required non billable activities 
results of operations may also be affected to the extent that the company chooses not to reduce its professional staff during a period of reduced demand for its services 
due to these factors  quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for longer periods 
the company  in the course of providing its services  routinely subcontracts such services as drilling  certain laboratory analyses  and other specialized services 
in addition  as described in the general section of item  the use of teaming partners for the performance of services similar to those of the company  is included in subcontracts 
in accordance with industry practice and contract terms that generally provide for the recovery of overhead costs  these costs are passed directly through to clients and are included in total revenue 
because subcontractor costs and direct charges can change significantly from project to project  the change in total revenue is not necessarily a true indication of business trends 
accordingly  the company considers net revenue  which is total revenue less subcontractor costs  as its primary measure of revenue 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationships of selected items in the consolidated statement of operations to net revenue for the years indicated 
for historical comparisons  operating costs in past years have been adjusted to include sales and marketing related costs in sales  general  and administrative costs 
in previous years  these costs were included in direct salaries and other operating expenses 
year ended august  net revenue operating expenses direct salaries and other operating expenses sales  general and administrative gain on key employee life insurance restructuring charges total operating expenses income loss from operations interest expense  net income loss before income taxes benefit from provision for income taxes net income loss fiscal compared to fiscal net revenue during fiscal increased to  from  this  increase is due in part to the recognition of contract losses related to certain landfill contracts in fiscal the loss provision for these contracts  a business line the company no longer pursues  recognized anticipated future project expenses which lowered fiscal net revenue by  adjusting for this loss recognition  net revenue in fiscal decreased by 
the overall decrease in net revenue is due to lower than anticipated sales in the industrial sector 
although sales and marketing efforts have targeted this market and won approximately new clients  larger volume projects have not been achieved as of the end of the fiscal period 
lower industrial sector sales were offset by improved net sales in the federal  state and local government  and utility sectors 
direct salaries and other operating costs decreased to  in from  in  or and of net revenue  respectively 
the decreases were attributable to increased staff utilization and lower overall non labor operating costs 
the company maintained a utilization rate time charged to clients of more than for its technical staff and an overall company rate of 
significant savings were also achieved by lowering equipment and property lease costs by  in fiscal compared to fiscal these savings were achieved by subletting unused facilities  renegotiating existing leases  and changing to a different supplier for computer related items 
sales  general and administrative costs increased to  in from  in  or and of net revenue  respectively 
the increase in cost was primarily related to additional investment in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal compared to the prior year 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a gain of  reducing its operating expenses 
the gain was related to the increase in the cash surrender value of key employee life insurance policies included on the company s balance sheet 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company implemented a major organizational realignment to reposition itself in the marketplace 
in connection with the restructuring  the company incurred charges of  related to severance  planned reduction in office space  the suspension of the implementation of a new project financial system  and other related costs 
this restructuring included a staff reduction of employees 
during fiscal  the company incurred  in operating related costs that were associated with the fy restructuring and charged against the reserve instead of income 
as a result of the above factors  the income from operations in fiscal was  compared to a loss from operations of  in the prior year 
interest expense  net  decreased to  from the prior year s total of  this decrease is attributed to lower interest paid in connection with the company s line of credit  reduction of certain long term debt principal balances  and the absence of an interest payment in connection with a maryland tax settlement in fiscal the net income for the twelve months ended august   was  or of net revenue  compared to a net loss of  or of net revenue for the prior year 
fiscal compared to fiscal net revenue during fiscal decreased to  from  the decrease was attributable to lower contract volume associated with the department of defense  industrial  and federal non dod agency activities 
also  realized losses related to certain landfill projects amounting to approximately  of costs in excess of contract values were recognized in fiscal  further reducing net revenue 
additionally  price competition remained intense within the environmental services industry  further suppressing net revenue levels compared to the prior year 
due to the aforementioned restructuring  direct salaries and other operating costs decreased to  from  as a percentage of net revenue  however  direct salaries and other operating costs increased to from a year earlier 
this increase was primarily attributable to lower staff utilization  especially in the second quarter  related to a reduction in available work  which produced an increase in operating costs relative to net revenue 
in march  the company implemented a major organizational realignment to reposition itself in the marketplace 
in connection with the restructuring  the company incurred charges of  during the third quarter related to severance  planned reduction in office space  the suspension of the implementation of a new project financial system  and other related costs 
this restructuring included a staff reduction of approximately employees 
sales  general and administrative costs increased to  in from  in  or and of net revenue  respectively 
the increase was due primarily to bonus amounts paid to management as a result of the company s exceeding its profit targets for the final five months of the year 
no bonuses were paid in fiscal as a result of the above factors  the loss from operations in fiscal was  compared to a loss from operations of  in the prior year 
interest expense  net  decreased slightly to  from  a net decrease in interest expense from lower than average borrowings was offset by higher rates and an interest payment made in connection with a state income tax settlement 
the benefit from income taxes was  for the year ended august   compared to a benefit from income taxes of  for the year ended  representing effective rates of and  respectively 
the difference in effective tax rates between years is largely attributable to increases in certain permanent differences between financial and income tax reporting  and to the non recognition of the future benefits attributable to a foreign loss for the fiscal year ended it is the opinion of management that these recorded benefits are more likely than not to be realized 
the net loss for the twelve months ended august   was  or of net revenue  compared to net loss of  or of net revenue for the prior year 
analysis by segment the following table provides selected financial information by segment year ended august  gross sales management consulting services external    management consulting services internal    total management consulting services gross    analytical services external    analytical services internal    total analytical services gross    net sales to unaffiliated customers management consulting services    analytical services    income loss from operations management consulting services    analytical services    identifiable assets net property and equipment management consulting services    analytical services    note sales are considered external when a segment directly enters into a contract with a client 
internal sales are generated by the use of the company s analytical services required by the external clients of management consulting services 
internal sales are duplicated within each segment and are eliminated through intercompany adjustments 
results net sales for management consulting services decreased in the fiscal period ended august  to  from  in fiscal this decrease is due to the lower than anticipated sales in the industrial sector 
net sales in analytical services increased in fiscal to  from  in fiscal this increase is mainly attributable to a new contract with an industrial client 
the management consulting services segment contributed  or of net revenue  to income from operations in fiscal year  compared to a loss from operations of  or of net revenue  in the prior year 
this improvement is due to a year to year reduction in segment costs and operating expenses 
cost and operating cost savings were due to increased staff utilization  fiscal year restructuring efforts  and savings in equipment and property leases 
the analytical services segment had a loss from operations of  or of net revenue for the fiscal period ended august  compared to a loss from operations of  or of net revenue  the prior fiscal year 
the improvement in earnings is mainly attributable to the  increase in net revenue in fiscal year  offset by a slight increase to the segment s costs and operating expenses 
because the analytical services segment has a high percentage of overall fixed indirect expenses approximately of indirect operating costs  changes in net revenue significantly impact its contribution to operating income 
results net sales for management consulting services fell to  for the fiscal period ended august   compared to  for the period ended august  this decrease was attributable to lower contract volume with the federal government and realized losses related to certain landfill projects amounting to approximately  in costs in excess of contract volume 
additionally  price competition remained intense within this segment  further suppressing sales 
net sales for analytical services also fell to  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal the decrease in sales was mainly attributable to the  decrease in intercompany sales provided by the clients of management consulting services 
management consulting services had a loss from operations of  or of net revenue  in fiscal  compared to a  income from operations in fiscal the decrease in income from operations was due to lower sales in fiscal and  in restructuring charges taken in fiscal analytical services had a loss from operations of  or of net sales  in fiscal  compared to a loss from operations of  or  in fiscal the increased loss from operations was due to lower sales 
inflation because of its ability to generally pass through increased costs to its clients  as well as the generally low levels of inflation  the company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its operations 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents cash decreased by  in  compared to an increase of  in and a decrease of  in the decrease in principally resulted from the payout of cash related to the fiscal restructuring expenses and reduced borrowings from the company s revolving line of credit  aided by the collection of income tax refunds 
the company s capital expenditures consisting primarily of purchases of equipment and leasehold improvements of approximately   and  in   and  respectively  have been funded primarily from cash flows 
near the end of fiscal  the company entered into a new bank credit arrangement with a regional bank consisting of i an  revolving line of credit secured by receivables  ii a  term loan  and iii an equipment line of credit of  of the  revolving line of credit   is available for acquisitions  joint ventures and licensing agreements 
borrowings from the revolving line of credit are limited to certain percentages of accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings up to a maximum of 
the interest on all borrowings was libor  through march however  the interest was reduced to libor in may due to the company achieving certain financial ratios  which the company expects to be reduced to libor in the first quarter of fiscal at august   the company had outstanding long term debt  including the current portion  of  which represented a decrease of  from the august  balance of  the company had no short term borrowings under its line of credit at august  and the company s existing funds  cash from operations  and the available portion of its  bank line of credit and  equipment line are expected to be sufficient to meet the company s present cash needs 
the company also currently believes it has the ability to raise capital through placement of debt and may pursue such options if the need arises to expand facilities  make acquisitions or acquire equipment in conjunction with a review of the most cost effective means for the company and its stockholders 
while the company believes that there is sufficient demand for current operating levels  there can be no assurance that this demand will exist or continue 
although the company has the ability to reduce its professional staff in periods of reduced demand  it may choose not to make full reductions in such periods  with resulting adverse effects on operations 
year readiness disclosures ea engineering  science  and technology  inc ea or the company recognizes the seriousness of the challenge businesses worldwide face as a result of the year problem 
ea formally began to address its own year status in early the company believes the measures it has already taken  together with those planned for  will minimize any impact the year problem may have on ea s ability to deliver services to its clients  financial performance or results of operations 
definitions during fiscal  ea developed a three phase program for year compliance 
phase i identified those systems  hardware and software that posed a compliance risk for ea 
phase ii assessed the business and financial impact of these at risk systems  established priorities to address these risk areas  and prescribed remediation schedules and details 
phase iii is the final testing of the major systems to ensure compliance 
assessment ea s information technology infrastructure can be broadly categorized into the following major systems networking and communication systems  desktop computing  major application systems  ea laboratory  non information technology non it and other miscellaneous systems 
the company s phase i assessment identified several critical elements of ea s networking and communications infrastructure that are potentially vulnerable to year issues 
these elements include various types of computer servers and network routers 
additionally  various software components require new revision to ensure compliance 
numerous databases and database access programs are currently believed to be non compliant 
ea s desktop computing environment is comprised predominantly of compaq desktop computer systems  ibm notebooks  the microsoft windows operating system and numerous versions and variations of commercially available software 
the majority of the desktop computer systems  notebooks and operating system software with applicable yk patches  is currently believed to be year compliant 
ea leases all of its computer hardware and consequently replaces all equipment on a three year schedule 
this rotation minimizes any year problems in this area 
desktop application software varies greatly in its ability to accurately process year information 
it is currently believed that the company s major applications  including its financial management  human resources  and laboratory lims systems are not year compliant 
however  a full assessment was not completed on these systems because they are scheduled for replacement in the upcoming fiscal period 
these systems are being replaced to improve their performance and functionality 
replacement of these systems was not accelerated due to the year issue 
ea s laboratory is comprised of many different models of hewlett packard laboratory equipment 
the hardware is currently believed to be compliant 
the system level software used on this equipment is still under review 
the non it and miscellaneous category includes items such as phone switches  voice mail systems  environmental controls systems  and the like 
the phone switches are believed to be year compliant 
the voice mail system and other remaining systems are currently under review 
remediation replacement networking and communications systems in early calendar  ea restructured its network topology 
the company currently believes that this redefinition will significantly upgrade ea s overall communications capabilities  improve reliability and performance  and believes it will be year compliant 
this upgrade will be accomplished through the replacement of all critical system components that have potential year problems 
two of four critical field systems have already been replaced 
the remaining two will be completed by the spring of the upgrading of the ea corporate headquarters systems is underway and will be completed during the first quarter of calendar ea selected mci worldcom as its communications services provider 
mci worldcom has advised ea that it is fully year compliant 
coincident with the hardware upgrades  ea is upgrading its database capabilities to be year compliant 
the database capabilities are presently expected to be in place during the first quarter of calendar ea has retained a consultant to convert all applicable databases to compliant software 
these database conversions will continue through the first three quarters of calendar desktop computing to address ea s desktop software computing environment  ea standardized on the microsoft office suite of application products in the second quarter of fiscal the ms office product is not fully compliant 
any remaining non compliant applications are being addressed on a project by project basis 
we anticipate this process to be completed in the third quarter of calendar major applications ea plans to replace its financial management  human resources and laboratory systems in the company has selected financial and laboratory packages that are fully year compliant 
the process to replace these systems will begin in december of we anticipate these systems to be fully operational by the end of the third calendar quarter of the company is completing its review of fully compliant human resources systems 
once selected  the implementation will begin in january and is expected to be completed in april ea laboratories as part of the ea laboratories maintenance agreement with hewlett packard hp  the manufacturer will be completing an independent review of the labs hardware and software systems during november this review will be at no cost to ea laboratories 
we have already determined the laboratory hardware is compliant 
hp s review will confirm this assessment and provide additional insight into the status of the software required to operate this equipment 
any deficiencies with this software will be addressed early in non it and miscellaneous systems phone switches in the branch offices are currently under review 
the manufacturer of our voice mail systems is currently providing input regarding the status of the systems 
should year upgrades be required for these systems  they will be performed during the first half of we will begin a formal review of our environmental control and facility systems early in issues with these systems will be addressed as they are identified 
testing ea has tested and will continue to test  the year worthiness of each upgraded system  as it is installed 
in each case  eg  desktop systems  networks  major systems  etc  this compliance testing is comprised of three independent assessments first  review of the product manufacturer s year compliance testing certifications and results no product is selected unless it has been identified by the manufacturer to have passed a comprehensive battery of year tests  second  testing of these products prior to installation  third  outside consultants or subcontractors will conduct independent assessments of all of these products 
risks and contingency plans based on the progress the company has made toward year compliance during  together with its plans for  the company does not foresee significant risks associated with these efforts at this time 
since ea has adopted a plan to address these issues in a timely manner  it has not developed a comprehensive contingency plan should these issues fail to be completed successfully or in their entirety 
however  as we monitor our progress during  if the company identifies significant risks or is unable to meet its anticipated timeline  the company will develop contingency plans as deemed necessary at that time 
third party vendors  utilities and customers the fact that ea provides environmental consulting services  which are primarily labor based  substantially minimizes the risks associated with potential year problems with its internal systems and suppliers 
the company maintains a broad base of vendors and suppliers and believes there is little risk to its ongoing operations from year problems encountered by its outside vendors 
ea will be contacting each of its major vendors and utilities early in calendar to inquire into each system s year compliance 
the company cannot fully assess the degree to which its customers  particularly the us government  will successfully complete a year upgrade on a timely basis 
because a significant portion of the company s business is from contracts with various federal government agencies  a failure by the us government to achieve year compliance could have a significant adverse effect on the company s future business  financial operations and results of operations 
reasonably likely worst case scenarios ea has gone to significant lengths to provide redundancy in each major system 
for example  four independent communication paths have been defined between ea s branch offices and its headquarters location 
any of these paths will provide data access to the systems required to continue normal business operations 
a failure in any single major system will not result in the cessation of normal work processes 
when fully implemented during the final quarter of  the failure of any single system will pose only a minimal risk 
the greatest reasonably likely  worst case scenario to ea will be from the outside  primarily customers and subcontractors 
if our customers or subcontractors fail to prepare adequately for year  there could be numerous and significant effects on ea 
for example  subcontractors may not be able to obtain or deliver needed data  ea employees might be unable to perform work  resulting in a loss of revenue  payments may fail to arrive on time 
any or all of these contingencies could  under certain circumstances  result in a substantial and material impact on ea s financial performance 
costs to address year issues in summary  the company does not believe that yk costs will have a material impact to its operating income 
because the company leases all of its hardware  remediation of these items will be completed by replacing them  with the associated lease expense included in the company s normal operating costs 
the cost of remediation of database software  miscellaneous desktop software upgrades  and non it systems is expected to be less than  however  it is possible that non compliant hewlett packard software in ea laboratories may have a material impact  although the exact amount is not known at this time 
the replacement of major applications was previously planned to improve performance and functionality requirements 
these replacements were not accelerated due to year issues  as such the costs of these systems are part of the company s capital budget
