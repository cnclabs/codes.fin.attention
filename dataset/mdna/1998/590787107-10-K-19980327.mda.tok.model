the company expects to experience significant fluctuations in its future quarterly operating results 
these fluctuations will be due to several factors  many of which are beyond the control of the company  including  among others  market response to the company s interactive messaging platform  difficulties encountered in the development or deployment of products or services  including interactive messaging  market acceptance of internet commerce in general and fvips and the virtualpin architecture in particular  fluctuating market demand for the company s products and services  the monthly volume and average dollar amount of transactions using fvips  the degree of acceptance of the internet as an advertising and merchandising medium  the fees charged to the company by third party processors and financial institutions  the timing and effectiveness of collaborative marketing efforts initiated by the company s strategic partners  the timing of the introduction of new products and services offered by the company  the timing of the release of enhancements to the company s products and services  product introductions and service offerings by the company s competitors  the mix of the products and services provided by the company  the timing and rate at which the company increases its expenses to support projected growth  the cost of compliance with applicable government regulations  competitive conditions in the company s marketplace  and general economic conditions 
in addition  the fees charged by the company for consumer and merchant registration  advertising  messaging  consulting services  transaction processing and co marketing are subject to change as the company introduces its interactive marketing platform  develops its virtualtag software toolkit  and assesses its marketing strategy and competitive position

take advantage of opportunities or respond to competition  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
in october  the company received net proceeds of million from a private placement of securities 
prior to the october private placement  the company financed its operations primarily through the approximate million net proceeds that was raised in its ipo on december  the company  prior to the ipo  had raised million from the sale and issuance of its preferred stock  common stock and warrants  and million of principal under stockholder lines of credit 
holders of certain promissory notes the noteholders filed civil actions against the company seeking to recover the principal and interest which they allege is due 
if the company is unable to obtain significant new financing  and if there is no favorable resolution of the lawsuit or an acceptable settlement with the noteholders  the company intends to seek relief under chapter of the us bankruptcy code chapter  in order to protect the interests of its employees  stockholders and other constituents 
regardless of whether the company is compelled to seek protection under chapter  the company s ability to continue to operate in accordance with its plan  or at all  will be severely jeopardized as a result of the noteholder lawsuit 
see item legal proceedings 
operating activities used cash of million during the year ended december  net cash used during this period was primarily to fund net operating expenses of million excluding depreciation and amortization  reduce accounts payable and other accrued liabilities by  pay down amounts due to stockholders of  and increase prepaid expenses  deposits and accounts receivable by  offset by increases in deferred revenue of  and accrued interest of  capital expenditures have been  and future capital expenditures are expected to be  primarily for facilities  furniture and capital equipment to support the expansion of the company s operations and management information systems 
capital expenditures were  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
furniture and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over three to five years using the straight line method 
year compliance many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
beginning in the year  these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  in approximately two years  computer systems and or software used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
significant uncertainty exists concerning the potential effects associated with compliance 
although the company believes that it is year compliant  there can be no assurance that coding errors or other defects will not be discovered in the future 
any year compliance problem of the company  its service providers  its customers or the internet infrastructure could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial conditions 
factors affecting operating results and market price of stock first virtual operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of uncertainties  some of which are beyond the company s control 
in addition to the uncertainties described elsewhere in this report  these uncertainties include history of operating losses and anticipated future losses  limited operating history the company has incurred net operating losses in each quarter since its inception in march as of december   the company had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
to date  the this statement is a forward looking statement reflecting current expectations 
there can be no assurance that the actual future results will meet the company s current expectations 
investors are strongly encouraged to review the section entitled factors affecting operating results and market price of stock commencing on page  for a discussion of factors that could affect future performance 
the reader is cautioned that other sections not so identified may also contain forward looking information 
company has not generated significant revenues 
there can be no assurance that the company s revenues will increase in the future 
in addition  as a result of the anticipated significant investment that the company is making and plans to continue to make in its systems  sales  marketing  research  development and engineering  customer care and administrative infrastructure over the near term  the company expects to continue to incur significant operating losses on both a quarterly and an annual basis for the foreseeable future 
for these and other reasons  there can be no assurance that the company will ever achieve or be able to sustain profitability 
the company and its business prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in the new and rapidly evolving market for internet products and services 
there can be no assurance that the company will succeed in addressing any or all of these risks  and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company commenced operations in march  and accordingly the company has a limited operating history upon which to base an evaluation of its business and prospects 
to date  substantially all of the company s revenues have been attributable to the receipt of registration fees from consumers and merchants  transaction processing fees  merchandising fees  sales of vtags and consulting fees associated with fvips 
while the company has historically devoted its efforts to developing and marketing fvips  the company has recently determined to dedicate substantial resources to developing and implementing its interactive messaging system and related services and technologies 
the company s future financial performance will depend significantly on the successful development  introduction and customer acceptance of the interactive messaging platform and other new and enhanced products and services 
demand for new product categories such as the interactive messaging system is inherently difficult to predict  and the company believes that its prior experience in developing and operating fvips does not offer a meaningful basis to assess the future prospects of the interactive messaging system and related products and services 
accordingly  there is no assurance that a significant market for the interactive messaging system  or for any other technologies or services of the company  will develop  or that the company will be successful in marketing the interactive messaging platform  fvips or any new or enhanced products or services 
uncertainty of nasdaq national market listing  dilution from recently completed financing  need for additional capital prior to mid year  uncertainty of additional financing in october  the company completed a private placement of securities consisting of  shares of series a convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock 
because the series a preferred stock is convertible into common stock at a discount below the current market price of the common stock and because the price at which such conversion may be effected is the lesser of or of the average closing bid price per share of common stock for the prior ten days  conversion of the series a preferred stock will result in at least modest dilution to existing investors  and may result in substantial dilution 
additional dilution may result upon the exercise of the common stock warrants issued in this financing 
in addition  the company believes that the sale of common stock issued upon conversion of the series a preferred stock has exerted  and will continue to exert  significant downward pressure on the market price of the common stock 
moreover  holders of series a preferred stock enjoy certain rights and preferences which may adversely affect holders of common stock  including a right to quarterly dividend payments and a right to a preference payment in the event of a liquidation or dissolution of the company 
moreover  the company will need to raise additional funds to fund its operations  as well as to develop new or enhanced services  to respond to competitive pressures or to acquire complementary businesses or technologies 
if adequate funds are not secured  the company s ability to operate in accordance with its plans  or at all  will be severely jeopardized 
in addition  any failure by the company to raise adequate equity funding by march  may cause the nasdaq stock market to discontinue the listing of the company s common stock on the nasdaq national market 
the company has scheduled a hearing before a committee of the nasdaq board of governors on april  with respect to its listing status on the nasdaq national market 
any such action by the nasdaq stock market would adversely affect the liquidity and market price of the common stock 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of the stockholders of the company will be further reduced  stockholders may experience significant additional dilution and such equity securities may also have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of the company s common stock 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed or that if available  such financing will include terms favorable to the company or its stockholders 
in addition  the company s ability to raise additional funds prior to the end of april without the consent of the holders of series a preferred stock is subject to certain limitations 
if adequate funds cannot be obtained or are not available on acceptable terms  the company may be unable to develop or enhance its products and services  take advantage of important opportunities or respond to competitive pressures  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
anticipated fluctuations in quarterly operating results as a result of the early stage of development of internet commerce and the interactive messaging platform  and the relatively recent dates of commercial introduction of fvips  virtualtags and the company s limited operating history  the company s revenue expectations are based almost entirely on internal estimates of future demand and not on actual experience 
in particular  it is difficult to forecast revenue expectations for the interactive messaging platform  since currently  the interactive messaging platform strategy is under development 
moreover  the company has only limited historical financial data for quarterly or annual periods on which to base planned operating expenses 
the company s expense levels have been established in large part due to its current expectations for future revenues and its expected development and marketing requirements 
in the event market demand and revenues do not meet expectations  the company may be unable to adjust its spending levels on a timely basis to compensate for unexpected revenue shortfalls 
to a certain extent  the company has encountered this problem to date 
as a result  the company has not and may not be able to take advantage of revenue opportunities as quickly as it would hope  because of an effort to scale down its infrastructure to match lower than expected revenues 
there can be no assurance that revenues associated with use of the interactive messaging platform  fvips or internet related consulting will increase significantly  or at all 
any material shortfall of demand for the company s products and services would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial condition and could cause significant fluctuations in the company s results of operations 
the company expects its future operating results over both the short and the long term will be subject to annual and quarterly fluctuations due to several factors  many of which are beyond the control of the company  including  among others  market response to the company s interactive messaging platform  difficulties encountered in the development or deployment of products or services  including interactive messaging  market acceptance of internet commerce in general and fvips and the virtualpin and virtualtag concept in particular  fluctuating market demand for the company s products and services including the rate of merchant and consumer registrations  the monthly volume and average dollar amount of transactions using fvips  the degree of acceptance of the internet as an advertising and merchandising medium  the fees charged to the company by third party processors and financial institutions  the timing and effectiveness of collaborative marketing efforts initiated by the company s strategic partners  the timing of the introduction of new products and services offered by the company  the timing of the release of enhancements to the company s products and services  product introductions and service offerings by the company s competitors  the mix of the products and services provided by the company  the timing and rate at which the company increases its expenses to support projected growth  the cost of compliance with applicable government regulations  competitive conditions in the company s marketplace  and general economic conditions 
in addition  the fees charged by the company for consumer and merchant registration  advertising  messaging  consulting services  transaction processing and co marketing are subject to change as the company introduces its interactive marketing platform  introduces its virtualtag software toolkit  and assesses its marketing strategy and competitive position 
the company believes that period to period comparisons of its operating results are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance 
due to the foregoing factors  among others  it is probable and possible  that the company s future quarterly or annual operating results from time to time will not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors  which may have a material adverse effect on the price of the company s common stock 
risks related to product transition the company has derived substantially all of it revenues to date from fvips  virtualtags and related services 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company determined to refocus it resources on developing and commercializing the interactive messaging platform 
since development of the technologies underlying the interactive messaging platform has not been completed  and since the interactive messaging platform has not yet been implemented other than on a test basis  no assurance can be given that development of the interactive messaging platform will be successfully completed or that the cost of development will not exceed future revenues generated by the interactive messaging platform 
in addition  there is no assurance that the company s current server capacity and communications systems will be adequate to support high volumes of interactive messaging platform usage 
a key element of the company s strategy is to generate a high volume of messages and associated transactions through the interactive messaging platform and fvips 
accordingly  the performance of the company s products and services is critical to the company s ability to achieve market acceptance and continued use of these products and services 
significant increases in the volume of messages processed by the company s systems could strain the capacity of the company s software or hardware  which could lead to slower response time or system failures 
any additional investment in enhancing the capacity of the company s server and communications systems may adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results  and may result in service delays and interruptions that would adversely impact the company s revenues and reputation 
moreover  the development and introduction of the interactive messaging platform has required the company to substantially curtail the resources devoted to development and enhancement of fvips and related technologies and services  and has limited the ability of the company s management and marketing and sales staff to pursue the company s goal of increasing fvips usage  sales of virtualtags and merchant and consumer registrations 
unless the interactive messaging platform is successfully introduced and marketed  and unless revenues from the interactive messaging platform are sufficient to return the cost of its development and to compensate for adverse effect on fvips related and virtualtag related revenues  the company s business  financial condition and results of operation will be materially and adversely affected 
uncertain acceptance of interactive messaging services the company s future success depends to a significant degree on the company s ability to successfully market the interactive messaging platform and related services 
the interactive messaging platform has not yet been commercially introduced and the company has to date not secured any significant customer commitments to license  use or implement the interactive messaging platform 
moreover  market demand for new product and service categories such as interactive messaging is inherently uncertain 
the interactive messaging platform represents a departure from the traditional methods of marketing and information exchange employed by the company s target customers  who have typically relied predominantly on advertising and direct mail to attract new customers and maintain customer relationships 
acceptance of the interactive messaging platform will require a transition to new ways of conducting business by enterprises that have already made substantial investments in other means of conducting commerce and exchanging information 
accordingly  the market prospects for the interactive messaging platform are highly uncertain 
moreover  although the company believes that the interactive messaging platform will prove to be an efficient and cost effective marketing and relationship management vehicle for a broad variety of customers  there is no assurance that prospective customers will be able to implement the interactive messaging platform without substantial additional cost  or that the cost efficiency of the interactive messaging platform will compare favorably with traditional methods of marketing and information exchange for most customers 
failure of the interactive messaging system to meet customers demands for efficacy and cost efficiency may result in a decline in use of the company s interactive messaging services over time and would materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on distribution relationships  collateral systems and expansion of direct sales force a key element of the company s current business and marketing strategy is to establish  develop and maintain relationships with credit card issuers  catalog companies  direct marketers  travel services  which include airlines  rental cars agencies and hotel operators  to promote the company s products and services to their merchant and consumer customers 
although the company has established relationships with such entities in an effort to enhance the company s ability to penetrate the market for interactive messaging and internet payment services  such relationships are nonexclusive and have not resulted in any comprehensive or measurable increase in the company s revenues to date 
for instance  in the company granted certain equity incentives to first data corporation fdc and general electric capital corporation gecc  in order to induce fdc and gecc to meet certain goals for promoting fvips usage 
fdc and gecc did not meet the performance targets and the equity incentives expired 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to develop strategic relationships or that any such relationship will prove to be effective in creating demand for the interactive messaging platform or in expanding the company s merchant and consumer base 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s existing or potential marketing partners  most of whom have significantly greater financial and marketing resources than the company  will not change their business strategies or discontinue their relationships with the company  develop and market products and services that compete with the company s products and services in the future or form collaborative marketing relationships with one or more of the company s competitors that offer alternative internet commerce solutions 
the operation of the interactive messaging platform and fvips is dependent on the continued availability and reliability of collateral telecommunications 
fvips is also dependent on the continued availability and reliability of information processing and financial clearance systems 
in particular  the company is substantially dependent on paymentech inc  northern trust company and electronic data systems  inc for certain financial transactions services relating to the operation of fvips 
in addition  the company is substantially dependent on mci communications corp 
and worldcom inc for collateral telecommunication services 
there can be no assurance that these companies will continue to provide collateral services to the company without disruptions in service  at the current cost  or at all 
although the company believes that such services could be obtained from other sources in due course if required  reengineering the company s computer systems and telecommunications infrastructure to accommodate a new service provider could only be accomplished at significant cost and with significant delay 
any interruption of service by a collateral services provider also would be likely to result in the disruption of the operation of the interactive messaging platform and fvips  with an attendant loss of revenues and potential loss of customers 
such losses could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in order to promote the use of the interactive messaging platform and to increase market acceptance of fvips  the company will be required to significantly expand its direct sales force and marketing organization and manage such personnel effectively 
establishing required marketing and sales capability will require substantial efforts and significant management and financial resources 
the company s management has very limited experience in recruiting  developing or managing a marketing and sales force 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to recruit and retain direct marketing and sales personnel in order to build an effective marketing and sales organization  that building such a marketing and sales organization will be cost effective or that the company s marketing and sales efforts will be successful 
undeveloped and rapidly changing markets the markets for the company s products and services are at a very early stage of development  are rapidly changing and are characterized by an increasing number of market entrants that have introduced or are developing competing products and services for use on the internet and the web 
as is typical for a new and rapidly evolving industry  demand for and market acceptance of recently introduced products and services are subject to a high level of uncertainty and risk 
acceptance and usage of the interactive messaging platform is dependent on continued growth in use of e mail as a primary means of communications by businesses and consumers 
increased usage of interactive messaging is also contingent on acceptance of e mail as a vehicle for targeted marketing of products and services  and on the ability of the company to successfully differentiate its services from random mass e mailing products and services which have encountered substantial resistance from consumers 
similarly  increased usage of fvips is contingent on substantial and sustained growth in sales of consumer products and services on the web 
businesses that already have invested substantial resources in traditional or other methods of conducting business may be reluctant to adopt new commercial methodologies or strategies that may limit or compete with their existing businesses 
individuals with established patterns of purchasing goods and services may be reluctant to alter those patterns 
accordingly  it is not assured that sufficient demand for the company s products and services will develop to sustain the company s business 
the company s success is critically dependent on the significant expansion of the internet infrastructure in order to provide adequate internet access  the proper management of internet traffic and a substantial amount of public education to  among other things  increase confidence in the integrity and security of internet commerce 
there can be no assurance that use of e mail as a primary method of communication or commerce over the internet will become widespread  that a market for the company s products and services will emerge or that the interactive messaging platform  fvips or other applications using the virtualpin architecture will be generally adopted 
if the market fails to develop  or develops more slowly than expected  if the internet infrastructure is not adequately expanded or managed  or if the company s products and services do not achieve market acceptance by a significant number of individuals  businesses and financial institutions  then the company s business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
dependence on increased usage and stability of the internet the future of the internet as a center for commerce will depend in significant part on continued rapid growth in the number of households and commercial  educational and government institutions with access to the internet  in the level of usage by individuals and in the number and quality of products and services designed for use on the internet 
in particular  future growth of e mail as a pre eminent method of communication  depends on growing user preference of e mail over traditional means of communication  and on widespread access to reliable and affordable e mail services by individuals  businesses and other organizations 
because usage of the internet as a medium for on line exchange of information  advertising  merchandising and entertainment is a recent phenomenon  it is difficult to predict whether the number of users drawn to the internet will continue to increase and whether any significant market for the interactive messaging platform  virtualtags  financial transactions over the internet  or any substantial commercial use of the internet  will develop 
there can be no assurance that internet usage patterns  and reliance on e mail communication in particular  will continue to grow and will not decline as the novelty of the medium recedes 
in addition  it is uncertain whether the cost of internet access will decline 
failure of the internet or e mail communication to achieve increased acceptance and be accessible to a broad audience at moderate costs would jeopardize the viability of internet commerce and the market for the company s products and services 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that e mail messaging or internet commerce will become widespread or that sustainable markets for the company s products and services will develop 
if such markets fail to develop  develop more slowly than expected or become dominated by one or more competitors  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
furthermore  if the internet becomes unable to support the demands of its users  the internet could lose its viability due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols or due to increased governmental regulation 
if the necessary infrastructure  complementary services or facilities are not developed  or if the internet does not become a viable commercial marketplace  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
competition the market for products and services that enable interactive messaging capabilities and the sale of goods and services over the internet  is intensely competitive  and  to the extent that commercial activity over the internet increases  the company expects competition to increase significantly 
there are no substantial barriers to entry into the company s business  and the company expects established and new entities to enter the market for interactive messaging services  internet payment systems and interactive internet communications in the near future 
it is possible that a single supplier will dominate one or more market segments 
furthermore  since there are many potential entrants to the field  it is extremely difficult to assess which companies are likely to offer competitive products and services in the future  and in some cases it is difficult to discern whether an existing service is competitive with the company s current services 
the company s principal competitors in the interactive messaging services arena include providers of e mail based services such as postx corporation  axicom  replynet  infobeat  inc  email publishing inc  cyber data systems  inc  america online  inc 
and juno online services 
the company also competes with narrative communication in the interactive advertising arena and with broadvision inc  intellipost corporation and e care group  inc 
for one to one marketing  as well as with traditional advertising  merchandising and direct marketing companies that use more conventional means of delivering information and marketing messages to consumers 
the company s principal competitors in the market for secure consumer initiated purchase systems include providers of encrypted credit card transaction systems such as cybercash  inc  bluemoney  open market  inc and verifone  inc 
and providers of electronic cash payment systems such as digicash  inc the company expects that credit card processors and acquiring banks or third party companies will also offer credit card based payment systems if secure electronic transaction set protocols proposed by visa  mastercard  american express  microsoft corporation and netscape are adopted and or accepted as a standard for internet commerce 
set comprises openly published communication and process protocols intended to facilitate encrypted credit card transactions over the web 
further  the company believes that the credit card associations may provide internet merchants with lower transaction fees in order to encourage usage of set 
there can be no assurance that the company s payment system will receive the same treatment  and as such the company may be at a competitive disadvantage 
for example  in july  visa announced its intention to waive its transaction fees  beginning in april for a two year period  for credit card transactions over the internet that use the set protocol 
the company may experience additional competition from internet service providers  advertising and direct marketing agencies and other large established businesses who enter the market for either interactive messaging services and internet payment services 
companies such as america online  microsoft corp  ibm corp  integrion  at t  hewlett packard company  netscape communications corporation  harte hanks data technology  advo  the interpublic group of companies  inc and foote  cone and belding  which possess large  existing customer bases  substantial financial resources and established distribution channels  could develop  market or resell a number of messaging services or payment alternatives 
such potential competitors may also choose to enter the market for messaging services or secure internet payments  by acquiring one of the company s existing competitors or by forming strategic alliances with such competitors  either of which may impede the company s ability to compete effectively 
moreover  fvips competes with public key encryption software provided by rsa data security  inc rsa  a subsidiary of security dynamics technology  inc  the predominant method of reducing the risks associated with transmission of credit card information over the internet 
rsa s encryption technology secure socket layer is incorporated in web server and browser products offered by netscape  microsoft and other vendors  and thus has the largest installed base of any technology for payment security 
in addition  credit card information relating to commercial transactions over the internet is frequently directly transmitted in an unprotected form ie in the clear transactions 
several of the company s current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger installed customer bases  more diversified lines of products and services and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than the company 
such competitors may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to individuals  businesses and financial institutions 
in addition  many of the company s current or potential competitors have broad distribution channels that may be used to bundle competing products or services directly to end users or purchasers 
if such competitors were to bundle competing products or services for their customers  the demand  if any  for the company s products and services might be substantially reduced  and the ability of the company to successfully effect the distribution of its products and the utilization of its services would be substantially diminished 
as a result of the foregoing or other factors  there can be no assurance that the company will compete effectively with current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence upon product and service development  risks of technological change and evolving industry standards the company s success depends upon its ability to develop the interactive messaging platform and other new products and services that satisfy evolving customer requirements including potential applications for internet advertising  merchandising and direct marketing 
the market for the company s services is characterized by rapidly changing technology  emerging industry standards and customer requirements that have been changing every few months 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully identify new product and service opportunities and develop and bring to market new products and services in a timely manner 
failure of the company  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce the interactive messaging platform and other new products and services that are compatible with emerging industry standards and that satisfy customer requirements would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the company or its competitors may announce enhancements to existing products or services  or new products or services embodying new technologies  emerging industry standards or customer requirements that render the company s existing products and services obsolete and unmarketable 
there can be no assurance that the announcement or introduction of new products or services by the company or its competitors or any change in emerging industry standards will not cause customers to terminate use of the company s existing products and services  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s products and services are designed around current technical standards  and the company s current and future revenues are dependent on continued industry acceptance of such standards 
while the company intends to provide compatibility with the standards promulgated by leading industry participants and groups  widespread adoption of a proprietary or closed standard could preclude the company from effectively doing so 
there can be no assurance that the company s products and services will achieve market acceptance  that the company will be successful in developing and introducing new products and services that meet changing customer needs and respond to technological changes or emerging industry standards in a timely manner  if at all  that the standards upon which the company s products and services are or will be based will be accepted by the industry or that products  services or technologies developed by others will not render the company s products and services noncompetitive or obsolete 
the inability of the company to respond to changing market conditions  technological developments  emerging industry standards or changing customer requirements or the development of competing technologies or products that render the company s products and services noncompetitive or obsolete would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks of defects and development delays products and services based on sophisticated software and computing systems often encounter development delays  and the underlying software may contain undetected errors and failures when introduced or when usage increases 
the company may experience delays in the development of the software and computing systems underlying the company s services 
in addition  there can be no assurance that  despite testing by the company and its clients  errors will not be found in the underlying software or that the company will not experience development delays  resulting in delays in the commercial release of its products and services or in the market acceptance of its products and services  each of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risk of capacity constraints a key element of the company s strategy is to generate a high volume of messages and associated transactions through the company s interactive messaging platform and fvips 
accordingly  the performance of the company s products and services is critical to the company s ability to achieve market acceptance and continued use of these products and services 
significant increases in the volume of messages and transactions could strain the capacity of the company s software or hardware  which could lead to slower response time or system failures 
as of this filing  the company has not yet released the interactive messaging platform commercially and has no experience as to the strain that large volumes of messages might have on its systems 
the company has and intends to make substantial investments to increase its server capacity by adding new servers and upgrading its software  when necessary 
as the number of web and internet users increases  there can be no assurance that the company s products and services will be able to meet this demand 
the company and its customers are also dependent upon web browsers  e mail clients and internet and online service providers for access to its services  and users have experienced difficulties due to system failures unrelated to the company s system  products or services 
to the extent that the capacity constraints described above are not effectively addressed by the company  such constraints could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
management of potential growth  risks associated with new management team the rapid development necessary for the company to exploit the market opportunity for the interactive messaging platform  virtualtags  fvips and its other services requires an effective planning and management process 
as of december   the company had five executive officers 
two officers were replaced during the second quarter of the company accepted resignations from both michael schauer  president of financial services  and thomas daniel  vice president of merchant services  and the company hired as officers keith kendrick  vice president of marketing and dr 
carolyn turbyfill  vice president of engineering and operations 
in october  mr 
kendrick was promoted to president 
in january  the company accepted a resignation from philip bane  secretary and general counsel 
also in january  nathaniel borenstein relinquished his officer position  but continues to serve as a scientist to the company 
at the time of this filing  these two officer positions will not be replaced 
in addition  john m 
stachowiak  the company s vice president  finance and administration and chief financial officer  has informed the company that he intends to cease full time employment with the company during the next fiscal quarter 
the company has not designated a successor for mr 
stachowiak 
in february  the company hired david ehrenthal  vice president of marketing and sales 
the company s success depends to a significant extent on the ability of its executive officers and other members of its management to operate effectively  both individually and as a group 
there can be no assurance that the company will satisfactorily allocate responsibilities and that the new executive team will succeed in these roles in a timely and efficient manner 
the company has experienced some difficulty  and most likely in the future  will continue to experience difficulty in integrating or replacing members of management s team from a variety of industry backgrounds 
it is uncertain whether all members of the current management team can be successfully assimilated or replaced 
furthermore  the continued success of the company is largely dependent on the personal efforts and abilities of its senior management and certain other key personnel and on the company s ability to retain current management and to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future 
the company s failure to assimilate executives  or the failure of any of the executives to perform effectively  or the loss of any such executive  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the company believes that its future success will depend upon its continuing ability to identify  attract  train and retain other highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales and marketing and other personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in identifying  attracting  training and retaining the necessary personnel  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the introduction of the interactive messaging platform  the development of the virtualtag software toolkit and the company s efforts to grow the company s customer base and transaction volume  has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on its managerial  operational and financial resources 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively manage the expansion of its operations  that the company s systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support the company s operations or that company s management will be able to achieve the rapid execution necessary to exploit the market opportunity for the company s products and services 
any inability of the company to effectively manage available resources  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on repeated customer use of fvips the future success of fvips and related services is dependent on its ability to expand its base of merchants and consumers and to increase the number of transactions that are conducted using fvips 
the company believes that an increase in the number of fvips transactions depends primarily on the repeated usage of the virtualpin by consumers 
there can be no assurance that the company s historic rate of virtualpin use per consumer will continue or increase  even if the company is successful in increasing the variety and quality of goods and services available over fvips 
in addition  the company anticipates that it may need to modify consumer and merchant registration and renewal fees from time to time in the future and may need to modify its transaction rates charged to merchants 
in late august  the company increased new consumer registration and renewal fees 
at the time of this filing  both the number of new consumer registrations and the number of consumer renewals have declined  as a result of the company implementing its new fee structure 
because the fee change was only implemented in late  there can be no assurance as to the aggregate effect of the fee change on the company s operating results 
any further modification in the fee structure may result in further significant consumer and merchant attrition or reduce future consumer and merchant registrations 
significant consumer or merchant attrition or the failure of the company to substantially increase the number of active users of fvips would materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
certain merchants employing fvips have in the past reduced their use of the system 
although the company has very limited information regarding merchant usage of fvips  the company believes that declining usage of fvips by merchants can occur when merchants cease to maintain their web pages  discontinue product or service offerings on their web sites or find other sufficient payment means  without using fvips  to satisfy their business needs 
such discontinuation could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company also faces the risk of losing merchants that choose to employ alternative payment mechanisms or experience a decline in transactions using fvips 
any significant decline in the usage of fvips by merchants or increase in the rate of merchant attrition could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks of systems failures  lack of insurance and security risks the company s services are dependent on the company s ability to protect its computer equipment and the information stored in its data centers against loss or damage that may be caused by system overloads  fire  power loss  telecommunications failures  unauthorized intrusion  infection by computer viruses and similar events 
the company s data center and servers are currently located in san diego  california  and at a facility in dallas  texas 
there can be no assurance that a system failure at either of these locations would not materially and adversely affect the company s ability to provide its products and services 
the company currently retains highly confidential customer financial information  including bank account and credit card information  in a secure database server that the company believes to be isolated from the internet 
although the server is protected by firewalls and proprietary  one way batch protocols along with regular company reviews of the system for security weaknesses  there can be no assurance that unauthorized individuals could not obtain access to this database server 
any unauthorized penetration of the company s servers which are not directly connected to the internet could result in the theft of bank account and credit card information  e mail addresses  and comprehensive transaction histories 
any unauthorized penetration of the company s servers which are connected to the internet could result in the theft of virtualpin numbers  e mail addresses and recent transaction histories 
unauthorized penetration could lead to attempts to use such information to effect fraudulent purchases  including the introduction of fabricated transactions into the company s financial processors 
although the company believes that the virtualpin architecture should thwart attempts to use misappropriated account information  widespread attempts to effect such transactions would require the company to devote substantial resources to counteracting such attempts and could result in a compromise of the system or the interruption of the company s ability to provide its products and services and may result in adverse publicity to the company and consequently have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
it is also possible that an employee of the company could attempt to divert customer funds or otherwise misuse confidential customer information  exposing the company to legal liability 
in addition  although the company believes that the potential for the unauthorized interception of information transmitted over the internet through fvips is not likely to result in the fraudulent use of virtualpins  there can be no assurance that unauthorized use of such information will not occur and  if it does occur  that it will not result in a financial loss or significant inconvenience to the virtualpin holder 
furthermore  although the company employs disclaimers and limitation of warranty provisions in its customer agreements to attempt to limit its liability to customers  including liability arising out of systems failure or failure of security precautions  there can be no assurance that such provisions will be enforceable  or will otherwise prove effective in limiting the company s exposure to damage claims 
although the company carries property  errors and omissions  crime and business interruption insurance  its coverage may not be adequate to compensate the company for all losses that may occur 
the company is in the process of increasing its server capacity  improving its security mechanisms and taking other precautions to protect itself and its customers from events that could interrupt delivery of the company s products and services or result in a loss of transaction or customer data 
however  these measures will not eliminate a significant risk to the company s operations from a natural disaster or systems failure 
there can be no assurance that these measures would protect the company from an organized effort to inundate the company s servers with massive quantities of e mail or other internet message traffic which could overload the company s systems and result in a significant interruption of service 
in august  the company experienced a hour disruption in its systems which resulted in interruption of service to all merchants and consumers for such period 
in addition  in july  the company experienced a situation that required unscheduled database maintenance to be performed 
as a result  transactions were held in a queue for hours until the database maintenance was complete 
any systems failure that causes a significant interruption to or increases response time of the company s products and services could reduce use of the company s products and services and would reduce the attractiveness of the company s products and services to current and future customers 
the company s business interruption insurance would not fully compensate the company for lost revenues  income  additional costs or increased costs experienced by the company during the occurrence of any disruption of its computer systems  nor is there any assurance that the company will be able to obtain such coverage on reasonable terms or at all in the future 
significant service interruptions could also damage the company s reputation and result in the loss of a significant portion of its merchants and consumers  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
limited intellectual property the company relies on a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure agreements  and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect its proprietary rights 
the company believes that  due to the rapid pace of technological innovation for internet products  the company s ability to establish and maintain a position of technology leadership in the industry depends more on the skills of its development personnel than upon the legal protections afforded its existing technology 
there can be no assurance that trade secret  copyright and trademark protections will be adequate to safeguard the proprietary software underlying the company s products and services  or that its agreements with employees  consultants and others who participate in the development of its software will not be breached  that the company will have adequate remedies for any breach or that the company s trade secrets will not otherwise become known 
moreover  notwithstanding the company s efforts to protect its intellectual property  there is no assurance that competitors will not be able to develop functionally equivalent interactive messaging technologies or internet payment services without infringing any of the company s intellectual property rights 
despite the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use products or technology that the company considers proprietary  and third parties may attempt to develop similar technology independently 
in addition  effective protection of intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in certain countries 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company s means of protecting its proprietary rights will be adequate or that the company s competitors will not independently develop similar technology 
as the volume of internet commerce increases  and the number of products and service providers that support internet commerce increases  the company believes that internet commerce technology providers may become increasingly subject to infringement claims 
there can be no assurance that infringement claims will not be filed by plaintiffs in the future 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  disrupt or delay the enhancement or shipment of the company s products and services or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable or favorable to the company  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the company may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of the company s proprietary rights or to establish the validity of the company s proprietary rights 
litigation to determine the validity of any claims could result in significant expense to the company and divert the efforts of the company s technical and management personnel from productive tasks  whether or not such litigation is determined in favor of the company 
in the event of an adverse ruling in any such litigation  the company may be required to pay substantial damages  discontinue the use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or obtain licenses to infringing technology 
the failure of the company to develop or license a substitute technology could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
government regulation and legal uncertainties the company believes it is not currently subject to direct regulation by any government agency in the us  other than regulations generally applicable to businesses  and there are currently few laws or regulations directly applicable to access to  or commerce on  the internet 
however  no assurance can be given that federal  state or foreign agencies will not attempt in the near future to begin to regulate the market for internet commerce 
in addition  if a government agency were to challenge the company s position with respect to the applicability of regulations to its activities  responding to such a challenge could result in significant expenditures of the company s financial and management resources  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
more generally  due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet  it is possible that a number of laws and regulations will be adopted with respect to the internet  covering issues such as user privacy  pricing  taxation and characteristics and quality of products and services 
for example  the telecommunications reform act of may subject certain internet content providers to criminal penalties for the transmission of certain information  and could also result in liability to internet service providers  web hosting sites and transaction facilitators such as the company 
various foreign jurisdictions have also moved to regulate access to the internet and to strictly control web content 
even if the company s business is not directly subject to regulation  the adoption of any such laws or regulations may inhibit the growth of the internet  or the businesses of the users of the company s products and services  which could in turn adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  the applicability to the internet of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  libel  taxation and personal privacy is uncertain 
such uncertainty creates the risk that such laws could be interpreted in a manner that could generally inhibit commerce on the internet and adversely impact the company s business 
due to the growth of internet commerce  congress has considered regulating providers of services and transactions in this market  and federal or state authorities could enact laws  rules or regulations affecting the company s business or operations 
senior officials from several regulatory agencies  including the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve board and the office of the comptroller of the currency  have indicated that those agencies have refrained from promulgating regulations in order to encourage continued development of electronic commerce  but will monitor this area closely in the future 
for example  the electronic fund transfer act and regulation e  promulgated by the federal reserve board  govern certain electronic funds transfers made by regulated financial institutions from a consumer s account  and govern providers of access devices and electronic funds transfer services 
although the company believes that its current services are not subject to regulation e  there is no assurance that the federal reserve board will not require all or certain of the company s services to comply with regulation e  revise regulation e or adopt new rules and regulations affecting electronic commercial transactions 
other government agencies in addition to the federal reserve board  including the federal trade commission and the federal communications commission  may promulgate rules and regulations affecting the company s activities or those of the users of its products and services 
any or all of these potential actions could result in increased operating costs for the company or for the principal users of its services and could also reduce the convenience and functionality of the company s services  possibly resulting in reduced market acceptance which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
evolving financial industry policies for internet commerce the company currently relies on credit cards as the payment method for fvips transactions 
credit card associations are still in the process of drafting operating regulations governing many credit card transactions on the internet 
in some cases  the company s access to the payment systems of credit card associations and other payment providers may be conditioned on its compliance  and the compliance of associated processors such as paymentech inc  with interim regulations 
the company s operations have been reviewed by mastercard and visa which currently are the sole payment methods accepted by the company 
visa has issued to paymentech inc  several conditions which govern paymentech inc 
s processing of transactions for the company over the visa system 
these conditions  among other things  establish a maximum dollar amount and aging of small dollar transactions that the company can accumulate before they are submitted to the visa system for processing  and establish procedures for handling chargebacks involving such bundled transactions 
the company does not believe that these conditions materially burden the company s current operations 
the conditions were initially issued pursuant to an oral communication and were due to expire on december  the conditions were renewed until the later of the adoption of industry wide operating regulations addressing internet transactions or december  at december   the internet transaction operating regulations had not been adopted  thus  the conditions were renewed until december   with visa s concurrence 
to date  mastercard has not issued any conditions that are specific to the company s operations 
while the company hopes that it will be able to comply with visa s future operating regulations and regulations issued by any other credit card association  there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so or that compliance will not have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance  if the operating regulations have not been adopted  that the conditions agreement between paymentech inc and visa  or related agreements between paymentech inc and the company and other payment providers  will be issued or extended  if at all  on terms that do not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risk of loss from returned transactions  merchant fraud or erroneous transactions because the company acts as an intermediary and facilitator for credit card transactions  the company may be subject to the risks borne by merchants generally in the use of credit card payment systems  primarily the risk that the consumer s payment will be charged back because of unauthorized use of the consumer s credit card  disputes over the goods or services purchased by the consumer  erroneous transmission of information by the company  or fraud by the merchant or consumer 
the company s customer agreements provide for the allocation of the risk of chargebacks other than chargebacks caused by erroneous transmission by the company to merchants  but such agreements may not be enforceable 
in addition  even if the company has an enforceable right to charge a merchant s account for the amount of a chargeback  the company is subject to the risk that the merchant may not have a sufficient positive balance of net proceeds from other fvips transactions to cover the chargeback and may otherwise be unable or unwilling to pay 
the company manages these risks through its risk management systems and internal controls the company currently requires explicit authorization by consumers prior to initiating a charge of the consumer s credit card  holds funds for days for merchants who do not qualify for accelerated settlement terms and subjects merchants who attempt to so qualify to a screening process  and holds qualified merchants funds for three to five business days 
as a result  the company believes that the risks associated with widespread chargebacks by customers are minimized  but there can be no assurance that chargebacks will not increase significantly in the future as the volume of fvips transactions increases and as more merchants of goods and services requiring physical delivery begin to use fvips 
there also can be no assurance that the company will not change fvips in a manner that increases the risk of exposure to chargebacks  or that the company s reserves will be sufficient to protect the company from increased chargebacks 
a significant increase in chargebacks could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risk of changes in consumer perceptions the company s future is in part dependent on the development of demand for products and services that support transactions processed by fvips over the internet and  in particular  use credit card based payment mechanisms 
demand for secure payment solutions  including fvips  has been fueled in part by wide spread fears of the risks associated with the potential theft of credit card account numbers transmitted over the internet and other manifestations of internet based credit card fraud 
such consumer perceptions of the risks associated with credit card based internet transactions have received substantial media attention  but may lack empirical support 
in addition  the company believes that most consumers may be unaware that the potential liability resulting from fraudulent charges to their credit card accounts is limited by federal laws that limit the liability of cardholders for unauthorized use of their card to no more than any change in consumer perception of the incidence of credit card account number theft over the internet  or the potential liability attendant to such fraud  could impact the demand for internet security mechanisms  including fvips 
any such decline in the perceived need for the security which the company believes to be a principal feature of fvips could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
integration of potential acquisitions as a part of its business strategy  the company may make acquisitions of  or significant investments in  complementary companies  products or technologies 
any such future acquisitions would be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of companies 
such risks include  among other things  the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  the potential disruption of the company s ongoing business  the inability of management to maximize the financial and strategic position of the company through the successful incorporation of acquired technology and rights into the company s products and services  additional expense associated with amortization of acquired intangible assets  the maintenance of uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies and the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company would be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with such acquisitions
