item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the company distributes a wide variety of transistors  diodes and other semiconductors and optoelectronic devices to other electronic distributors  contract electronic manufacturers cems and original equipment manufacturers oems who incorporate them in their products 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain operating amounts and ratios years ended december  dollars in thousands net sales    cost of goods sold    of net sales gross profit    of net sales selling  general and administrative expenses    of net sales operating earnings    of net sales income tax expense    effective tax rate as a of earnings before income taxes net earnings    of net sales year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  increased  or to  from  from the year ended december  the increase in net sales during was attributable principally to an increase in the volume of products sold of million  partially offset by net price reductions of approximately million 
the company also experienced an increase in export sales volume of approximately million and a  reduction in sales returns and allowances from customers 
the increase in net sales was principally a result of sales made to new customers during cost of goods sold increased by  to  for the year ended december   an increase of from the year ended december  early in  the demand for discrete semiconductors was greater than the supply 
the intense competition for available supply of discrete semiconductors caused the company to purchase products for prices that were higher than normal market conditions 
as the high priced inventory was sold in late and all of  it caused cost of goods sold to increase as a percentage of sales 
gross profit on net sales increased by  to  for the year ended december  from  from the year ended december   and decreased  as a percentage of net sales  to from 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  principally as a result of lower selling prices due to the competitive market place and as a result of higher export sales which usually have a lower profit margin than domestic sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  or in as compared to the increase was attributable to increased payroll costs principally as a result of the geographic expansion of its direct sales force and the addition of sales support staff 
the increase in net sales resulted in an increase in commissions paid to both sales employees and independent sales representatives 
in addition  management decided to take a one time impairment charge in connection with the abandonment of the company s prior computer software system in the amount of  selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net sales  increased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december operating earnings decreased by  or between the years ended december  and  and decreased as a percentage of net sales to from 
operating earnings decreased principally as a result of increased cost of sales and increases in selling  general and administrative expenses as described above 
interest expense  net for the year ended december  increased  compared to the year ended december  net interest expense as a percentage of net sales  decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  during  interest expense resulted from borrowings incurred to finance increased inventory levels  trade receivables  computer software  office space and equipment in the taiwan office and to finance the repurchase of  shares of the company s class a common stock 
income taxes were  for the year ended december   resulting in an effective tax rate of  compared to  for the year ended december   an effective tax rate of 
the company had net earnings of  for the year ended december  as compared with net earnings of  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or for the reasons discussed above 
net earnings as a percentage of net sales decreased to from 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  were  compared with net sales for the year ended december  of  a decrease of  or 
this decrease in net sales during was attributable principally to a decline in the company s domestic sales volume of approximately  net price reductions accounted for approximately  of the net sales decrease and had a negative impact on gross profit 
for most of  the demand for discrete semiconductors was greater than the supply 
the intense competition for the available supply of discrete semiconductors allowed the company to sell its products for prices that were higher than normal market conditions 
a decrease in export sales of  also contributed to the decline in net sales 
the company has continued to add new customers during  but at a slower rate than during the decline in net sales was principally a result of an industry wide decline in demand for discrete semiconductors 
cost of goods sold decreased by  to  for the year ended december   a decrease of from the year ended december  consistent with the decrease in net sales  the company was able to reduce the cost of goods sold  although at a lesser rate than the decrease in sales due to the cost incurred in earlier periods to acquire the products sold during gross profit on net sales decreased by  to  for the year ended december  from  for the same period in  and decreased as a percentage of net sales to from 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by  or for compared to these expenses  as a percentage of net sales  increased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the company was able to reduce selling  general and administrative expenses during  principally by eliminating non essential expenditures and not replacing employees who left the company 
operating earnings decreased by  or between the years ended december   and  and decreased as a percentage of net sales to from 
operating earnings decreased principally as a result of decreases in both domestic and export sales and market price reductions 
the decrease in revenue was offset somewhat by a reduction in cost of goods sold and selling  general and administrative expenses 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased  compared to the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to increased borrowings made to finance the increase in inventory during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  income taxes were  for the year ended december   representing an effective tax rate of  compared to  for the year ended december   an effective tax rate of 
the company had net earnings of  for the year ended december  as compared with net earnings of  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or for the reasons discussed above 
net earnings as a percentage of net sales decreased to from 
supply and demand issues the year was exceptionally good for the company and other discrete suppliers 
for most of  the demand for discrete semiconductors  in general  was greater than the supply 
the intense competition for the available supply of discrete semiconductors pushed the prices higher than in normal market conditions 
the company  from time to time  could not fulfill some sales orders because of the limited supply of certain of these products 
the supply shortage of discrete semiconductors in caused many customers to order more than their needs to prevent future shortages and suppliers expanded their capacity to meet the strong market demands 
however  with a weak market demand in the later part of  many distributors and end users had built up excessive inventories and as a result  the majority of taitron s customers were struggling with inventory adjustments and corrections 
to help customers readjust their inventories  taitron strategically decided to accept more returns and order cancellations than it normally would 
in  suppliers increased capacity and the weak demand left suppliers with large amounts of uncommitted products 
during and continuing into  the company decided to take advantage of this situation by intensifying its long standing purchasing strategy by making opportunistic purchases of suppliers uncommitted capacity  at favorable pricing 
the company believes this strategy of opportunistic purchasing will posture the company to be price competitive  while still maintaining acceptable profit margins 
as a result  the company s inventory has increased significantly during and continuing into  leading to the leasing of additional warehouse space in and full utilization of the space in the company s inventory level peaked in may at million and has subsequently reduced to million at december  the company is focusing its efforts to maintain or gradually reduce its inventory while maintaining adequate stock to accommodate the company s future growth  if any  when demand increases 
in order to finance these strategic purchases  the revolving debt increased to million in june and has subsequently been reduced to million at december  taitron s competitive edge is its ability to fill customer orders immediately from stock held in inventory 
thus  management has structured inventory levels in such a way as to poise the company to take advantage of a recovery in the discrete semiconductor market 
at the same time  if the market recovery is slow in taking place  inventory levels should not impose an unwarranted financial burden on the company s earnings 
management believes  that the strategies it has followed with its customers and suppliers have cemented its relationships which will benefit the company in the future 
the company s core strategy has been to maintain a substantial inventory of discrete semiconductors purchased at prices generally lower than those commonly available to its competitors 
the company has been able to offer its products to customers at competitive prices and offers other incentives to customers  such as its no hassle returns policy  which distinguishes the company from most of its competitors 
several of the matters discussed under supply and demand issues contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties with respect to growth and relationships with suppliers 
many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements 
see business cautionary statements and risk factors relationship with suppliers 
liquidity and capital resources since  the company has satisfied its liquidity requirements principally through cash generated from short term commercial loans and the sale of equity securities  including the initial public offering of its common stock in april the company s cash flows provided by used in operating  financing and investing activities for the years ended december   and were as follows year ended december  in thousands operating activities   investing activities financing activities    in positioning itself as a discrete components superstore  the company has been required to significantly increase its inventory levels 
as a consequence  inventory has grown from million at december  to million at december  the discrete semiconductor products distributed by the company are mature products  used in a wide range of commercial and industrial products and industries 
as a result  the company has never experienced any material amounts of product obsolescence 
the company also attempts to control its inventory risks by matching large customer orders with simultaneous orders to suppliers 
nonetheless  the high levels of inventory carried by the company increase the risks of price fluctuations and product obsolescence 
investment activities consisted of the purchase of property and equipment  principally computer equipment 
investment in computer equipment was   and  for the years ended december   and during  the company invested  in its taiwan office  principally for acquisition of office and warehouse space 
the company expects to invest an additional amount of approximately  per year over the next several years in hardware and software for maintaining and improving its new oracle applications system  which is scheduled to be operational in the second quarter of see business management information systems 
on april   the company completed its initial public offering of  shares of its class a common stock 
the net proceeds of approximately million were used during to retire bank debt in the amount of million  to repay  in long term mortgage debt  to expand inventory and for general corporate purposes 
in may  the company issued a convertible subordinated note the note for  with interest at payable annually and the principal is due may the note is convertible into the company s class a common stock at the conversion price of per share 
these securities have not been registered under the securities act of  as amended the act  and the company issued these securities in reliance upon exemption from registration provided by regulation s of the act 
in may  the company replaced its million revolving line of credit that had been in place since march the new revolving line of credit provides the company with up to million for operating purposes and up to an additional million for business acquisition purposes 
both facilities mature on june  the agreement governing these credit facilities contains covenants that require the company to be in compliance with certain financial ratios 
the company believes that funds generated from operations and the revolving line of credit will be sufficient to finance its working capital and capital expenditures requirements for the foreseeable future 
year issues the company has conducted a comprehensive review of its computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the year issue and is developing an implementation plan to resolve the issue 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather the this could result in a major system failure or miscalculations 
the company presently believes that  with modifications to existing software and converting to an oracle applications system which is year compliant  the year problem will not pose significant operational problems for the company s computer systems as so modified and converted 
asian economic issues many of the company s suppliers have their manufacturing facilities in countries who s economies are experiencing financial problems 
mounting trade deficits have sent interest rates soaring and local currencies plunging 
the us dollar s rise compared with asian currencies may reduce exports to asia in the future 
during  the company sold million or of net sales to asian customers and most of the products purchased by the company are manufactured in asia 
management believes that the decline in asian currencies may actually benefit the company in the short term by providing an opportunity for the company to purchase products at lower prices
