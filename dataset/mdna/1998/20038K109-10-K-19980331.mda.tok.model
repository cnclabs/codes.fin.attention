item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion set forth below supplements the information found in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the matters discussed below and elsewhere in this report contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  many of which may be beyond the company s control 
see forward looking statements in item of this report for a discussion of certain of such risks and uncertainties 
overview set forth below are discussions and analyses of financial condition and results of operations of the company 
the company believes that its future operating results may not be directly comparable to historical operating because of the company s increased size  related cost savings and marketing synergies 
from october through december   the company had completed eight acquisitions 
see acquisitions in item of this report 
each of these acquisitions has been accounted for on a purchase basis and the results of operations of each of the businesses acquired have been included in the company s historical financial statements from the date of acquisition 
certain of these acquisitions provide for contingent payments by the company as a part of the purchase consideration based upon the operating results of the acquired businesses for specified future periods 
the acquisitions were financed by the company principally through its issuance of debt and equity securities and borrowings under bank credit facilities 
as a result  the company s historical results of operations include bridge financing costs which are not expected to be incurred in future periods and preferred stock dividends 
in addition  as a result of its rapid growth through acquisitions  the discussion and comparison of the company s historical results of operations set forth below may not be meaningful 
gross margins on staffing services can vary significantly depending on factors such as the specific services being performed  the overall contract size and the amount of recruiting required 
margins on the company s sales in the technical services sector are typically significantly lower than those in the telecommunications and information technology sectors 
additionally  in certain markets the company has experienced pricing pressure from some of its competitors 
consequently  changes in the company s sales mix can be expected to impact the overall gross margins generated by the company 
staffing personnel placed by the company are employees of the company 
the company is responsible for employee related expenses for its employees  including workers compensation  unemployment compensation insurance  medicare and social security taxes and general payroll expenses 
the company offers health  dental  disability and life insurance to its billable employees 
staffing and consulting companies  including the company  typically pay their billable employees weekly for their services before receiving payment from their customers  often resulting in significant outstanding receivables 
to the extent the company increases revenues through acquisitions and or internal growth  these receivables will grow and there will be greater requirements for borrowing availability under its credit facilities to fund current operations

the scheduled maturity date of the new credit facility is november  results of operations historical financial information for the company for and prior years relates principally to operations discontinued by the company effective september  only limited results of the company s contingent staffing operations following the company s acquisition of comforce telecom in october are reflected in see business discontinued operations in item of this report 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues of million for the year ended december  were million  or approximately higher than revenues for the year ended december  the increase in revenues is attributable principally to the company s completion of six acquisitions since the end of the first quarter of cost of revenues for the year ended december  was of revenues compared to cost of revenues of for the year ended december  the cost of revenues increase of is a result of the company s business mix in  which reflected the full year impact of acquisitions completed during as well as expansion in into more mature technical staffing sectors 
these more mature technical staffing sectors historically generate gross margins substantially lower than telecommunications and information technology sectors  principally due to the nature of the related contracts and competition in this sector 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the decrease is principally attributable to the acquisitions completed during and which contributed increased revenues with lower incremental selling  general and administrative costs 
during  the company recorded merger  integration and other non recurring charges totaling million 
these non recurring charges before taxes consist of merger and integration charges resulting from the acquisition of uniforce  and include severance costs of  asset write downs of  and integration costs of  operating income for the year ended december  was million  compared to operating income of million for the year ended december  this increase was principally attributable to the company s completion of six acquisitions following the end of the first quarter of and prior to december  bridge and financing charges for the year ended december  are attributable principally to the amortization of bridge finance costs payable on the million principal amount of the subordinated convertible debentures the old subordinated debentures issued by the company in february and march  the proceeds of which were used to partially fund the acquisition of rhotech and for working capital purposes  and the write off of deferred financing fees on the fleet credit facility  which was repaid in november the company s interest expense for the year ended december  is attributable to the interest on the company s credit facilities outstanding during the year and the notes and senior debentures issued in november income tax reflects a credit for the year ended december  for million on a loss before income taxes of million  compared to a tax provision of  on pretax income of million for the year ended december  such credit assumes that the company will have taxable income in future periods 
the difference between the federal statutory income tax rate and the company s effective tax rate relates primarily to state income taxes and the nondeductibility of certain intangible assets 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues of million for the year ended december  were million higher than revenues for the year ended december  approximately of this increase in revenues is attributable to full year operations for comforce telecom in  and approximately is attributable to the acquisition of five additional staffing business by the company during cost of revenues for the year ended december  was of revenues compared to cost of revenues of for the year ended december  the cost of revenues increase of is a result of the company s expansion into more mature technical staffing sectors  which historically generate gross margins substantially lower than telecommunications and it sectors  principally due to the nature of the related contracts and competition in this sector 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million from the selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  the increase in selling  general and administrative expense is principally due to the company s limited operations in the stock compensation charge incurred by the company in of million relates to stock awarded to certain individuals to direct the company s entry into the technical staffing business 
historical operating income for the year ended december  was million compared to an operating loss of million for the year ended december  the improvement of million was principally attributable to the discontinuance in the period of the non recurring stock compensation charge of million recorded in the operating income was also impacted by the acquisitions completed during the year and increased margins on revenue growth in the company s telecommunications and information technology sectors 
the income tax provision for the year ended december  was  on pretax income of million compared with an income tax provision of  on a loss before income taxes and extraordinary credit of million for the year ended december  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources the company has historically paid its billable employees weekly for their services before receiving payment from its customers 
additionally  certain statutory payroll and related taxes  as well as other fringe benefits  are generally paid by the company before the company receives payment from its customers 
consequently  a significant portion of the company s cost of revenues is normally paid by the company prior to receiving payment from its customers 
increases in the company s revenues  resulting from expansion of existing offices or establishment of new offices  will require additional cash resources necessary to support such growth 
the debt service costs associated with the borrowings under the notes  the senior debentures and the new credit facility will significantly increase liquidity requirements 
management of the company believes that  based on pro forma results of operations and anticipated growth  including growth through acquisitions  cash flow from operations and funds anticipated to be available under the new credit facility will be sufficient to service the company s indebtedness  to fund growth at anticipated levels and to meet anticipated working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  various factors  including those described under forward looking statements in item of this report  could prevent the company from realizing these objectives 
as of december   the company had outstanding million in principal amount of senior debentures bearing interest at a rate of  million in principal amount of notes issued by coi bearing interest at a rate of  million outstanding under the new credit facility bearing interest at a rate of and million outstanding under the new credit facility bearing interest at a rate of 
as of december   approximately million  or of the company s total assets were intangible assets 
these intangible assets substantially represent amounts attributable to goodwill recorded in connection with the company s acquisitions and will be amortized over a five to year period  resulting in an annual charge of approximately million 
various factors could impact the company s ability to generate the earnings necessary to support this amortization schedule  including those described under forward looking statements in item of this report 
the company is obligated under various acquisition agreements to make earn out payments to the sellers of acquired companies  subject to the acquired companies meeting certain contractual requirements 
for  sellers became entitled to receive earn out payments of million payable in cash and  shares of the company s common stock  of which  in cash has been paid and all such shares of stock issued 
the maximum amount of the remaining potential earn out payments is million in cash and million in stock payable in the three year period from to the company cannot currently estimate whether it will be obligated to pay the maximum amount  however  the company anticipates that the cash generated by the operations of the acquired companies will provide all or a substantial part of the capital required to fund the cash portion of the earn out payments 
during  the company s primary sources of funds to meet working capital needs were i cash from operations  ii net proceeds from the company s million offering of its old subordinated debentures in february and march  which was repaid in june principally from the proceeds of the fleet credit facility  iii the company s borrowings under a short term credit facility with us bank  washington  entered into in february  which provided for borrowing availability of up to million the u 
s 
bank credit facility  the outstanding balance of which was repaid in june  principally from the proceeds of the fleet credit facility  iv the company s borrowings under the fleet credit facility entered into in june  which provided for borrowing availability of up to million  the outstanding balance of which was repaid in november principally from the proceeds of the new credit facility  v the proceeds of the offering by the company and coi of million original principal amount of the notes and senior debentures in november see recent transactions the notes and the senior debentures and warrants in this item  and vi the company s borrowings under the new credit facility  which provides for borrowing availability of up to million based on a specified percentage of the company s eligible accounts receivable see recent transactions the new credit facility in this item 
cash and cash equivalents increased million during the year ended december  cash flows provided by financing activities of million were in excess of cash flows used in operating activities of million  and cash flows used in investing activities of million 
cash flows used by operating activities were principally attributable to the need to fund growth in accounts receivable and their carrying costs 
cash flows used in investing activities are principally related to the purchase of uniforce and rhotech 
cash flows from financing activities were principally attributable to net proceeds available to the company in connection with its sale of the old subordinated debentures which were redeemed in june  net borrowings under the u 
s 
bank credit facility which was repaid in june  net borrowings under the fleet credit facility which was repaid in november  and net borrowings under the new credit facility and proceeds from the sale of the notes and senior debentures  as described above 
seasonality the company s quarterly operating results are affected primarily by the number of billing days in the quarter and the seasonality of its customers businesses 
demand for services in the technical services sector has historically been lower during the year end holidays through january of the following year  showing gradual improvement over the remainder of the year 
although less pronounced than in technical services  the demand for services of the telecommunications and it sectors is typically lower during the first quarter until customers operating budgets are finalized 
the company believes that the effects of seasonality will be less severe in the future if revenues contributed by the information technology and telecommunications sectors continue to increase as a percentage of the company s consolidated revenues 
other matters in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 reporting comprehensive income sfas  which requires that changes in comprehensive income be shown in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements 
sfas no

in june  the financial accounting standards board issued financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas  which changes the way public companies report information about segments 
sfas  which is based on the management approach to segment reporting  includes requirements to report selected segment information quarterly and entity wide disclosures about products and services  major customers  and the material countries in which the entity holds and reports revenues 
sfas becomes effective in fiscal management has not evaluated the effect of this change on the company s financial statements 
the company does not anticipate that its systems will be negatively impacted by year requirements
