a separate internal credit examination department periodically conducts examinations of the quality  documentation and administration of the company s lending departments  and submits reports thereon to a committee of the board of directors 
emphasis is placed on early detection of potential problem credits so that action plans can be developed on a timely basis to mitigate losses 
another aspect of the company s credit risk management strategy is the diversification of the loan portfolio 
at year end  the company had of its portfolio in loans held for sale  in commercial loans  in real estate loans  in consumer loans  in lease financing and in other loans 
the company s real estate portfolio is also diversified 
of the total portfolio  is in real estate construction loans  is in home equity credit lines  is in family residential loans and is in commercial loans secured by real estate

loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when the loan is days or more past due as to principal or interest  unless the loan is in the process of collection and well secured 
consumer loans are not placed on a nonaccrual status  inasmuch as they are generally charged off when they become days past due 
loans are restructured to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal payments when the financial condition of the borrower deteriorates and requires that the borrower be given temporary or permanent relief from the original contractual terms of the credit 
other real estate owned is primarily acquired through or in lieu of foreclosure on credits secured by real estate 
the company s nonperforming assets were million on december   up from million on december  such nonperforming assets as a percentage of net loans and leases  other real estate owned and other nonperforming assets were 
on december   as compared to 
on december  accruing loans past due days or more totaled million on december   up from million on december  these loans equaled 
of net loans and leases on december   as compared to 
on december  no loans were considered potential problem loans on december  or potential problem loans are defined as loans presently on accrual and not contractually past due days or more and not restructured  but about which management has serious doubt as to the future ability of the borrower to comply with present repayment terms and which may result in the reporting of the loans as nonperforming assets 
the company s total recorded investment in impaired loans  in accordance with financial accounting standard statements and included in nonaccrual loans and leases  amounted to million and million on december  and  respectively 
the company considers a loan to be impaired when the accrual of interest has been discontinued and meets other criteria under the statements 
the amount of the impairment is measured based on the present value of expected cash flows  the observable market price of the loan  or the fair value of the collateral 
impairment losses are included in the allowance for loan losses through a provision for loan losses 
included in the allowance for loan losses on december  and  is a required allowance of thousand and thousand respectively  on 
million and million  respectively  of the recorded investment in impaired loans

commitments to extend credit on loans and standby letters of credit on december   and  totaled  million   million  and  million  respectively 
the company s actual future credit exposure is much lower than the contractual amounts of the commitments because a significant portion of the commitments is expected to expire without being drawn upon 
in analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses  management utilizes a comprehensive loan grading system to determine risk potential in the portfolio  and considers the results of independent internal and external credit review  historical charge off experience  and changes in the composition and volume of the portfolio 
other factors  such as general economic conditions and collateral values  are also considered 
larger problem credits are individually evaluated to determine appropriate reserve allocations 
additions to the allowance are based upon the resulting risk profile of the portfolio developed through the evaluation of the above factors 
summary of loan loss experience the following table shows the change in the allowance for losses for each year indicated

ratio of allowance for possible losses to loans and leases outstanding on december ratio of allowance for possible losses to nonperforming loans on december ratio of allowance for possible losses to nonaccrual loans and accruing loans past due days or more on december includes loans held for sale review of nonperforming loans and evaluation of the quality of the loan portfolio  as previously mentioned  results in the identification of certain loans with risk characteristics which warrant specific reserve allocations in the determination of the amount of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance is not allocated among all loan categories  and amounts allocated to specific categories are not necessarily indicative of future charge offs 
an amount in the allowance not specifically allocated by loan category is necessary in view of the fact that  while no loans were made with the expectation of loss  some loan losses inevitably occur

liquidity is primarily provided by the regularly scheduled maturities of the company s investment and loan portfolios 
management of the maturities of these portfolios is an important source of medium to long term liquidity 
the company s ability to raise funds in the capital markets through the securitization process allows it to meet funding needs at a reasonable cost 
to meet the company s short term liquidity needs  on december  the company had cash  money market investments  and liquid securities net of short term or purchased liabilities and foreign deposits  of billion or of core deposits 
the company s core deposits  consisting of demand  savings  money market  and time deposits under  constituted of total deposits at year end 
the parent company s cash requirements consist primarily of debt service  dividends to shareholders  operating expenses  income taxes and share repurchases 
the parent s cash needs are routinely met through dividends from subsidiaries  proportionate shares of current income taxes  management and other fees  unaffiliated bank lines and debt issuance 
at january   million of dividend capacity was available from subsidiaries to pay to the parent without having to obtain regulatory approval 
during  dividends from subsidiaries were million 
in october  the parent issued a million senior note to a third party in a private transaction 
the note matures in october at december  the parent had revolving credit facilities with two banks totaling million 
on that date  the balance outstanding on these bank lines was million 
market risk management market risk is the possibility that changes in interest rates or equity securities prices will impair the fair value of the company s financial instruments 
the asset liability committee alcom measures and reviews the market risk of the company and establishes policies and procedures to limit its exposure to changes in interest rates 
these policies are reviewed and approved by the boards of directors of the company s subsidiary banks 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk regularly undertaken by the company 
this risk is monitored through the use of three complementary measurement methods equity duration  income simulation  and gap analysis 
equity duration is the residual average life of the company s equity determined by subtracting the weighted average life of the discounted expected cash flows of its liabilities from its assets 
income simulation is an estimate of the net interest income which would be recognized under different rate environments 
gap analysis compares the amount of assets which mature or are subject to an interest rate reset during a specified period to the amount of liabilities with similar rate change characteristics 
at year end  the equity duration of the company was estimated to be years 
a basis point immediate increase in rates was estimated to increase the duration of equity to years 
conversely  an immediate decrease in rates of similar magnitude was estimated to decrease the duration of equity to years 
company policy requires that all three of these measures be between and years 
for income simulation  company policy requires that net interest income not be expected to decline by more than during one year if rates rise or fall by basis points during the period 
at year end  net interest income was expected to decline by during in a rising rate environment relative to projected net interest income in a stable rate environment 
if rates declined by basis points during  net interest income was forecasted to be lower than if rates are stable 
net interest income was expected to be modestly lower in either a rising or declining rate scenario for a variety of factors  including management s assumptions regarding loan and deposit pricing  security and loan prepayments  and changes in relationships between market rates 
management exercises its best judgment in making assumptions regarding loan and security prepayments  early deposit withdrawals  and other non controllable events in managing the company s exposure to changes in interest rates 
the interest rate risk position is actively managed and changes daily as the interest rate environment changes  therefore  positions at the end of any period may not be reflective of the company s position in any subsequent period 
at year end  the one year gap for the company was negative million  ie  the  million of assets that mature or reprice during was estimated to be less than the  million of liabilities and the million net effect of off balance sheet swaps that mature or reprice during the same period 
this gap represented of total assets 
details of the repricing characteristics of the balance sheet as of year end are presented in the accompanying table

the prime lending rate is the primary basis used for pricing the company s loans and the day treasury bill rate is the index used for pricing many of the company s deposits 
the company  however  is unable to economically hedge the prime t bill spread risk through the use of derivative financial instruments

the company is in the process of modifying or replacing certain computer software and hardware and other systems to ensure proper processing of transactions after the company is also in contact with external service providers to ascertain that their systems  upon which the company depends  will also be upgraded  if necessary 
the company anticipates that all of its major systems for which it conducts its own processing will be compliant with year processing by the end of it expects to test each of its systems to confirm compliance late this year 
the company believes that all of its third party service providers will also be compliant by the end of this year  except for its trust and mortgage processing systems  which it believes will be able to appropriately handle transactions after by the end of the first quarter of next year 
a review is also being undertaken of the company s other systems to confirm proper functionality after  including security cameras  alarm systems  voice mail  and elevators  among others 
finally  the company inquires about year preparedness being undertaken by its customers to which it has significant credit exposure 
the company estimates that the cumulative incremental cost it will incur to address the year issue to be approximately million 
the cost estimate excludes the expense outlays the company is making to replace its processing systems in the ordinary course of business to improve its products and services 
many of these new systems also correct deficiencies that the company s present software has in processing transactions after the preponderance of this expense will be recognized in forward looking statements statements in management s discussion and analysis that are not based on historical data may constitute forward looking information within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of actual results may differ materially from the projections discussed in management s discussion and analysis since such projections involve significant risks and uncertainties 
factors that might cause such differences include  but are not limited to timing of closing proposed acquisitions being delayed or such acquisitions being prohibited  competitive pressures among financial institutions increasing significantly  economic conditions  either nationally or locally in areas in which zions conducts its operations  being less favorable than expected  legislation or regulatory changes which adversely affect the ability of the company to conduct  or the accounting for  business combinations
