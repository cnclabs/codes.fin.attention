the following table sets forth certain operating data for the three years ended december   and year ended december operating income    add time brokerage agreement fees   depreciation and amortization    corporate expense    non cash compensation    broadcast cash flow    broadcast cash flow means operating income plus time brokerage agreement fees  depreciation  amortization  corporate expense and non cash compensation
