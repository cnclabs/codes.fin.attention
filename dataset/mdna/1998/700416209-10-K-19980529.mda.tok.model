item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
park is a leading global designer and producer of advanced electronic materials used to fabricate complex multilayer printed circuit boards  semiconductor packages and other electronic interconnection systems 
in october  the company acquired dielektra gmbh  a manufacturer of advanced electronic materials  including continuously produced copper clad laminates and mass laminated multilayer panels  located in cologne  germany 
the company s customers for its advanced printed circuit materials include leading independent circuit board fabricators and large electronic equipment manufacturers in the computer  telecommunications  transportation  aerospace and instrumentation industries 
the company s electronic materials operations accounted for approximately of the company s total net sales worldwide in the fiscal year and approximately of net sales worldwide in each of the preceding two fiscal years 
the company s foreign electronic materials operations accounted for approximately of the company s total net sales worldwide in the fiscal year and approximate ly of net sales worldwide in each of the preceding two fiscal years 
park is also engaged in the engineered materials business  which consists of the company s specialty adhesive tape business and advanced composite business  both of which operate as independent business units 
in addition  park operates a plumbing hardware business 
the company s engineered material and plumbing hardware businesses accounted for approximately of the company s total net sales worldwide in the fiscal year and approximately of net sales worldwide in each of the preceding two fiscal years 
the company s sales growth during the last three fiscal years has been led by strong growth in sales by its north american and asian electronic materials operations 
during the fiscal year  the sales of dielektra contributed to this growth  and during the and fiscal years  increased sales by the company s european operations also contributed to this growth 
the company s ongoing efforts to expand its higher technology  higher margin product lines have been significant factors in the growth of the company s sales of electronic materials during this period 
the company introduced several new electronic materials products during the past three fiscal years 
sales volume of the company s electronic materials segment has increased during each of the last three fiscal years 
however  growth of the company s electronic materials business was constrained during these fiscal years by the company s available manufacturing capacity 
the company has significantly expanded the manufacturing capacity of its new york  california  arizona and singapore facilities during the last three fiscal years and is planning additional expansions of its electronic materials operations in california  new york  arizona  europe and singapore during the fiscal year 
during the company s fiscal year and for several years prior thereto  more than of the company s total sales were to delco electron ics corporation  a subsidiary of general motors corp 
sales to delco electronics represented  and of the company s total sales worldwide for the  and fiscal years  respectively 
in march of the company was informed by delco that delco planned to close its printed circuit board fabrication plant and completely exit the printed circuit board manufacturing business 
after the plant closure  which is expected to occur during the first half of the company s fiscal year  delco will no longer be a customer of the company 
in may  the company and its subsidiary  nelco technology  inc  filed a complaint against delco electronics corporation and delphi automotive systems  inc also a subsidiary of general motors corp 
in the united states district court for the district of arizona 
the complaint alleges  among other things  that delco breached its contract to purchase semi finished multilayer printed circuit boards from nelco and that delphi interfered with nelco s contract with delco and seeks compensatory and punitive damages of not less than million 
the company plans to aggressively market its high technology semi finished multilayer circuit board material manufacturing capability to leading printed circuit board fabricators  contract assemblers and electronic original equipment manufacturers in north america 
the company has not previously been able to aggressively market this capability as it has been largely committed to supplying delco electronics 
although the company s electronic materials segment is not dependent on this single customer  the loss of this customer may have a material adverse effect on the business of this segment in the fiscal year ending february  and in subsequent fiscal years 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year the company s electronic materials business was largely responsible for the improvement in the company s results of operations for the fiscal year ended march  the north american and asian markets for sophisticated printed circuit materials were strong during the fiscal year  and the company s electronic materials operations located in these regions performed well as a result 
the market in europe for sophisticated printed circuit materials was not as strong as in north america or asia  although the company s european operations benefited from the acquisition of dielektra  resulting in higher sales and improved profitability 
during most of the fiscal year  the company s electronic materials business experienced improved efficiencies resulting from the operation of its facilities at levels close to their designed manufacturing capacity  which favorably impacted the company s margins 
operating results of the company s engineered materials businesses and plumbing hardware business improved during the fiscal year 
results of operations sales for the fiscal year ended march  increased to million from million for the fiscal year ended march  sales of the electronic materials business for the fiscal year were million  or of total sales worldwide  compared with million  or of total sales worldwide  for the fiscal year 
this increase in sales of electronic materials was principally the result of higher volume of electronic materials shipped  an increase in sales of higher technology products and the inclusion of dielektra in the company s sales since the date of acquisition 
sales of the engineered materials businesses continued to grow during the fiscal year as the result of increased volume of materials shipped and the addition of new products 
the sales increase by the engineered materials business was overshadowed by the reduced sales of the plumbing hardware business  which resulted in an overall decline of in the engineered materials and plumbing hardware segment to million in the fiscal year from million in the fiscal year 
the company s foreign operations accounted for million of sales  or of the company s total sales worldwide  during the fiscal year compared with million of sales  or of total sales worldwide  during the fiscal year 
sales by the company s foreign operations during the fiscal year increased from the fiscal year 
the increase in sales by the company s foreign operations in the fiscal year was principally due to the inclusion of dielektra in the company s sales and an increase in sales by the company s asian electronic materials operations 
an expansion of the company s singapore manufacturing facility was completed at the end of the company s fiscal year  and the company further expanded the manufacturing capacity of its facility in singapore during the fiscal year 
the gross margin for the company s worldwide operations was during the fiscal year compared with for the fiscal year 
the improvement in the gross margin was attributable to the increase in sales volume over the prior fiscal year  the continuing growth in sales of higher technology  higher margin products and efficiencies resulting from operating the company s facilities at levels close to their designed capacity 
this improvement was partially offset by a million pre tax charge included in the cost of sales in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year to write down certain fixed assets that will no longer be utilized in the company s plumbing hardware business and in the company s semi finished multilayer printed circuit board business 
selling  general and administrative expenses  measured as a percentage of sales  were during the fiscal year compared with during the fiscal year 
this increase was a function of increased general and administrative expenses  resulting  in part  from higher employee bonus and profit sharing expenses due to higher operating profits 
for the reasons set forth above  profit from operations for the fiscal year increased to million from million for the fiscal year 
interest and other income  principally investment income  increased to million for the fiscal year from million for the fiscal year 
the increase in investment income was attributable to the increase in cash available for investment and an increase in the prevailing interest rates during the current year 
the company s investments were primarily short term taxable instruments and government securities 
interest expense for the fiscal year was million compared with the same amount during the fiscal year 
the company s effective income tax rate for the fiscal year was compared with for the fiscal year 
this increase in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of less favorable foreign tax rate differentials and a change in the domestic sales mix into states with higher tax rates 
net earnings for the fiscal year increased to million from million for the fiscal year 
basic and diluted earnings per share increased to and  respectively  for the fiscal year from and  respectively  for the fiscal year 
this increase in net earnings and earnings per share was primarily attributable to the increase in the profit from operations offset  in part  by the higher effective tax rate 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year the company s electronic materials business was responsible for the decline in the company s results of operations for the fiscal year ended march  the north american  european and asian markets for sophisti cated printed circuit materials experienced weakness during the first half of the fiscal year which continued into the third quarter in the north american and european markets 
the company believes this weakness was principally attributable to an industry wide inventory correction that began in the first quarter 
during the fiscal year  the company s electronic materials business experienced inefficiencies caused by operating its facilities at levels significantly lower than their designed manufacturing capacity in the first three quarters and faced price pressure from its customers resulting in an inability to pass along raw material cost increases which it received earlier in the fiscal year 
these factors adversely affected the company s margins 
the company s performance during the fiscal year was also adversely affected by significant disruptions of the company s business with its largest customer  delco electronics corporation  caused by the canadian auto workers and united auto workers strikes against general motors in the first and third quarters of the fiscal year 
the improvement in the company s margins in the second quarter over the first quarter was achieved from internal operating adjustments in response to the industry downturn that occurred in the first quarter and the return of delco electronics to more normal business levels after the aforementioned strikes 
the improvement in the company s margins in the fourth quarter over the third quarter resulted from the return of delco electronics to more normal business levels after the aforementioned strikes and the strengthening of the market for the company s products in the fourth quarter 
operating results of the company s engineered materials and plumbing hardware business improved considerably during the fiscal year and accounted for approximately of the company s total operating profit 
results of operations sales for the fiscal year ended march  increased to million from million for the fiscal year ended march  sales of the electronic materials business for the fiscal year were million  or of total sales worldwide  compared with million  or of total sales worldwide  for the fiscal year 
this increase in sales of electronic materials was principally the result of higher volume of electronic materials shipped and an increase in sales of higher technology products 
sales of the engineered materials and plumbing hardware business for the fiscal year increased to million from million for the fiscal year due primarily to increased sales in the specialty adhesive tape and advanced composite materials businesses resulting from new products and higher volumes in both businesses 
the company s foreign operations accounted for million of sales  or of the company s total sales worldwide  during the fiscal year compared with million of sales  or of total sales worldwide  during the fiscal year 
sales by the company s foreign operations during the fiscal year increased from the fiscal year 
while sales by each of the company s foreign operations were higher in the fiscal year compared with the fiscal year  the increase in sales by foreign operations was principally due to an increase in sales by the company s asian operations 
the gross margin for the company s worldwide operations was during the fiscal year compared with for the fiscal year 
the decline in the gross margin was attributable to inefficiencies resulting from dramatic volume fluctuations during the year  the impact of disruptions to the company s business with its largest customer  delco electronics corporation  due to strikes against general motors  selling price pressure and operating certain facilities at levels lower than their designed capacity  which were partially offset by the continuing growth in sales of higher technology  higher margin products 
selling  general and administrative expenses  measured as a percentage of sales  were during the fiscal year compared with during the fiscal year 
this reduction was a function of the partially fixed nature of the selling  general and administrative expenses relative to the increase in sales and lower incentive payments due to lower operating profits 
for the reasons set forth above  profit from operations for the fiscal year decreased to million from million for the fiscal year 
interest and other income  principally investment income  increased to million for the fiscal year from million for the fiscal year 
interest expense for the fiscal year was million compared with million during the fiscal year 
the increases in investment income and interest expense were attributable to the increase in cash available for investment and the additional interest expense resulting from the company s issuance of million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due at the end of the fiscal year 
the company s investments were primarily short term taxable instruments and government securities 
the company s effective income tax rate for the fiscal year was compared with for the fiscal year 
this decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of favorable foreign tax rate differentials 
net earnings for the fiscal year were million compared to million for the fiscal year 
basic and diluted earnings per share decreased to and  respectively  for the fiscal year from and  respectively  for the fiscal year 
this decrease in net earnings and earnings per share was primarily attributable to the decrease in the profit from operations 
liquidity and capital resources at march   the company s cash and temporary investments were million compared with million at march   the end of the company s fiscal year 
the increase in the company s cash and investment position at march  was attributable to cash provided from operating activities in excess of investments in property  plant and equipment  as discussed below 
the company s working capital was million at march  compared with million at march  the increase at march  compared with march  was due principally to the increases in cash and inventories  offset in part by higher accrued liabilities and accounts payable 
the increase in inventories at march  compared with march  was due principally to increased raw material and finished goods levels in support of higher sales and the inclusion of dielektra s inventory in the company s current ratio the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at march  compared with to at march  during the fiscal year  the company generated funds from operations of million and expended million for the net purchase of property  plant and equipment 
cash provided by net earnings before depreciation and amortization of million combined with a net decrease in non cash working capital items resulted in million of cash provided from operating activities 
a significant portion of the fiscal year s capital expenditures related to installation of additional capacity at the company s electronic materials facilities in california and singapore 
these expansions will increase the company s capacity and capability for the production of sophisticated printed circuit materials 
net expenditures for property  plant and equipment were million  million and million in the  and fiscal years  respectively 
the company expects the level of capital expenditures in the fiscal year to be in excess of the expenditures in the fiscal year 
the company is planning further expansions of its electronic materials operations in the united states  asia and europe 
at march   the company s only long term debt was the convertible subordinated notes due the notes issued at the end of the fiscal year 
the company believes its financial resources will be sufficient  for the foreseeable future  to provide for continued investment in property  plant and equipment and for general corporate purposes 
such resources  including the proceeds from the notes  would also be available for appropriate acquisitions and other expansions of the company s business 
the company has reviewed its worldwide computer systems for year readiness and is in the process of implementing a plan to resolve existing issues 
as part of ongoing system development programs  the company is modifying or replacing existing computer programs so that they will function properly with respect to dates in the year and beyond 
the company anticipates all critical systems will be modified for year compliance by mid and believes that after such modifications have been completed year issues will not pose significant operational problems 
management does not expect that the cost of year modifications will have a material adverse effect on the liquidity  capital resources  business or consolidated financial position of the company 
environmental matters the company is subject to various federal  state and local government requirements relating to the protection of the environment 
the company believes that  as a general matter  its policies  practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmen tal damage and that its handling  manufacture  use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances are in accord with environmental laws and regulations 
however  mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies  which were generally in compliance with applicable laws at the time of the operations in question  the company  like other companies engaged in similar businesses  is a party to claims by government agencies and third parties and has incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs associated with environmental matters 
additional claims and costs involving past environmental matters may continue to arise in the future 
it is the company s policy to record appropriate liabilities for such matters when remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
in the  and fiscal years  the company charged approximately million  million and million  respectively  against pretax income for remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs including legal fees 
while annual expenditures have generally been constant from year to year  and may increase over time  the company expects it will be able to fund such expenditures from cash flow from operations 
the timing of expenditures depends on a number of factors  including regulatory approval of cleanup projects  remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties 
at march   the recorded liability in accrued liabilities for environmental matters was million compared with million at march  the increase in this liability at march  was due to accrued liabilities for environmental matters at dielektra gmbh  which the company acquired in october dielektra s environmental liability is for various compliance and remediation costs expected to be incurred at its facility in cologne  germany over the next several years 
management does not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the liquidity  capital resources  business or consolidated financial position of the company 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for a discussion of the company s commitments and contingencies  including those related to environmental matters 
factors that may affect future results 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their companies without fear of litigation so long as those statements are identified as forward looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the statement 
accordingly  the company hereby identifies the following important factors which could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from any such results which might be projected  forecast  estimated or budgeted by the company in forward looking state ments 

the company s customer base is concentrated  in part  because the company s business strategy has been to develop long term relation ships with a select group of customers 
during the company s fiscal year ended march   the company s ten largest customers accounted for approximately of net sales 
the company expects that sales to a relatively small number of customers will continue to account for a significant portion of its net sales for the foreseeable future 
a loss of one or more of such key customers could affect the company s profitability 
see business electronic materials operations customers and end markets in item of this report  legal proceedings in item of this report  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item of this report and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for discussions of the loss of a key customer early in the fiscal year 

the company s business is dependent on certain aspects of the electronics industry  which is a cyclical industry and which has experienced recurring downturns 
the downturns  such as occurred in the first quarter of the company s fiscal year ended march   can be unexpected and have often reduced demand for  and prices of  electronic materials 

the company s operating results are affected by a number of factors  including various factors beyond the company s control 
such factors include economic conditions in the electronics industry  the timing of customer orders  product prices  process yields  the mix of products sold and maintenance related shutdowns of facilities 
operating results also can be influenced by development and introduction of new products and the costs associated with the start up of new facilities 

rapid technological advances in semiconductors and electronic equipment have placed rigorous demands on the electronic materials manufactured by the company and used in printed circuit board production 
the company s operating results will be affected by the company s ability to maintain and increase its technological and manufacturing capability and expertise in this rapidly changing industry 

the electronic materials industry is intensely competitive and the company competes worldwide in the market for materials used in the production of complex multilayer printed circuit boards 
the company s competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than the company  and the company s operating results will be affected by its ability to maintain its competitive position in the industry 

there are a limited number of qualified suppliers of the principal materials used by the company in its manufacture of electronic materials products 
substitutes for these products are not readily available  and in the recent past there have been shortages in the market for certain of these materials 

the company typically does not obtain long term purchase orders or commitments 
instead  it relies primarily on continual communica tion with its customers to anticipate the future volume of purchase orders 
a variety of conditions  both specific to the individual customer and generally affecting the customer s industry  can cause a customer to reduce or delay orders previously anticipated by the company 

the company  from time to time  is engaged in the expansion of certain of its manufacturing facilities for electronic materials 
the anticipated costs of such expansions cannot be determined with precision and may vary materially from those budgeted 
in addition  such expansions will increase the company s fixed costs 
the company s future profitability depends upon its ability to utilize its manufacturing capacity in an effective manner 

the company s business is capital intensive and  in addition  the introduction of new technologies could substantially increase the company s capital expenditures 
in order to remain competitive the company must continue to make significant investments in capital equipment and expansion of operations 
this may require that the company continue to be able to access capital on terms acceptable to the company 

the company may acquire businesses  product lines or technologies that expand or complement those of the company 
the integration and management of an acquired company or business may strain the company s management resources and technical  financial and operating systems 
in addition  implementation of acquisitions can result in large one time charges and costs 
a given acquisition  if consummated  may materially affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 

the company s international operations are subject to risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  exchange rates  tariffs and other barriers  political and economic instabil ity and potentially adverse tax consequences 

a portion of the sales and costs of the company s international operations are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar and may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

the company s success is dependent upon its relationship with key management and technical personnel 

the company s future success depends in part upon its intellectual property which the company seeks to protect through a combination of contract provisions  trade secret protections  copyrights and patents 

the company s production processes require the use  storage  treatment and disposal of certain materials which are considered hazardous under applicable environmental laws and the company is subject to a variety of regulatory requirements relating to the handling of such materials and the release of emissions and effluents into the environment 
other possible developments  such as the enactment or adoption of additional environmental laws  could result in substantial costs to the company 

the market price of the company s securities can be subject to fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  changes in analysts earnings estimates  market conditions in the electronic materials industry  as well as general economic conditions and other factors external to the company 

the company s results could be affected by changes in the company s accounting policies and practices or changes in the company s organization  compensation and benefit plans  or changes in the company s material agreements or understandings with third parties
