item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the progenitor to celgene was organized in as a unit of celanese corporation  a major chemical company 
celgene s initial mandate was to apply biotechnology to the production of fine and specialty chemicals 
following the merger of celanese corporation with american hoechst corporation  celgene was spun out as a separate company 
in  celgene completed an initial public offering of its common stock  and commenced the development of chemical and biotreatment processes for the chemical and pharmaceutical industry 
celgene discontinued the biotreatment operations in to focus on its targeted small molecule immunotherapeutic compound development and biocatalytic chiral chemistry synthesis platforms 
since  the company s revenues have been generated primarily through the research and development relating to  and supply of  chirally pure intermediates to pharmaceutical companies for use in new drug development and  to a lesser degree  from agrochemical research and development contracts 
however  as the company developed its immunotherapeutic program  sales of chirally pure intermediates became a less integral part of the company s strategic focus 
accordingly  on november   the company signed a letter of intent with cambrex corporation to sell celgene s chiral intermediate business for million 
the sale was completed on january  the terms provide for a payment of million at closing and the present value equivalent of million in future royalties  with certain minimum royalty payments in the third through the sixth years after closing 
the company has sustained losses in each year since its incorporation in in  the company had a net loss from continuing operations of million  and at december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
the net loss from discontinued operations ie chiral intermediates for was  the company expects to make substantial expenditures to further its immunotherapeutic program  to commercialize thalomid and to expand the chiral crop protection business  and  based on these expenditures  it is likely that losses will continue for at least the next to months 
subject to the risks described elsewhere in this annual report the company believes that there are significant market opportunities for the products and processes under development by the company 
to address these opportunities in a timely and effective manner  the company intends to seek out collaborations and licensing arrangements with third parties 
the company has entered into agreements covering the manufacture and distribution for the company of certain compounds  such as thalomid  and research and development by the company covering processes for producing chirally pure crop protection agents for license to agrochemical manufacturers 
celgene has established a sales and marketing organization to commercialize thalomid subject to regulatory approval of the product  and currently employs persons in this capacity 
the company intends to develop and market its own pharmaceuticals for indications with smaller patient populations 
for drugs with indications for larger patient populations  the company anticipates partnering with other pharmaceutical companies 
the company also anticipates partnering with companies for the development and commercialization of the company s chirally pure pharmaceutical and agrochemical products 
celgene expects that these arrangements typically will include milestone payments  reimbursement of research and development expenses and royalty arrangements 
future operating results will depend on many factors  including demand for the company s products  regulatory approvals  the timing of the introduction and market acceptance of new products by the company or competing companies  partner support payments  the company s ability to control costs  and its ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific and management personnel 
results of operations fiscal years ended december   and total revenues 
total revenues increased by to approximately million from approximately  in the company s revenues for represented an increase of over revenues of approximately  revenues were primarily from research contracts for the years  and research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for increased by to approximately million from approximately million in this increase was due to an increase of approximately  of expenses associated with the company s chiral pharmaceutical program primarily in clinical trials and million of expenses associated with the company s celgro subsidiary 
the increase in expenses for celgro was primarily facility and personnel charges related to establishing a separate location for the chiral agrochemical business 
research and development expenses for increased by to approximately million from approximately million in this increase was due to an increase of approximately million of expenses associated with the company s immunotherapeutic program  million of expenses associated with the initiation of the chiral pharmaceutical development program and  of expenses associated with the formation of the chiral agrochemical business 
the major factors contributing to the increased cost of the company s immunotherapeutic programs resulted from increases in the following expense categories preclinical and clinical trial expenses  approximately million  regulatory and compliance expenses  approximately million  manufacturing costs for developmental quantities of thalomid  approximately  and other ongoing research expenses  approximately million 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for increased by to approximately million from approximately million in this was primarily due to the formation of a sales and marketing organization in anticipation of the thalomid product launch as well as an increase in certain support functions resulting from the anticipated transition to a commercial operation 
major increases were as follows sales and marketing expense of million for sales force recruiting and training and other pre launch expenses  medical affairs and safety costs of  additional finance personnel and information systems development costs of  executive and administrative costs for the new celgro subsidiary of  and other administrative expenses such as legal  consulting and investor relations of approximately  selling  general and administrative expenses for increased by from approximately million in this increase was due primarily to the initial formation of a small sales and marketing organization in preparation for the thalomid product launch  the addition of product liability coverage to the company s insurance  recruiting expenses  and higher consulting and legal expenses associated with the shareholder rights agreement adopted in september interest income and interest expense 
interest income for decreased by to  from approximately million in the decrease was due to lower average cash balances in interest income for increased by from approximately  in this increase was attributable to higher average cash balances in due to the million of net proceeds from the series a convertible preferred stock offering in march interest expense for decreased to approximately  from  and for decreased from approximately  in the decrease in both years was due to the conversion to equity of the convertible debentures issued in net loss from continuing operations 
the net loss from continuing operations increased to approximately million from approximately million in the increase was due primarily to spending related to the anticipated launch of thalomid and ongoing research programs in chiral pharmaceuticals and the company s celgro subsidiary 
the net loss from continuing operations for increased by from approximately million in reflecting increased spending in immunotherapeutics  the start of a thalomid marketing organization and the start of the chiral pharmaceutical development program 
net loss from discontinued operations 
the net loss from discontinued operations decreased by to approximately  in from  in the reduced loss was primarily a result of an increase in revenues from million in to million in offset by 
million of operating expenses in the net loss from discontinued operations for decreased by from million in the decreased loss was due to a million increase in revenues in and a decrease in expenses  primarily research and development expenses  of approximately 
million 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  the company has financed its working capital requirements primarily through private and public sales of its debt and equity securities  income earned on the investment of the proceeds from the sale of such securities  and revenues from research contracts and product sales 
the company has raised approximately million in net proceeds from three public and three private offerings  including its initial public offering in july in july  the company issued and sold in a private placement offering million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due july  for total net proceeds  after offering costs  of approximately million 
as of december   all of the convertible debentures had been converted into common stock 
in march  the company issued and sold in a private placement offering shares of series a convertible preferred stock at  per share  for total gross proceeds of approximately million and net proceeds  after offering costs  of approximately million 
as of december  all but series a shares million had been converted to common stock 
on june   in a private placement  the company completed the sale of  shares of series b convertible preferred stock at an issue price of  per share 
the company received net proceeds  after offering costs  of million 
as of december   all shares of series b preferred had been converted to common stock 
on december  the company completed the sale of million shares of common stock at a price of per share  in a public offering 
net proceeds after underwriting discounts and commissions were million 
see notes and to the financial statements 
the company s net working capital at december  decreased by to approximately million primarily cash and cash equivalents from approximately million at december  the decrease in working capital was primarily due to the increased rate of spending as previously discussed 
cash and cash equivalents increased by million in while marketable securities decreased by million from this reflects the receipt in december of funds from the secondary public offering  which were not yet invested in marketable securities 
current research commitments for are approximately  primarily to rockefeller university  and glasgow university 
in addition a contract with boston university was entered into for the prescription monitoring program associated with the anticipated sale of thalomid 
the commitment for is the company expects that its rate of spending will increase as the result of increased clinical trial costs and expenses associated with the regulatory approval process and commercialization of products now in development 
in order to assure funding for the company s future operations  the company may need to seek additional capital resources 
however  no assurances can be given that the company will be successful in raising additional capital 
if the company is unable to raise additional funds  the company believes that its current financial resources including the proceeds of million from the chiral chemical intermediate business sale in january and right to sell another million of series b preferred stock by june  could fund operations based on reduced levels of research and development and administrative activities through as of december   the company had for federal income tax purposes a net operating loss carryforward of approximately million 
if not utilized to offset future taxable income  such loss carryforward will expire between and certain events  including any sales by the company of shares of its stock and or transfers of a substantial number of shares of common stock by the current stockholders  may restrict the ability of the company to utilize its net operating loss carryforward 
market risk the company does not use derivative financial instruments 
the company s series a convertible preferred stock is subject to market risk due to its conversion feature 
as of december   shares were issued and outstanding along with accretion of  for a total value outstanding of  the conversion feature provides for conversion into common stock at the lesser of i or ii of the average closing price per share of common stock for the seven trading days immediately prior to the date of conversion  which at december  was 
based on a reduction in the average stock price the company would have to issue approximately  additional shares of common stock upon conversion 
if there was a increase in the average stock price the company would issue approximately  less shares of common stock upon conversion 
the company s series b preferred stock if it was to be issued in has a market adjustable defined conversion price 
year computer systems compliance many older computer software programs refer to years in terms of their final two digits only 
such programs may interpret the year to mean the year instead 
if not corrected  those programs could cause date related transaction failures 
during  the company s senior management created and filled the position of chief information officer 
among other duties  the cio has the responsibility to have all systems and computers year compliant by mid year to date  all personal computers  with the exception of several computers connected to laboratory analytic equipment  have been replaced with year compliant machines 
all office applications and the adverse event reporting software are year compliant 
a new financial system software package is scheduled to be installed in the second quarter and is year compliant 
the company is confident that by year end  all critical systems and software will have been addressed and an assessment as to the date critical nature of the laboratory computers will be complete with a plan to replace those machines if necessary by early additional costs to correct year problems are not expected to be material 
based on current plans and efforts to date  the company expects that there will be no material adverse effect on our operations 
there is no guarantee  however  that all problems will be foreseen and corrected  that year problems at the company s suppliers  customers and at governmental agencies will not adversely affect the company  or that no material disruption of the company s business will occur as a result of year problems
