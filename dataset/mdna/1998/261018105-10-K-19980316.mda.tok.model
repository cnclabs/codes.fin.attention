prior to  the bank conducted substantial commercial and residential real estate development and investment activities  primarily retail neighborhood shopping centers located in california  principally through its subsidiary  dsl service company  an active wholly owned real estate subsidiary of the bank 
since the passage in august of the financial institutions reform  recovery  and enforcement act of firrea  the bank s ability to engage in new real estate development activities and retain existing real estate investments has been curtailed dramatically  and such activities may be economically unfeasible for the bank because of the capital requirements for such activities 
since firrea  the bank has been engaged in significant efforts to reduce its real estate investments and is now within allowable limits for its investment in dsl service company and other equity investments 
downey s operations are significantly influenced by general economic conditions  the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and the regulatory policies of governmental authorities 
deposit flows and the cost of interest bearing liabilities cost of funds to downey are influenced by interest rates on competing investments and general market interest rates 
similarly  downey s loan volume and yields on loans and mbss  and the level of prepayments on such loans and mbss  are affected by market interest rates  as well as additional factors affecting the supply of and demand for housing and the availability of funds 
lending activities historically  downey s lending activities have emphasized the origination of first mortgage loans secured by residential property and retail neighborhood shopping centers  and  to a lesser extent  real estate loans secured by multi family and commercial and industrial properties  including office buildings  land and other properties with income producing capabilities 
in addition  downey has provided construction loan financing for residential both single family and multi family and commercial retail neighborhood shopping center projects  including loans to joint ventures where dsl service company or the bank was a participant 
downey also originates loans to businesses through its commercial banking operations and loans on new and used automobiles through the purchase of motor vehicle sales contracts from auto dealers in california and other western states 
the indirect auto lending program is in addition to automobile loans originated directly through downey s branch network 
during  downey s primary focus will continue to be the origination of adjustable rate single family mortgage loans  particularly subprime loans which carry higher interest rates  and consumer loans 
in addition  downey will continue its secondary marketing activities of selling its production of certain fixed rate single family loans as well as certain adjustable rate mortgage arm loan products 
see lending activities secondary marketing and loan servicing activities on page for additional information on the composition of downey s loan and mbs portfolio  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition loans and mortgage backed securities on page loan and mortgage backed securities portfolio loans receivable held for investment are carried at cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts which are recognized in interest income using the interest method 
mbss represent participating interests in pools of first mortgage loans originated and serviced by the issuers of the securities 
mbss held to maturity are carried at unpaid principal balances  adjusted for unamortized premiums and unearned discounts 
premiums and discounts on mbss are amortized using the interest method over the remaining period to contractual maturity  adjusted for anticipated prepayments 
downey identifies those loans which foreseeably may be sold prior to maturity 
these loans have been classified as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets and are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or market value 
net unrealized losses  if any  are recognized in a valuation allowance by charges to income

residential mortgage loans originated by downey typically have contractual maturities at origination of to years 
to limit the interest rate risk associated with such maturities  downey  among other things  principally originates arms for its own loan portfolio 
fixed rate loans are primarily originated for sale in the secondary market on a non recourse basis for cash 
however  downey occasionally originates for its own portfolio fixed rate loans to facilitate the sale of real estate acquired in settlement of loans and which meet certain yield and other approved guidelines 
see asset liability management on page in addition  the average term of such mortgage loans historically has been significantly shorter than their contractual maturity due to loan payoffs as a result of home sales or refinancings and prepayments 
residential real estate lending downey s primary lending activity is the origination of mortgage loans secured by single family residential properties consisting of one to four units located in california 
such loans are primarily for the purchase of residences or for the refinancing of existing mortgages at lower rates or upon different terms 
at present  downey is primarily originating arms for its portfolio of loans held for investment 
see asset liability management on page downey also originates residential fixed interest rate mortgage loans to meet consumer demand  but intends to sell the majority of all such loans in the secondary market  rather than hold such loans in its portfolio 
in addition  a small volume of residential one to four unit fixed rate loans are originated for investment to facilitate the sale of real estate acquired in settlement of loans and which meet certain yield and other approved guidelines 
see lending activities secondary marketing and loan servicing activities on page downey s arms generally begin with an interest rate below the current market rate incentive rate and adjust to the applicable index plus a defined spread  subject to periodic and lifetime caps  after one  three or six months 
downey s arms generally provide that the maximum rate that can be charged cannot exceed the incentive rate by more than six to nine percentage points  depending on the type of loan and the initial rate offered 
the interest rate adjustment on downey s arms which adjust semi annually generally is limited to per adjustment period 
with respect to arms that adjust monthly  there is a lifetime interest rate cap  but no specified periodic interest rate adjustment cap 
instead  monthly adjustment arms have a periodic cap on changes in required monthly payments  which adjust annually 
monthly adjustment arms allow for negative amortization the addition to loan principal of accrued interest that exceeds the required monthly loan payments 
in the event that a loan incurs significant negative amortization  there is an increased risk that the market value of the underlying collateral on the loan would be insufficient to satisfy fully the outstanding principal and interest 
there is a limit on the amount of negative amortization  such that the principal plus the added amount cannot exceed of the original loan amount for loans originated prior to july and of the original loan amount for loans originated thereafter 
downey permits arms to be assumed by qualified borrowers 
during  approximately of downey s one to four unit residential real estate loans were originated by retail loan representatives of downey 
retail loan representatives typically receive loan referrals from real estate agents  builders  depositors and customers obtained from retail advertising and other sources 
prior to the fourth quarter of  retail loan representatives were compensated on a commission basis 
beginning in the fourth quarter  the compensation program was changed to a salary plus a fixed amount per loan originated 
the remainder of downey s one to four unit residential real estate loans were obtained by downey s wholesale loan representatives but originated through outside mortgage brokers 
wholesale loan representatives are paid on a commission basis 
compensation for the services performed by the mortgage broker is considered in the overall pricing of mortgage loan products 
these mortgage brokers do not operate from downey s offices and are not employees of downey 
downey requires that residential real estate loans be approved at various levels of management  depending upon the amount of the loan 
on a single family residential loan originated for portfolio  the maximum amount downey generally will lend is million 
the average loan size  however  is much lower 
in  the average loan size was  downey generally makes loans with loan to value ratios the ratio of the principal amount of the loan to the appraised value at origination of the property securing the loan not exceeding up to for certain loans made pursuant to downey s low and moderate income lending program under the community reinvestment act cra 
downey will make loans with loan to value ratios of over  but not exceeding of the value of the property  if private mortgage insurance is obtained to reduce the effective loan to value ratio to between to  consistent with secondary marketing requirements 
in addition  downey requires hazard insurance for all residential real estate loans covering the lower of the loan amount or the replacement value of the structure 
in the approval process for the loans it originates or purchases  downey assesses both the value of the property securing the loan and the applicant s ability to repay the loan 
loan underwriters analyze the loan application and the property involved  and qualified staff appraisers or outside appraisers inspect and appraise the property 
all appraisers are approved by downey s chief appraiser or  with respect to federal housing administration fha insured loans  by the fha 
appraisals performed by approved appraisers are selectively reviewed by senior staff appraisers or approved fee review appraisers 
downey also obtains information concerning the income  financial condition  employment and credit history of the applicant 
typically  downey will verify credit information for loans originated by retail loan representatives or other downey employees 
for loans from mortgage brokers  downey requires the mortgage broker to review and verify credit information and employment pursuant to downey s origination procedures 
in addition  downey obtains credit information and performs certain other underwriting tests of such mortgage broker originated loans 
on its arms offered with incentive rates  downey qualifies applicants for loan programs with no negative amortization at the higher of the initial incentive rate plus or the fully indexed rate  with a minimum qualifying rate of for loans having a loan to value ratio of or less  and qualifies applicants at a minimum qualifying rate of for loans having a loan to value ratio of greater than 
for loan programs that include negative amortization  downey qualifies applicants at the lesser of the initial incentive rate plus or the fully indexed rate  with a minimum qualifying rate of for loans having a loan to value ratio of or less  and qualifies applicants at a minimum qualifying rate of for loans having a loan to value ratio of greater than late in  downey began offering one to four unit residential loans to borrowers who have or  in the case of purchases  will have equity in their homes but whose credit rating contains certain exceptions which preclude them from qualifying for the best market terms 
these lower grade credits a  b and c loans  commonly referred to as subprime loans  are characterized by lower loan to value ratios and higher average interest rates than higher credit grade loans a loans 
downey believes these lower credit grade borrowers represent an opportunity to earn a higher net return for the risks assumed 
underwriting guidelines have been developed for each classification of credit 
secondary marketing and loan servicing activities as part of its secondary marketing activities  downey originates certain residential real estate arms and loans with fixed rates with an intent of selling such loans 
accordingly  such loans are classified as held for sale and are carried at the lower of cost or market 
these loans are secured by first liens on one to four unit residential properties and have to year maturities or year amortization periods with balloon payments in five years  seven years or other maturities 
for additional information regarding loans held for investment and for sale  see notes and of notes to the consolidated financial statements on pages and  respectively 
downey utilizes various hedging programs to manage the interest rate risk of its fixed rate mortgage origination process 
see asset liability management on page management of downey believes that servicing loans for others can be an important asset liability management tool because it produces operating results which  in response to changes in market interest rates  tend to move inversely to changes in net interest income 
because arms lag market interest rates  net interest income associated with these loans is expected to decline in periods of rising interest rates and increase in periods of falling rates 
in contrast  the value of the loan servicing portfolio normally increases as interest rates rise and loan prepayments decrease and declines as interest rates fall and loan prepayments increase 
in addition  increased levels of servicing activities can provide additional income with minimal additional overhead costs 
depending upon market pricing for servicing  loans are sold either servicing retained or servicing released 
when sold servicing retained  downey records gains or losses from the sale of loans at the time of sale  which are determined by the difference between the net sales proceeds and the allocated basis of the loans sold 
downey adopted  effective january   statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  sfas 
in accordance with sfas  downey capitalizes mortgage servicing rights msrs acquired through either the purchase or origination of mortgage loans for sale or securitization with servicing rights retained 
the total cost of the mortgage loans designated for sale is allocated to the msrs and the mortgage loans without the msrs based on their relative fair values 
msrs are included in the financial statements in the category of other assets 
impairment losses are recognized through a valuation allowance  with any associated provision recorded as a component of loan servicing fees 
at december   msrs totaled million 
loans originated for sale may be exchanged with government agencies for mbss collateralized by such loans 
downey s cost for the exchange is the payment of a monthly guaranty fee  which is expressed as a percentage of the unpaid principal balance and which is deducted from interest income 
the securities received can be used by downey to collateralize various types of borrowings at rates which frequently are more favorable than rates on other types of liabilities and also carry a lower risk based capital requirement than whole loans 
such mbss available for sale are carried at fair value 
however  no gain or loss on the exchange is recorded in the statement of income until the securities are sold to a third party 
all changes in fair value prior to the sale to third parties are shown as a separate component of stockholders equity  net of income taxes 
commercial real estate and multi family lending downey has provided permanent loans secured by retail neighborhood shopping centers and multi family properties 
downey s commercial real estate lending and multi family activities are conducted by downey s major loan account officers who are compensated on a salary basis 
commercial real estate and multi family loans generally entail additional risks as compared to single family residential mortgage lending 
each loan  including loans to facilitate the sale of real estate owned  is subject to downey s underwriting standards  which generally include an evaluation of the creditworthiness and reputation of the borrower  the amount of the borrower s equity in the project as determined on the basis of appraisal  sales and leasing information on the property and cash flow projections 
to protect the value of the security for downey s loan  downey requires casualty insurance for the loan amount or replacement cost 
in addition  for non residential loans in excess of  downey requires the borrower to obtain comprehensive general liability insurance 
all commercial real estate loans originated by downey require the approval of at least two officers  one of whom must be the originating loan account officer and the other a designated officer with appropriate loan approval authority 
construction lending downey has provided construction loan financing for residential both single family and multi family and commercial real estate projects eg  retail neighborhood shopping centers 
downey originates such loans principally through its major loan officers 
construction loans generally are made at floating rates based upon the prime or reference rate of a major commercial bank 
generally  downey requires a loan to value ratio of or less on construction lending and subjects each loan to downey s underwriting standards 
construction loans involve risks different from completed project lending because loan funds are advanced upon the security of the project under construction  and if the loan goes into default  additional funds may have to be advanced to complete the project before it can be sold 
moreover  construction projects are subject to uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs  potential delays in construction time  market demand and the accuracy of the estimate of value upon completion 
downey requires the general contractor to  among other things  carry contractor s liability insurance equal to certain prescribed minimum amounts  carry builder s risk insurance and have a blanket bond against employee misappropriation 
commercial lending downey originates commercial loans and revolving lines of credit  and issues standby letters of credit for its middle market commercial customers 
the various credit products are offered on both a secured and unsecured basis with interest rates being either fixed or variable 
the portfolio emphasis is toward secured  floating rate credit facilities 
the activities are directed through the commercial banking group with the focus on long term relationship based customers 
the retail branch network is also utilized as a source of commercial customers  typically managed by the branch manager 
the smaller branch originated business borrowers are desirable due to their lower cost deposit accounts which usually accompany the relationship 
consumer lending downey originates fixed rate automobile loans primarily through an indirect lending program of downey auto finance corp 
which utilizes preapproved automobile dealers to finance consumer purchases of new and used automobiles 
this operation is centralized at downey s headquarters and utilizes technology to process and evaluate loan applications  including credit scoring and the automated retrieval of consumer credit bureau files 
in addition to indirect automobile lending through downey auto finance corp  the bank originates direct automobile loans  home equity loans and lines of credit  and other consumer loan products 
before making a consumer loan  downey assesses the applicant s ability to repay the loan and  if applicable  the value of the collateral securing the loan 
the risk involved with home equity loans and lines of credit is similar to the risk involved with residential real estate loans 
downey offers customers a credit card through a third party  which extends the credit and services the loans made to downey s customers 
investment activities federal and state regulations require the bank to maintain a specified minimum amount of liquid assets invested in certain short term obligations and other securities 
for additional information regarding liquidity requirements and the bank s compliance therewith  see regulation regulation of the bank liquidity requirements on page and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition capital resources and liquidity on page as a federally chartered savings association  the bank is also permitted to make certain other securities investments as prescribed under hola and ots regulations 
investment decisions are made by authorized officers of the bank within guidelines established by the bank s board of directors 
such investments are managed in an effort to produce the highest yield consistent with maintaining safety of principal  minimization of interest rate risk and compliance with applicable regulations 
securities held for investment are carried at cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts which are recognized as interest income using the interest method 
for further information on the composition of downey s investment portfolio  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition investment securities on page real estate investments historically  real estate development and joint venture operations have been a significant part of downey s business activities 
these operations have been conducted principally through the bank s wholly owned service corporation subsidiary  dsl service company 
the bank also engaged in these activities directly  to a limited extent  but no longer has any such investments 
since the passage in august of firrea  the ability to engage in new real estate development and joint venture activities and to retain existing real estate investments has been curtailed dramatically  and such activities may be economically unfeasible for the bank because of the capital requirements imposed on such activities 
firrea requires  with certain limited exceptions  a savings institution such as the bank to exclude from its regulatory capital its investments in  and extensions of credit to  real estate subsidiaries such as dsl service company  as well as its direct equity investments  and prohibits new direct equity investments in real estate by the bank 
since july   the bank has been required to deduct the full amount of its investment in dsl service company in calculating its applicable ratios under the core  tangible and risk based capital standards 
savings associations generally may invest in service corporation subsidiaries  such as dsl service company  to the extent of of assets  plus up to an additional of assets for investments which serve primarily community  inner city or community development purposes 
in addition  conforming loans by an association to such subsidiaries and their joint venture investments are limited to of risk based capital 
conforming loans are those generally limited to of appraised value  bear a market rate of interest and require payments sufficient to amortize the principal balance of the loan 
downey is in compliance with each of these investment limitations 
to the extent real estate investments are made by downey or a subsidiary of downey other than the bank or its subsidiaries  the above mentioned capital deductions and limitations do not apply as they only pertain to such investments by savings associations or their subsidiaries 
for further information  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition investments in real estate and joint ventures on page sources of funds deposits downey prefers to use deposits as the principal source of funds for supporting its lending activities  because the cost of these funds generally is less than that of borrowings or other funding sources with comparable maturities 
downey s savings deposits traditionally have been obtained primarily from the areas in southern and northern california surrounding the bank s branch offices 
however  downey also occasionally raises certain retail deposits through wall street activities 
deposit flows are affected by general economic conditions 
funds may flow from depository institutions such as savings associations into direct vehicles such as government and corporate securities or other financial intermediaries 
the ability of downey to attract and retain deposits will continue to be affected by money market conditions and prevailing interest rates 
generally  rates set by downey are not restricted by state or federal regulation 
in  downey began establishing full service branch facilities in selected market locations throughout southern california 
each in store branch offers a full range of financial services including checking and savings accounts as well as residential and consumer loans 
when consistent with the maintenance of appropriate capital levels  downey may consider opportunities to augment its retail branch system and deposit base through selected branch or deposit acquisitions 
for further information  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition deposits on page borrowings downey s principal source of funds has been and continues to be deposits raised through its retail branch system 
at various times  however  downey has utilized other sources to fund its loan origination and other business activities 
downey has from time to time relied upon borrowings from the fhlb of san francisco as an additional source of funds 
advances are made pursuant to several different credit programs offered by the fhlb 
in  downey initiated a program to sell commercial paper supported by an irrevocable letter of credit issued by the fhlb of san francisco 
at december   the irrevocable fhlb letter of credit was million 
the commercial paper provides downey with an alternative funding source to fund asset growth in a cost effective manner 
from time to time  downey utilizes securities and mortgage loans sold under agreements to repurchase as additional sources of funds 
these reverse repurchase agreements are generally short term  and are collateralized by mortgage backed or investment securities and mortgage loans 
downey only deals with investment banking firms which are recognized as primary dealers in us government securities or major commercial banks in connection with such reverse repurchase agreements 
in addition  downey limits the amounts of borrowings from any single institution 
for further information  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition borrowings on page asset liability management savings institutions are subject to interest rate risks to the degree that their interest bearing liabilities  consisting principally of customer deposits  fhlb advances and other borrowings  mature or reprice more rapidly  or on a different basis  than their interest earning assets  which consist predominantly of intermediate or long term real estate loans 
while having liabilities that on average mature or reprice more frequently than assets may be beneficial in times of declining interest rates  such an asset liability structure may result in declining net earnings during periods of rising interest rates 
a principal objective of downey is to manage the effects of adverse changes in interest rates on downey s interest income while maintaining asset quality and an acceptable interest rate spread 
to improve the rate sensitivity and maturity balance of its interest earning assets and liabilities  downey has over the past several years emphasized the origination of loans with adjustable interest rates or relatively short maturities 
loans with adjustable interest rates have the beneficial effect of allowing the yield on downey s assets to increase during periods of rising interest rates  although such loans have contractual limitations on the frequency and extent of interest rate adjustments 
for further information see lending activities on page and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition asset liability management and market risk on page earnings spread downey s net interest income is determined by the difference the interest rate spread between the yields earned by downey on its loans  mbss and investment securities interest earning assets and the interest rates paid by downey on its deposits and borrowings interest bearing liabilities  as well as the relative dollar amounts of downey s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the effective interest rate spread  which reflects the relative level of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities  equals i the difference between interest income on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  ii divided by average interest earning assets for the period 
for information regarding net income and the components thereof and for management s analysis of financial condition and results of operations  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations beginning on page for returns on assets and other selected financial data see selected financial data on page competition downey faces competition both in attracting deposits and in making real estate loans and other loans 
its most direct competition for deposits has historically come from other savings institutions and from commercial banks located in its principal market areas  including many large financial institutions based in other parts of the country or their subsidiaries 
in addition  there is additional significant competition for investors funds from short term money market securities and other corporate and government securities 
the ability of downey to attract and retain savings deposits depends  generally  on its ability to provide a rate of return  liquidity and risk comparable to that offered by competing investment opportunities and the appropriate level of customer service 
downey experiences competition for real estate loans principally from other savings institutions  commercial banks  mortgage banking companies and insurance companies 
downey competes for loans principally through the interest rates and loan fees it charges and the efficiency and quality of services it provides borrowers and real estate brokers 
employees at december   downey had approximately full time employees and part time employees 
downey provides its employees with certain health and welfare benefits and a retirement and savings plan 
additionally  downey offers qualifying employees participation in a stock purchase plan 
see notes and of notes to the consolidated financial statements on pages and  for a further discussion of employee benefit plans

members of the bank insurance fund bif  by contrast  pay  in addition to their normal deposit insurance premium  approximately cents per of domestic deposits 
under the act  the fdic also is not permitted to establish saif assessment rates that are lower than comparable bif assessment rates 
beginning no later than january   the rate paid to retire the fico bonds will be equal for members of the bif and the saif 
the act also provides for the merging of the bif and the saif by january  provided there are no financial institutions still chartered as savings associations at that time 
should the insurance funds be merged before january   the rate paid by all members of this new fund to retire the fico bonds would be equal 
regulatory capital requirements 
ots capital regulations require savings associations to meet three capital standards tangible capital equal to of total adjusted assets  leverage capital core capital equal to of total adjusted assets  and risk based capital equal to of total risk based assets 
the bank must meet each of these standards in order to be deemed in compliance with ots capital requirements 
in addition  the ots may require a savings association to maintain capital above the minimum capital levels 
the ots has proposed to amend its leverage capital requirements 
under the proposed regulation  a savings association which is assigned a composite rating of under the uniform financial institutions rating system  would be required to maintain a minimum leverage capital ratio equal to of total adjusted assets 
all other savings associations would be required to maintain a minimum leverage capital ratio equal to of total adjusted assets 
under ots regulations  a savings association with a greater than normal level of interest rate exposure must deduct an interest rate risk irr component in calculating its total capital for purposes of determining whether it meets its risk based capital requirement 
interest rate exposure is measured  generally  as the decline in an institution s net portfolio value that would result from a basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates whichever would result in a lower net portfolio value  divided by the estimated economic value of the savings association s assets 
the interest rate risk component to be deducted from total capital is equal to one half of the difference between an institution s measured exposure and normal irr exposure which is defined as  multiplied by the estimated economic value of the institution s assets 
in august  the ots indicated that it intends to delay implementation of its automatic capital deduction for interest rate risk pending the testing of an ots appeals process and to provide an opportunity to assess any further guidance from the other three federal banking agencies regarding their planned implementation of a capital deduction 
this delay is still in effect and  based on the bank s asset liability structure  the bank would not have been subject to an irr capital requirement at december  these capital requirements are viewed as minimum standards by the ots  and most institutions are expected to maintain capital levels well above the minimum 
in addition  the ots regulations provide that minimum capital levels higher than those provided in the regulations may be established by the ots for individual savings associations  upon a determination that the savings association s capital is or may become inadequate in view of its circumstances 
the ots regulations provide that higher individual minimum regulatory capital requirements may be appropriate in circumstances where  among others a savings association has a high degree of exposure to interest rate risk  prepayment risk  credit risk  concentration of credit risk  certain risks arising from nontraditional activities or similar risks or a high proportion of off balance sheet risk  a savings association is growing  either internally or through acquisitions  at such a rate that supervisory problems are presented that are not dealt with adequately by ots regulations  and a savings association may be adversely affected by activities or condition of its holding company  affiliates  subsidiaries or other persons with which it has significant business relationships 
the bank is not subject to any such individual minimum regulatory capital requirement 
as shown in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition regulatory capital compliance on page the bank s regulatory capital exceeded all minimum regulatory capital requirements as of december  hola permits savings associations not in compliance with the ots capital standards to seek an exemption from certain penalties or sanctions for noncompliance 
such an exemption will be granted only if certain strict requirements are met  and must be denied under certain circumstances 
if an exemption is granted by the ots  the savings association still may be subject to enforcement actions for other violations of law or unsafe or unsound practices or conditions 
prompt corrective action 
the prompt corrective action regulations adopted by the ots require certain mandatory actions and authorize certain other discretionary actions to be taken by the ots against a savings association that falls within certain undercapitalized capital categories specified in the regulation 
the regulations establish five categories of capital classification well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
under the regulations  an institution s risk based capital  leverage capital and tangible capital ratios are used to determine the institution s capital classification 
at december   the bank exceeded the capital requirements of a well capitalized institution under applicable ots regulations 
in general  the prompt corrective action regulations prohibit an insured depository institution from declaring any dividends  making any other capital distribution or paying a management fee to a controlling person if  following the distribution or payment  the institution would be within any of the three undercapitalized categories 
in addition  adequately capitalized institutions may accept brokered deposits as defined only with a waiver from the fdic and are subject to restrictions on the interest rates that can be paid on such deposits 
undercapitalized institutions may not accept  renew or rollover brokered deposits 
if the ots determines that an institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition  or if the institution is deemed to be engaging in an unsafe and unsound practice  the ots may  if the institution is well capitalized  reclassify it as adequately capitalized  if the institution is adequately capitalized but not well capitalized  require it to comply with restrictions applicable to undercapitalized institutions  and  if the institution is undercapitalized  require it to comply with certain restrictions applicable to significantly undercapitalized institutions 
loans to one borrower 
savings associations generally are subject to the lending limits applicable to national banks 
with certain limited exceptions  the maximum amount that a savings association or a national bank may lend to any borrower including certain related entities of the borrower at one time may not exceed of the unimpaired capital and surplus of the institution  plus an additional of unimpaired capital and surplus for loans fully secured by readily marketable collateral 
savings associations are additionally authorized to make loans to one borrower  for any purpose  in an amount not to exceed  or  by order of the director of ots  in an amount not to exceed the lesser of  or of unimpaired capital and surplus to develop residential housing  provided i the purchase price of each single family dwelling in the development does not exceed  ii the savings association is in compliance with its fully phased in capital requirements  iii the loans comply with applicable loan to value requirements  and iv the aggregate amount of loans made under this authority does not exceed of unimpaired capital and surplus 
at december   the bank s loans to one borrower limit was million based upon the of unimpaired capital and surplus measurement 
qualified thrift lender test 
savings associations must meet a qtl test  which test may be met either by maintaining a specified level of assets in qualified thrift investments as specified in hola or by meeting the definition of a domestic building and loan association in section of the code 
if the bank maintains an appropriate level of certain specified investments primarily residential mortgages and related investments  including certain mortgage related securities and otherwise qualifies as a qtl or a domestic building and loan association  it will continue to enjoy full borrowing privileges from the fhlb 
the required percentage of investments under hola is of assets while the code requires investments of of assets 
an association must be in compliance with the qtl test or the definition of domestic building and loan association on a monthly basis in nine out of every months 
associations that fail to meet the qtl test will generally be prohibited from engaging in any activity not permitted for both a national bank and a savings association 
as of december   the bank was in compliance with its qtl requirement and met the definition of a domestic building and loan association 
affiliate transactions 
transactions between a savings association and its affiliates are subject to quantitative and qualitative restrictions under sections a and b of the federal reserve act 
affiliates of a savings association include  among other entities  the savings association s holding company and companies that are under common control with the savings association 
in general  sections a and b and ots regulations issued in connection therewith limit the extent to which a savings association or its subsidiaries may engage in certain covered transactions with affiliates to an amount equal to of the association s capital and surplus  in the case of covered transactions with any one affiliate  and to an amount equal to of such capital and surplus  in the case of covered transactions with all affiliates 
in addition  a savings association and its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions and certain other transactions only on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same  or at least as favorable to the savings association or its subsidiary  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies 
a covered transaction is defined to include a loan or extension of credit to an affiliate  a purchase of investment securities issued by an affiliate  a purchase of assets from an affiliate  with certain exceptions  the acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate as collateral for a loan or extension of credit to any party  or the issuance of a guarantee  acceptance  or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate 
in addition  under the ots regulations  a savings association may not make a loan or extension of credit to an affiliate unless the affiliate is engaged only in activities permissible for bank holding companies  a savings association may not purchase or invest in securities of an affiliate other than shares of a subsidiary  a savings association and its subsidiaries may not purchase a low quality asset from an affiliate  and covered transactions and certain other transactions between a savings association or its subsidiaries and an affiliate must be on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices 
with certain exceptions  each loan or extension of credit by a savings association to an affiliate must be secured by collateral with a market value ranging from to depending on the type of collateral of the amount of the loan or extension of credit 
the ots regulation generally excludes all non bank and non savings association subsidiaries of savings associations from treatment as affiliates  except to the extent that the ots or the federal reserve board decides to treat such subsidiaries as affiliates 
the regulation also requires savings associations to make and retain records that reflect affiliate transactions in reasonable detail  and provides that certain classes of savings associations may be required to give the ots prior notice of affiliate transactions 
capital distribution limitations 
ots regulations impose limitations upon all capital distributions by savings associations  such as cash dividends  payments to repurchase or otherwise acquire its shares  payments to shareholders of another institution in a cash out merger and other distributions charged against capital 
in general  the bank may not declare or pay a cash dividend on its capital stock if the effect thereof would cause the bank to fail to meet one of its regulatory capital requirements 
under the regulation  an association that meets its capital requirements both before and after a proposed distribution and has not been notified by the ots that it is in need of more than normal supervision a tier association may  after prior notice to but without the approval of the ots  make capital distributions during a calendar year up to the higher of i of its net income to date during the calendar year plus the amount that would reduce by one half its surplus capital ratio at the beginning of the calendar year  or ii of its net income over the most recent four quarter period 
a tier association may make capital distributions in excess of the above amount if it gives notice to the ots and the ots does not object to the distribution 
a savings association that meets its regulatory capital requirements both before and after a proposed distribution but does not meet its capital requirement a tier association is authorized  after prior notice to the ots but without ots approval  to make capital distributions in an amount up to of its net income over the most recent four quarter period  taking into account all prior distributions during the same period 
any distribution in excess of this amount must be approved in advance by the ots 
a savings association that does not meet its current regulatory capital requirements a tier association cannot make any capital distribution without prior approval from the ots  unless the capital distribution is consistent with the terms of a capital plan approved by the ots 
at december   the bank qualified as a tier association for purposes of the capital distribution rule 
the ots may prohibit a proposed capital distribution that would otherwise be permitted if the ots determines that the distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 
the ots has proposed to amend its capital distribution regulation to conform its requirements to the ots prompt corrective action regulation 
under the proposed regulation  an institution that would remain at least adequately capitalized after making a capital distribution  and was not owned by a holding company  would no longer be required to provide notice to the ots prior to making a capital distribution 
troubled associations and undercapitalized associations would be allowed to make capital distributions only by filing an application and receiving ots approval  and such applications would be approved under certain limited circumstances 
activities of subsidiaries 
a savings association seeking to establish a new subsidiary  acquire control of an existing company or conduct a new activity through a subsidiary must provide days prior notice to the fdic and the ots and conduct any activities of the subsidiary in accordance with regulations and orders of the ots 
the ots has the power to require a savings association to divest any subsidiary or terminate any activity conducted by a subsidiary that the ots determines to pose a serious threat to the financial safety  soundness or stability of the savings association or to be otherwise inconsistent with sound banking practices 
community reinvestment act and the fair lending laws 
savings associations have a responsibility under cra and related regulations of the ots to help meet the credit needs of their communities  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
in addition  the equal credit opportunity act and the fair housing act together  the fair lending laws prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes 
an institution s failure to comply with the provisions of cra could  at a minimum  result in regulatory restrictions on its activities and the denial of certain applications  and failure to comply with the fair lending laws could result in enforcement actions by the ots  as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the department of justice 
federal home loan bank system 
the bank is a member of the fhlb system 
among other benefits  each fhlb serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region 
each fhlb is financed primarily from the sale of consolidated obligations of the fhlb system 
each fhlb makes available to members loans ie  advances in accordance with the policies and procedures established by the board of directors of the individual fhlb 
as a member  the bank is required to own capital stock in an fhlb in an amount equal to the greater of i of its aggregate outstanding principal amount of its residential mortgage loans  home purchase contracts and similar obligations at the beginning of each calendar year  ii of total assets  or iii of its fhlb advances borrowings 
at december   the bank had million in fhlb stock 
the bank s required investment in fhlb stock  based on december  financial data  was million 
the bank received a million stock dividend and purchased additional stock amounting to million in the first quarter of  thereby increasing the bank s investment to the required amount 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements on page liquidity requirements 
under ots regulations  a savings association is required to maintain an average daily balance of liquid assets including cash  certain time deposits and savings accounts  bankers acceptances  certain government obligations  and certain other investments in each calendar quarter of not less than of either i its liquidity base consisting of certain net withdrawable accounts plus short term borrowings as of the end of the preceding calendar quarter  or ii the average daily balance of its liquidity base during the preceding quarter 
this liquidity requirement may be changed from time to time by the ots to any amount between and  depending upon certain factors  including economic conditions and savings flows of all savings associations 
the bank maintains liquid assets in compliance with these regulations 
monetary penalties may be imposed upon an institution for violations of liquidity requirements 
federal reserve system 
the federal reserve board requires all depository institutions to maintain non interest bearing reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts primarily checking  now  and super now checking accounts and non personal time deposits 
the balances maintained to meet the reserve requirements imposed by the federal reserve board may be used to satisfy the liquidity requirements that are imposed by the ots 
at december   the bank was in compliance with these requirements 
recent proposed legislation 
congress has been considering legislation in various forms that would require federal thrifts  such as the bank  to convert their charters to national or state bank charters 
the treasury department has been studying the development of a common charter for federal savings associations and commercial banks 
in the event that the thrift charter is eliminated by january   the act would require the merger of the bif and the saif into a single deposit insurance fund on that date 
in the absence of appropriate grandfather provisions  legislation eliminating the thrift charter could have a material adverse effect on the bank and downey because  among other things  the regulatory  capital and accounting treatment for national and state banks and savings associations differs in certain significant respects 
downey cannot determine whether  or in what form  such legislation may eventually be enacted and there can be no assurance that any legislation that is enacted would contain adequate grandfather rights for the bank and downey 
taxation federal 
a savings institution generally is subject to tax in the same manner as other corporations for federal income tax purposes  though savings institutions have historically enjoyed favorable treatment under the code in determining the deduction allowed for bad debts 
during  however  congress enacted legislation which repealed the reserve method of determining bad debt deductions for large thrift institutions ie  thrifts with assets greater than million  subjecting savings associations to rules similar to those currently applicable to large commercial banks 
the repeal was effective for tax years beginning after bad debt reserves accumulated since were subject to recapture as taxable income over a six year period beginning in however  thrifts were allowed to defer recapture for up to two years if the amount of mortgage loans originated in and equaled or exceeded the average amount of mortgages originated in the six years prior to based upon originations in and  the bank qualifies for the two year deferral under this originations test  and thus will recapture its post bad debt reserve over a six year period beginning in the bad debt deductions for and were determined under the specific charge off method  which allows a tax deduction for loans determined to be wholly or partially worthless 
prior to  a savings institution which met certain definitional tests relating to the composition of its assets and the sources of its income a qualifying savings institution was permitted to take deductions for additions to reserves for bad debts  rather than recognizing deductions for specific loans as they became worthless 
a qualifying savings institution was allowed to make annual additions to such reserves based upon the institution s actual loan loss experience the experience method 
alternatively  a qualifying savings institution could elect to compute the allowable addition to its bad debt reserve for qualifying real property loans generally  loans secured by an interest in improved real estate as a percentage of the institution s taxable income the percentage of taxable income method 
under applicable provisions of the code  a savings institution organized in stock form whose accumulated reserve for losses on qualifying real property loans exceeds the reserve as calculated under the experience method may be subject to recapture taxes on such reserve if it makes certain types of distributions to its stockholders 
dividends may be paid out of retained earnings without the imposition of any tax on the savings institution to the extent that the amounts paid as dividends do not exceed the savings institution s current or post accumulated earnings and profits as calculated for federal income tax purposes 
stock redemptions  dividends paid in excess of the savings institution s current or post accumulated earnings and profits as calculated for tax purposes  and other distributions made with respect to the savings institution s stock and the taxes deemed to be attributable thereto  however  are deemed under applicable sections of the code to be made from the savings institution s tax bad debt reserves to the extent that such reserves exceed the amount that could have been accumulated under the experience method 
thus  certain distributions to stockholders that are treated as having been paid from the reserve for losses on qualifying real property loans could result in a federal recapture tax 
the bank  however  has not in the past made distributions that resulted in federal recapture tax under these rules and does not expect to make any such distributions in the foreseeable future 
in addition to the regular corporate income tax  corporations  including qualifying savings institutions  are subject to an alternative minimum tax 
this tax is computed with respect to the corporation s regular taxable income with certain adjustments  as increased by tax preference items alternative minimum taxable income and will apply to the extent that it exceeds the corporation s regular tax liability 
in addition  in computing a corporation s alternative minimum taxable income  the corporation s regular taxable income is required to be increased by of the excess of the corporation s current earnings and profits subject to certain adjustments over the corporation s alternative minimum taxable income determined prior to this adjustment and without regard to the alternative tax net operating loss deduction 
a corporation that incurs alternative minimum tax generally is entitled to take such tax as a credit against its regular tax in subsequent years to the extent that the corporation s regular tax liability in such subsequent years reduced by certain other tax credits exceeds the corporation s so called tentative minimum tax generally  an amount computed by multiplying the corporation s alternative minimum taxable income for the year by the then applicable rate for the alternative minimum tax 
state 
the california franchise tax applicable to the bank is computed under a formula which results in a rate higher than the rate applicable to non financial corporations because it reflects an amount in lieu of local personal property and business license taxes paid by such corporations but not generally paid by banks or financial corporations such as the bank 
the variable tax rate was in  and for downey and its wholly owned subsidiaries file a california franchise tax return on a combined reporting basis 
additional state income tax returns are filed on a separate entity basis in arizona  colorado  and illinois for income producing property owned in those states 
downey s federal income and state franchise tax returns have been audited by the internal revenue service and the california franchise tax board  respectively  for all years through federal tax returns for years through are currently under examination 
state franchise tax returns for years subsequent to remain open to review 
factors that may affect future results the following discusses certain factors which may affect downey s financial results and operations and should be considered in evaluating downey 
economic conditions and geographic concentrations 
downey is headquartered in southern california  and its operations are concentrated in southern and northern california 
as a result of this geographic concentration  downey s results depend largely upon economic conditions in these areas 
while the california economy has exhibited positive economic and employment trends  there is no assurance that such trends will continue 
a deterioration in economic conditions could have a material adverse impact on the quality of downey s loan portfolio and the demand for its products and services 
interest rates 
downey anticipates that interest rate levels will remain generally constant in  but if interest rates vary substantially from present levels  downey s results may differ materially from the results currently anticipated 
changes in interest rates will influence the growth of loans  investments and deposits and affect the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits 
government regulation and monetary policy 
the financial services industry is subject to extensive federal and state supervision and regulation 
significant new laws or changes in  or repeals of  existing laws may cause downey s results to differ materially 
further  federal monetary policy  particularly as implemented through the federal reserve system  significantly affects credit conditions for downey  primarily through open market operations in united states government securities  the discount rate for borrowings and reserve requirements  and a material change in these conditions would be likely to have a material impact on downey s results 
competition 
the banking and financial services business in downey s market areas are highly competitive 
the increasingly competitive environment is a result primarily of changes in regulation  changes in technology and product delivery systems  and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers 
downey s results may differ if circumstances affecting the nature or level of competition change 
credit quality 
a significant source of risk arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained because borrowers  guarantors and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans 
downey has adopted underwriting and loan monitoring procedures and credit policies  including the establishment and review of the allowance for loan losses  that management believes are appropriate to minimize this risk by assessing the likelihood of nonperformance  tracking loan performance and diversifying downey s loan portfolio 
such policies and procedures  however  may not prevent unexpected losses that could materially adversely affect downey s results 
year like most financial organizations  downey has many computer systems that identify dates using only the last two digits of the year 
these systems must be prepared to distinguish dates such as from computer system failures due to processing errors potentially arising from calculations using year dates are a known risk 
downey has established processes to identify  prioritize  renovate or replace systems that may be affected by year dates 
to date  downey has completed an inventory of all systems and determined which processes are most critical to supporting customer transaction processing and providing customer services 
system renovation and replacement plans have been started and are targeted for completion by the end of  with compliance testing and installation processes to be completed during however  third party vendor dependency  including government entities  may impact downey s efforts to successfully complete year compliance for all systems in a timely fashion

adjusted for a stock dividend paid in may item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain statements under this caption constitute forward looking statements under the reform act which involve risks and uncertainties 
downey s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include but are not limited to economic conditions  competition in the geographic and business areas in which downey conducts its operations  fluctuations in interest rates  credit quality and government regulation 
for additional information concerning these factors  see item business factors that may affect future results on page overview net income for totaled million or per share on a diluted basis  more than double last year s million or per share 
the results included a one time assessment to recapitalize the savings association insurance fund saif which totaled million million or per share on an after tax basis 
excluding that assessment  net income in would have been million or above a year ago 
excluding the one time saif assessment  the increase in net income primarily reflected higher net interest income 
net interest income increased million or due to higher average earning assets 
also contributing to the increase in net income between years was a million increase in other income and a million decline in the net expense associated with the operation of real estate acquired in settlement of loans 
the increase in other income reflected several factors 
favorably impacting other income were increases of million in income from real estate held for investment  million in the all other category of other income representing a gain from the sale of an asset obtained as part of the acquisition of butterfield savings  million in loan and deposit related fees and million in net gains from sales of loans and mortgage backed securities 
these favorable other income items were partially offset by a decline of million in net gains from sales of investment securities 
the favorable impact of higher net interest and other income  and lower net expense associated with the operation of real estate acquired in settlement of loans was partially offset by an increase of million in general and administrative expense 
the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily associated with branch expansion  particularly into in store banking  higher advertising expenditures and growth in auto lending 
assets increased million or during to billion at year end  following an increase during single family loan originations increased from billion in to billion in of the amount  million represented higher yielding subprime loans 
in addition to single family loans  million of other loans were originated  including million of auto loans and million of construction loans 
asset growth was primarily funded with deposits as deposits increased million or to billion at december  of the increase  million was generated by new branches opened in non performing assets totaled million or of assets at december   down from million or of assets at december  the decline in non performing assets was spread throughout most categories 
a detailed review of all criticized  classified  watch and non performing assets is performed at least semi annually 
all assets greater than million are reviewed annually 
the combined provisions for loan and real estate losses  including real estate held for investment and acquired in settlement of loans  totaled million for  compared to million in and million in at december   the bank met and exceeded all three regulatory capital tests  with capital to asset ratios of in tangible and core capital and in risk based capital 
these capital levels are well above the well capitalized standards defined by the federal banking regulators of for core and tangible capital and for risk based capital 
for further information  see business regulation regulation of the bank insurance of deposit accounts on page  financial condition investments in real estate and joint ventures on page and regulatory capital compliance on page results of operations net interest income net interest income is the difference between the interest and dividends earned on loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities interest earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is affected principally by the spread between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities and by the relative dollar amounts of such assets and liabilities 
net interest income was million in  up million or from and million or greater than the improvement over primarily reflected a increase in average earning assets to billion 
in addition  benefited from approximately million of higher than usual distributions from agreements in which downey shares in the net cash flows of certain shopping centers which downey currently  or in the past  financed 
these favorable items were partially offset by a decline in the effective interest rate spread 
the effective interest rate spread averaged in  down from in but up from in between and  the yield on earning assets increased basis points  while the cost of funding those earnings assets increased basis points 
the more rapid increase in funding costs occurred as the growth in earning assets was primarily funded with higher cost certificates of deposit and borrowings 
the following table presents for the periods indicated the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest earning assets and resultant yields  the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities and the resultant costs  expressed both in dollars and rates 
the table also sets forth the net earning balance the difference between the average balance of interest earning assets and the average balance of interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated 
non accrual loans are included in the average interest earning assets balance 
interest from non accrual loans is included in interest income only to the extent that payments were received and to the extent that downey believes it will recover the remaining principal balance of the loan 
average balances are computed using a monthly average balance during the period 
the effective interest rate spread  which reflects a savings association s relative level of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities  equals i the difference between interest income on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  ii divided by average interest earning assets for the period

in its joint ventures  dsl service company is entitled to interest on its equity invested in the project on a priority basis after third party debt  and shares profits and losses with the developer partner  generally on an equal basis 
dsl service company has obtained personal guarantees from the principals of the developer partners in a number of the joint ventures and generally requires the developer partner to secure any outstanding obligations to the joint venture  such as its portion of operating losses  when the partner is unable to satisfy such obligations on a current basis 
partnership equity deficit accounts are affected by current period results of operations  additional partner advances  partnership distributions and partnership liquidations

four of these partners were operators of eight retail neighborhood shopping centers  a commercial building  a residential housing development and vacant land held for sale 
the fifth partner is involved in the rehabilitation of an apartment complex 
dsl service company has ten wholly owned retail neighborhood shopping centers located in california and arizona 
the following table sets forth the condensed balance sheets of dsl service company s joint ventures by property type at december   on a historical cost basis 
included in the following condensed balance sheet are allowances for losses recorded by dsl service company 
these allowances are determined quarterly by means of downey s internal asset review process 
see problem loans and real estate allowance for losses on loans and real estate on page to the extent the fair market value of the real estate assets is less than the carrying value  then a provision is made to create a valuation allowance for the difference 
if such a valuation allowance is needed  it is reflected in the investment accounts for the joint ventures on dsl service company s books 
not all of the joint venture investments have valuation allowances as the fair market value of the associated property exceeds its carrying value

the aggregate other partners deficit of million represents their equity interest in the accumulated retained earnings deficit of the respective joint ventures 
those results include not only the net profit on sales and the operating results of the real estate assets  but depreciation expense and funding costs as well 
except for any secured financing which has been obtained  dsl service company has provided all other financing 
as part of downey s internal asset review process  the fair value of the joint venture real estate assets is compared to the secured notes payable to the bank and others and dsl service company s equity investment 
to the extent the fair value of the real estate assets is less than the aggregate of those amounts  a provision is made to create a valuation allowance 
those allowances totaled million at december  at december   the fair value of the real estate assets of certain joint venture partnerships in which the other partners equity was a deficit exceeded the amount of third party notes and dsl service company s investment thereby eliminating the need for a valuation allowance since the sale of the real estate would allow dsl service company to realize its investment 
thus  the other partners deficit of million exceeds the amount of valuation allowances established of million

downey s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk in its lending and deposit taking activities 
this interest rate risk occurs to the degree that interest bearing liabilities reprice or mature more rapidly or on a different basis than interest earning assets 
since downey s earnings depend primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between the interest and dividends earned on interest earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  a principal objective of downey is to actively monitor and manage the effects of adverse changes in interest rates on net interest income while maintaining asset quality 
downey s asset liability management committee alco is responsible for implementing the interest rate risk management policy which sets forth limits established by the board of directors on acceptable changes in net interest income and net portfolio value npv from specified changes in interest rates 
npv is defined by the ots as the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets minus the present value of expected net cash flows from existing liabilities plus the present value of expected cash flows from existing off balance sheet contracts 
alco reviews  among other items  economic conditions  the interest rate outlook  the demand for loans  the availability of deposits and borrowings  and downey s current operating results  liquidity  capital and interest rate exposure 
in addition  alco monitors asset and liability maturities and repricing characteristics on a regular basis and performs various simulations and other analyzes to determine the potential impact of various business strategies in controlling interest rate risk and the potential impact of those strategies upon future earnings under various interest rate scenarios 
based on such reviews  alco formulates a strategy that is intended to implement the objectives set forth in downey s business plan without exceeding the net interest income and npv limits set forth in the interest rate risk policy 
one measure of downey s exposure to differential changes in interest rates between assets and liabilities is shown in the following table which sets forth the repricing frequency of downey s major asset and liability categories as of december   as well as certain information regarding the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in future periods 
the repricing frequencies have been determined by reference to projected maturities  based upon contractual maturities as adjusted for scheduled repayments and repricing mechanisms provisions for changes in the interest and dividend rates of assets and liabilities 
prepayment rates are assumed  in each period  on substantially all of downey s loan portfolio based upon its historical loan prepayment experience and anticipated future prepayments 
repricing mechanisms on certain of downey s assets are subject to limitations  such as caps on the amount that interest rates and payments on downey s loans may adjust  and accordingly  such assets do not normally respond as completely or rapidly as downey s liabilities to changes in market interest rates 
the interest rate sensitivity of downey s assets and liabilities illustrated in the following table would vary substantially if different assumptions were used or if actual experience differed from the assumptions set forth

downey s six month gap at december   was a positive ie  more interest earning assets reprice within six months than interest bearing liabilities 
this compares to a positive six month gap of and at december  and  respectively 
downey s primary strategy to manage interest rate risk is to emphasize the origination of arms or loans with relatively short maturities 
interest rates on arms are primarily tied to the cmt or cofi 
during  and  downey originated and purchased approximately billion  billion and billion  respectively  of loans and mortgage backed securities with adjustable interest rates or maturities of five years or less  representing approximately  and  respectively  of all loans and mortgage backed securities originated and purchased for investment during such periods 
arm originations during those three years were primarily tied to cofi rather than the cmt index 
at december   of downey s interest earning assets mature  reprice or are estimated to prepay within five years  compared to and at december  and  respectively 
at december   loans with adjustable interest rates represented of downey s loan and mortgage backed securities portfolio 
during  downey will continue to offer residential fixed rate loan products to its customers to meet customer demand 
fixed rate loans are primarily originated for sale in the secondary market and are priced accordingly in order to create loan servicing income and to increase opportunities for originating arms 
however  downey occasionally originates for its own portfolio fixed rate loans to facilitate the sale of real estate acquired through foreclosure or that meet certain yield and other approved guidelines 
see business lending activities secondary marketing and loan servicing activities on page downey is better protected against rising interest rates with a positive six month gap 
however  downey remains subject to possible interest rate spread compression  which would adversely impact downey s net interest income if interest rates rise 
this is primarily due to the lag in the repricing of the indices to which downey s adjustable rate loans and mortgage backed securities are tied  as well as the repricing frequencies and periodic interest rate caps on such adjustable rate loans and mortgage backed securities 
the amount of such interest rate spread compression would depend upon the frequency and severity of such interest rate fluctuations 
the positive six month gap could decrease in future periods due to  among other things  the continued expansion of the auto and consumer loan portfolios 
in addition to measuring interest rate risk via a gap analysis  downey establishes limits on  and measures the sensitivity of  its net interest income and npv to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates are defined as instantaneous and sustained movements in interest rates in basis point increments 
downey utilizes an internally maintained asset liability management simulation model to make the calculations which  for npv  is calculated on a discounted cash flow basis 
first  downey estimates its net interest income for the next twelve months and the current npv assuming no change in interest rates from those at period end 
once the base case has been estimated  calculations are made for each of the defined changes in interest rates  to include any associated differences in the anticipated prepayment speed of loans 
those results are then compared against the base case to determine the estimated change to net interest income and npv due to the changes in interest rates 
following are the estimated impacts to net interest income and npv from various instantaneous  parallel shifts in interest rates based upon downey s asset and liability structure as of december  since these estimates are based upon numerous assumptions  such as the expected maturities of downey s interest bearing assets and liabilities and the shape of the period end interest rate yield curve  downey s actual sensitivity to interest rate changes could vary significantly if actual experience differs from those assumptions used in making the calculations 
percentage change in change in interest rates net interest net portfolio in basis points income value the percentage change in this column represents net interest income for months in a stable interest rate environment versus the net interest income in the various rate scenarios 
the percentage change in this column represents the npv of the bank in a stable interest rate environment versus the npv in the various rate scenarios 
the following table shows downey s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  categorized by expected maturity  and the instruments fair values at december  this data differs from that in the gap table as it does not incorporate the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
rather  it only reflects contractural maturities adjusted for anticipated prepayments

total interest sensitive liabilities         expected maturities are contractual maturities adjusted for prepayments of principal 
downey uses certain assumptions to estimate fair values and expected maturities

the prepayment experience reflected herein is based on downey s historical experience 
downey s average constant prepayment rate cpr is and on its fixed rate and arm portfolios  respectively  for interest earning assets excluding investment securities  which do not have prepayment features 
for deposit liabilities  in accordance with standard industry practice and downey s own historical experience  decay factors  used to estimate deposit runoff  of cpr per year have been applied 
the actual maturities of these instruments could vary substantially if future prepayments differ from the downey s historical experience

problem loans and real estate non performing assets non performing assets consist of loans on which downey has ceased the accrual of interest non accrual loans and real estate acquired in settlement of loans 
non performing assets totaled million at december   compared to million at december   and million at december  the decline in non performing assets was spread throughout all categories and is primarily attributed to the improving california economy 
of the total  real estate acquired in settlement of loans  net of allowances  represented million at december   compared to million at december   and million at december  the decrease reflects a reduction in the single family inventory and the sale of a shopping center taken in satisfaction of a loan

all such assets were sold to the fdic s division of resolution in december allowance for loan losses does not include the allowance for real estate and real estate acquired in settlement of loans 
when resolving problem loans  it is downey s policy to determine collectibility under various circumstances which will result in maximum financial benefit to downey 
it is also downey s policy to take appropriate  timely and aggressive action when necessary to resolve non performing assets 
this is accomplished by either working with the borrower to bring the loan current or by foreclosing and selling the asset 
downey performs ongoing reviews of loans that display weaknesses and maintains adequate loss allowances on the loans 
for a discussion on downey s internal asset review policy  refer to allowance for losses on loans and real estate on page all of downey s non performing assets at december   were located in california  with the exception of one property acquired in settlement of loans located in arizona 
downey evaluates the need for appraisals for non performing assets on a periodic basis 
a new appraisal will generally be obtained when downey believes that there may have been an adverse change in the property operations or in the economic conditions of the geographic market of the property securing its loans 
downey s policy is to obtain new appraisals at least annually for major real estate acquired in settlement of loans 
throughout  downey obtained new appraisals for non performing loans and real estate acquired in settlement of loans 
non accrual loans 
it is downey s general policy to account for a loan as non accrual when the loan becomes days delinquent or when collection of interest appears doubtful 
in certain cases  loans may remain on accrual status past days when it is determined that continued accrual is warranted because the loan is well secured and in process of collection 
as of december   downey had no loans days or more delinquent which remained on accrual status 
any interest previously accrued with respect to non accrual loans is reversed and charged against interest income 
interest income is recognized on non accrual loans to the extent that payments are received and to the extent that downey believes it will recover the remaining principal balance of the loan 
such loans are restored to an accrual status only if all past due payments are made by the borrower and the borrower has demonstrated the ability to make future payments of principal and interest 
at december   non accrual loans aggregating million were less than days delinquent relative to their contractual terms 
additional loans aggregating million were not contractually past due  but were deemed non accrual due to management s assessment of the borrower s ability to pay 
impaired loans 
impaired loans are carried on downey s accounting records at either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  or at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral securing the loan 
impaired loans exclude large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment 
for downey  loans collectively reviewed for impairment include all single family loans and performing multi family and non residential loans having principal balances of less than million 
downey considers a loan to be impaired when  based upon current information and events  it believes it is probable that downey will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
in determining impairment  downey considers large non homogeneous loans with the following characteristics non accrual loans  debt restructurings  and performing loans which exhibit  among other characteristics  high loan to value ratios or delinquent taxes 
downey bases the measurement of collateral dependent impaired loans on the fair value of the loan s collateral 
non collateral dependent loans are valued based on a present value calculation of expected future cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective rate 
cash receipts on impaired loans not performing according to contractual terms are generally used to reduce the carrying value of the loan  unless downey believes it will recover the remaining principal balance of the loan 
impairment losses are included in the allowance for loan losses through a charge to provision for loan losses 
adjustments to impairment losses due to changes in the fair value of the collateral of impaired loans are included in provision for loan losses 
upon disposition of an impaired loan  loss of principal is recorded through a charge off to the allowance for loan losses 
at december   the recorded investment in loans for which impairment has been recognized totaled million  compared to million at december  all of which were on non accrual status 
the total allowance for losses related to such loans was million at december   and million at december  for further information regarding impaired loans  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements on page troubled debt restructurings 
a restructuring of a debt is considered a troubled debt restructuring when downey  for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties  grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise grant 
troubled debt restructurings may include changing repayment terms  reducing the stated interest rate and reducing the amounts of principal and or interest due or extending the maturity date 
the restructuring of a loan is intended to recover as much of downey s investment as possible and to achieve the highest yield possible 
there were no troubled debt restructurings on accrual status at december  and real estate acquired in settlement of loans 
real estate acquired in settlement of loans consists of real estate acquired through foreclosure or deeds in lieu of foreclosure 
delinquent loans when a borrower fails to make required payments on a loan and does not cure the delinquency within days  downey normally records a notice of default  subject to any required prior notice to the borrower  and commences foreclosure proceedings 
if the loan is not reinstated within the time permitted by law for reinstatement  which is normally five business days prior to the date set for the non judicial trustee s sale  the property may then be sold at a foreclosure sale 
if downey has elected to pursue a non judicial foreclosure  downey is not permitted under applicable california law to obtain a deficiency judgment against the borrower  even if the security property is insufficient to cover the balance owed 
in foreclosure sales  downey generally acquires title to the property

downey commenced one to four subprime lending in the first quarter of allowance for losses on loans and real estate valuation allowances for losses on loans and real estate are established on a specific and general basis 
specific allowances are determined based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its fair value 
general valuation allowances are determined based on historical loss experience  current and anticipated levels and trends of delinquent and non performing loans and the economic environment in downey s market areas 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements on page downey s internal asset review department conducts independent reviews to evaluate the risk and quality of all downey assets 
downey s internal asset review committee iarc is responsible for the review and classification of assets 
the iarc members include the chief internal asset review officer  chief executive officer  chief financial officer  chief lending officer  general counsel  director of compliance risk management  credit administrator and chief appraiser 
the iarc meets quarterly to review and to determine asset classifications and to recommend any changes to asset valuation allowances 
with the exception of payoffs or asset sales  the classification of an asset  once established  can be removed or upgraded only upon approval of the iarc 
the chief internal asset review officer reports quarterly to the audit committee of the board of directors regarding overall asset quality  the adequacy of valuation allowances on classified assets and downey s adherence to policies and procedures regarding asset classification and valuation 
downey adheres to an internal asset review system and loss allowance methodology designed to provide for timely recognition of problem assets and adequate general valuation allowances to cover asset losses 
downey s current asset monitoring process includes the use of asset classifications to segregate the assets  largely loans and real estate  into various risk categories 
downey uses the various asset classifications as a means of measuring risk for determining the general valuation allowances at a point in time 
downey currently uses a six grade system to classify its assets 
the current grades are pass  watch  special mention  substandard  doubtful and loss 
substandard  doubtful and loss assets are considered classified assets for regulatory purposes 
a brief description of these classifications follows the pass classification represents a level of credit quality which contains no well defined deficiency or weakness 
o the watch classification is used to identify an asset that currently contains no well defined deficiency or weakness  but it is determined to be desirable to closely monitor the asset eg  loans to facilitate the sale of real estate acquired in settlement of loans 
this category may also be used for assets upgraded from lower classifications where continuing monitoring is deemed appropriate 
o a special mention asset does not currently expose downey to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant an adverse classification  but does possess a correctable deficiency or potential weakness deserving management s close attention 
o substandard assets have a well defined weakness or weaknesses 
they are characterized by the distinct possibility that downey will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
o an asset classified doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values  highly questionable and improbable 
downey considers doubtful to be a temporary classification until resolution of pending weakness issues enables downey to more clearly define the potential for loss 
o that portion of an asset classified loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that its continuance as an asset  without establishment of a specific valuation allowance  is not warranted 
a loss classification does not mean that an asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value  but rather it is not reasonable to defer writing off or providing for all or a portion of an impaired asset even though partial recovery may be effected in the future 
downey will generally classify as loss the balance of the asset that is greater than the fair value of the asset unless payment from another source can be expected 
therefore  the amount of an asset classified as loss reflects the total of specific valuation allowances established for the particular asset 
specific valuation allowances are not includable in determining the bank s total regulatory capital 
the ots has the authority to require downey to change its asset classifications 
if such a change results in an asset being classified in whole or in part as loss  a specific allowance must be established against the amount so classified or that amount must be charged off 
ots guidelines set forth quantitative benchmarks as a starting point for the determination of appropriate levels of general valuation allowances 
the ots directs its examiners to rely on management s estimates of adequate general valuation allowances if the association s process for determining adequate allowances is deemed to be sound 
it is downey s policy to provide an allowance for losses on loans and real estate when it is probable that the value of the asset has been impaired and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
to comply with this policy  downey has established a monitoring system that requires at least an annual review of all assets in excess of million and a semiannual review of all assets considered adversely classified or criticized 
the monitoring system requires a review of current operating statements  an evaluation of the property s current and past performance  an evaluation of the borrower s ability to repay and the preparation of a discounted cash flow analysis 
based on the results of the review  a new appraisal may be required 
downey s provision for loan losses totaled million in  down million from the provision for loan losses exceeded net loan charge offs by million resulting in an increase in the allowance for loan losses to million at december  this increase reflected the growth in single family residential and automobile loans 
included in the current year end allowance of million was million of general valuation allowances of which million was unallocated to any specific loan category and is maintained due to the uncertain  but improving  economy of california 
a summary of activity in the allowances for loan losses is set forth below for the years indicated

the following table is a summary of the activity of downey s allowance for real estate held for investment and non conforming loans to joint ventures for the years indicated 
the million  million and million provision reductions in  and respectively  were due to a continuing improvement in the real estate market which favorably impacted the valuation of certain neighborhood retail shopping center investments and to a reduction in the investment in certain joint ventures

repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities and deposit inflows and outflows are affected significantly by interest rates  real estate sales activity and general economic conditions 
loan repayments totaled billion for  compared to billion in these repayments were more than offset by new loan originations and purchases for portfolio of billion and billion  respectively 
during  downey experienced a net deposit inflow of million  of which million represented transaction accounts with the balance of the increase in certificates of deposit 
aggregate borrowings decreased million as deposit growth exceeded new loan fundings 
downey expects to meet its funding needs primarily from deposit growth 
if those sources fall short of satisfying ongoing commitments to fund maturing and withdrawable deposits  repay borrowings  fund existing and future loan and other investment commitments  continue branch improvement programs and maintenance of regulatory liquidity requirements  downey will utilize borrowing arrangements with the fhlb and other sources 
at december   downey had commitments to fund loans amounting to million  stand by letters of credit of million  undrawn lines of credit of million and loans in process of million 
downey believes its current sources of funds will enable it to meet these obligations while maintaining its liquidity at appropriate levels 
the principal measure of liquidity in the savings and loan industry is the regulatory ratio of cash and eligible investments to the sum of withdrawable savings and borrowings due within one year 
the minimum liquidity ratio set by federal regulators was reduced in from to

current accounting issue in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas 
sfas establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports issued to shareholders 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
sfas supersedes fasb statement no 
 financial reporting for segments of a business enterprise  but retains the requirement to report information about major customers 
it amends fasb statement no 
 consolidation of all majority owned subsidiaries  to remove the special disclosure requirements for previously unconsolidated subsidiaries 
sfas requires that a public business enterprise report financial and descriptive information about its reportable operating segments 
operating segments are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
generally  financial information is required to be reported on the basis that it is used internally for evaluating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to segments 
sfas requires that a public business enterprise report a measure of segment profit or loss  certain specific revenue and expense items  and segment assets 
it requires reconciliations of total segment revenues  total segment profit or loss  total segment assets  and other amounts disclosed for segments to corresponding amounts in the enterprise s general purpose financial statements 
it requires that all public business enterprises report information about the revenues derived from the enterprise s products or services or groups of similar products and services  about the countries in which the enterprise earns revenues and holds assets  and about major customers regardless of whether that information is used in making operating decisions 
however  sfas does not require an enterprise to report information that is not prepared for internal use if reporting it would be impracticable 
sfas also requires that a public business enterprise report descriptive information about the way that the operating segments were determined  the products and services provided by the operating segments  differences between the measurements used in reporting segment information and those used in the enterprise s general purpose financial statements  and changes in the measurement of segment amounts from period to period 
sfas is effective for financial statements for periods beginning after december  in the initial year of application  comparative information for earlier years is to be restated 
sfas need not be applied to interim financial statements in the initial year of its application  but comparative information for interim periods in the initial year of application is to be reported in financial statements for interim periods in the second year of application 
year like most financial organizations  downey has many computer systems that identify dates using only the last two digits of the year 
these systems must be prepared to distinguish dates such as from computer system failures due to processing errors potentially arising from calculations using year dates are a known risk 
downey has established processes to identify  prioritize  renovate or replace systems that may be affected by year dates 
to date  downey has completed an inventory of all systems and determined which processes are most critical to supporting customer transaction processing and providing customer services 
system renovation and replacement plans have been started and are targeted for completion by the end of  with compliance testing and installation processes to be completed during downey believes that this process is designed to be successful and will be utilizing current technology in seeking to assure year compliant systems 
however  third party vendor dependency  including government entities  may impact downey s efforts to successfully complete year compliance for all systems in a timely fashion 
downey is requiring that third party vendors represent their products to be year compliant and has planned a program to test for compliance 
contingency plans are being developed in the event that a vendor is not able to provide a year compliant solution 
commercial loan borrowers of downey may also be impacted by year issues 
downey has embarked on an awareness program to bring these issues to the borrower s attention and to determine the extent of their preparations for year in addition  lending guidelines will take into consideration how year issues will impact their business and possibly their ability to repay loan obligations to downey 
downey currently estimates that the year project may cost approximately million 
this cost is in addition to existing personnel who may participate in the project and includes estimates for hardware and software renovation or replacement  as well as additions to existing staff who will be specifically devoted to the project 
approximately of the cost represents costs to migrate to a new personal computer environment and to replace certain older automated teller machines  both of which downey might otherwise have implemented replaced during the period notwithstanding the year issue 
as such  that portion of the year costs are projected to be amortized over the useful life of the equipment 
of the estimated million total cost  approximately million was incurred in  with approximately million to be expensed in each of and  approximately million in  with the balance in subsequent years 
as downey progresses in addressing the year issue  estimates of costs could change  including failure of any third party vendor to provide year compliant solutions in a timely fashion
