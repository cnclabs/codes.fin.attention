these efforts had a meaningful impact on the company s results of operations beginning in the second half of fiscal in december  the company completed the rusty wallace acquisition  in which it acquired assets related to sales of motorsports merchandise licensed by nascar driver rusty wallace

in september  the company acquired a majority interest in performance plus  which develops and markets driver endorsed nutritional products  including vitamins  energy bars  and energy drinks 
in addition to the cost savings described above  the company believes that the acquisitions described above provide the potential for enhanced revenue opportunities as a result of the synergies created by expanded product offerings and additional distribution channels 
for example  in fiscal the company began developing new lines of licensed motorsports apparel and souvenirs for exclusive sales through its collectors club 
the company also believes that these acquisitions provide opportunities for additional sales growth of the company s die cast products through trackside sales  promotional programs  and fan clubs 
prior to the fiscal and acquisitions  the company s revenue consisted primarily of sales of die cast collectibles  and the revenue of the acquired businesses consisted primarily of sales of either die cast or other collectibles or licensed motorsports apparel and souvenirs 
promotional revenue consists of sales of products developed for corporate promotion programs 
beginning in fiscal  the company s revenue includes royalty income as a result of the license agreement with hasbro 
the company s cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of products procured from third party manufacturers  royalty payments to licensors  and depreciation of tooling and dies 
significant factors affecting the company s cost of sales as a percentage of net sales include i the overall percentage of net sales represented by sales of die cast collectible products  which typically carry higher gross margins than the company s other products  ii the percentage of sales of die cast collectible products represented by sales through the collectors club  which typically carry higher gross margins than sales of such products through wholesale distributors  and iii the effect of amortizing the fixed cost components of cost of sales  primarily depreciation of tooling and dies  over varying levels of net sales 
the company believes that the increased sales of licensed apparel and souvenirs following the fiscal acquisitions will result in lower overall gross margins as a result of lower gross margins generally associated with these acquired product lines 
the company believes  however  that the effect of these lower gross margins will be mitigated at least to some extent by cost reductions and other operational efficiencies associated with the combination of the acquired entities and by the license agreement with hasbro 
the agreement with hasbro provides the company with a source of license royalties without significant related cost of sales 
in addition  the license agreement provides the company with access to the mass merchandise market without committing capital for manufacturing and with limited marginal expenditures for administrative and marketing activities 
selling  general  and administrative expenses include general corporate expenses 
the company anticipates that it will continue to achieve a reduction in selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales as a result of consolidation and the cost reduction efforts described above

see item  legal proceedings 
the company has made no provision in its financial statements with respect to these matters 
the imposition of damages in one or more of the cases against the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operation and financial position 
the company believes that its current cash resources  the credit facility  and expected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund the company s capital needs during the next months at its current level of operations  apart from capital needs resulting from additional acquisitions 
however  the company may be required to obtain additional capital to fund its planned growth during the next months and beyond 
potential sources of any such capital may include the proceeds from the exercise of outstanding options  bank financing  strategic alliances  and additional offerings of the company s equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance that such capital will be available from these or other potential sources  and the lack of such capital could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
year compliance during  the company commenced a program to install new computer software programs that are intended to integrate the company s management information systems throughout its organizational structure  as well as to comply with year requirements 
the company has experienced delays in completing this program 
as of the filing date of this report  the installation program is approximately complete and the company currently anticipates that the new software systems will be operational in the second quarter of calendar the company believes that its new software systems will comply with the year requirements  and the company currently does not anticipate that it will experience any material disruption to its operations as a result of the failure of any of its systems to function properly beyond december  computer systems operated by third parties  including customers  vendors  credit card transaction processors  and financial institutions  with which the company s systems interface may not continue to properly interface with the company s systems and may not otherwise be compliant on a timely basis with year requirements 
the company s third party manufacturers of die cast  apparel  and other products do not rely heavily on computer operated systems in their manufacturing processes 
accordingly  the company does not believe that year issues pose a significant risk with respect to the manufacture of its products 
because the company s business typically does not generate a large volume of purchase orders for its products  the company believes it could rely on non automated ordering systems if its vendors computer systems fail as a result of year issues 
any failure of the company s computer system or the systems of third parties to timely achieve year compliance  however  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and operating results 
as of the filing date of this report  the company has not developed a contingency plan to address year issues 
if by april   the company has not completed the installation and start up of its new computer software systems or it determines that any third party on which it relies will not be able to adequately address year issues  the company intends to immediately begin development of an appropriate contingency program
