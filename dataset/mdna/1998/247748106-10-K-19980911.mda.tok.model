liquidity and capital resources because of the seasonal nature of delta s sales  the smallest proportion of cash generated from operations is received during the warmer months when sales volumes decrease considerably 
additionally  most construction activity takes place during the non heating season because of more favorable weather conditions 
during the warmer  non heating months  therefore  cash needs for operations and construction are partially met through short term borrowings 
capital expenditures for delta for fiscal are expected to be million 
delta generates internally only a portion of the cash necessary for its capital expenditure requirements and finances the balance of its capital expenditures on an interim basis through the use of its borrowing capability under its short term line of credit 
the current available line of credit is  of which  was borrowed at june  the line of credit  which is with bank one  kentucky  na  requires renewal during november  these short term borrowings are periodically repaid with the net proceeds from the sale of long term debt and equity securities  as was done in march   when the net proceeds of  from the sale of  of debentures were used to repay short term debt and to redeem the company s debentures  that would have matured in  in the amount of  the primary cash flows during the last three years are summarized below provided by operating activities    used in investing activities    provided by financing activities    net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents    cash provided by operating activities consists of net income and noncash items including depreciation  depletion  amortization and deferred income taxes

interest charges the increase in interest on long term debt during of  was due primarily to the issuance of million of debentures in march  the increase in other interest during of  was due primarily to increased average short term debt borrowings 
the increases in interest on long term debt and amortization of debt expense during of  and  respectively  were due primarily to the issuance of million of debentures during july  the decrease in other interest during of  was due primarily to decreased average short term borrowings as short term debt was repaid with the net proceeds from the sale of long term debt and equity securities during july  earnings per common share for the years ended june  and  basic earnings per common share declined  as compared with previous periods  as a result of the increased average common shares outstanding that resulted from the additional  shares of common stock issued in july   as well as the common shares issued under delta s dividend reinvestment plan and shares issued to employees during the periods 
other than delta s outstanding common shares  there are no potentially dilutive securities 
therefore  basic and diluted earnings per common share are the same
