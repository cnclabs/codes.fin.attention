borrowings under the credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all of lason s assets 
lason is not required to make principal payments prior to  the term of the loan 
interest on amounts outstanding is calculated based on interest rates determined at the time of borrowing 
borrowings bear interest at rates ranging from libor plus a maximum of as of march  to a base percentage rate plus a maximum of as of march   depending on the company s leverage ratio 
the credit agreement contains restrictions on the acquisition of stock or assets  disposal of assets  incurrence of other liabilities  minimum requirements for cash flow and certain financial ratios 
as of march   million is outstanding under the credit agreement 
future capital needs the company s liquidity and capital resources have been significantly affected by acquisitions of businesses and  given the company s acquisition strategy  may be significantly affected for the foreseeable future 
to date  the company has financed its acquisitions with borrowings under its credit agreement  with shares of its common stock and with cash from operations 
the company s ability to obtain cash adequate to fund its needs depends generally on the results of its operations and the availability of financing 
management believes that cash flow from operations  in conjunction with borrowings from its existing and any future credit agreements and possible issuance of shares of its common stock  will be sufficient to meet debt service requirements  make possible future acquisitions and fund capital expenditures in the future 
however  there can be no assurance in this regard or that the terms available for any future financing  if required  would be favorable to the company 
year the company is addressing the need to achieve year date conversion with no effect on customers or disruption to business operations 
the company is communicating with suppliers  customers  and others with which it does business to coordinate year conversion issues 
the cost of compliance  which is not yet completely determined  is not expected to be material in relation to the company s future results of operations due to the nature of the company s operating systems 
inflation certain of the company s expenses  such as wages and benefits  occupancy costs  and equipment repair and replacement  are subject to normal inflation 
supplies  such as paper and related products  can be subject to significant price fluctuations 
although the company to date has been able to substantially offset any such cost increases through increased operating efficiencies  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to offset any future cost increases through similar efficiencies or increased charges for its products and services
