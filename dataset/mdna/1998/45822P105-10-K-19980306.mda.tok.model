wpsr s wholly owned subsidiaries include wpsc  wps energy services  inc esi  and wps power development  inc 
pdi 
compared with wps resources corporation overview revenues at wpsr increased from million in to million in  or 
net income increased from million in to million in basic and diluted earnings per share increased  from in to in the primary reasons for the increase in earnings at wpsr were decreased operating and maintenance expenses  increased other income  an increased nonregulated energy margin  and an increased gas utility margin 
partially offsetting these increases in earnings were a decrease in the electric utility margin  an increase in depreciation and decommissioning expense  and an increase in income tax expense 
earnings on common stock of wpsc were million in and million in nonregulated losses were million in and million in wisconsin public service corporation overview revenues at wpsc were million in compared with million in  a decrease of 
earnings on common stock increased  from million in to million in the primary reasons for the increase in earnings at wpsc were a decrease in operating and maintenance expenses  an increase in other income  and an increase in the gas utility margin 
offsetting these increases in earnings were a decrease in the electric utility margin  an increase in depreciation and decommissioning expense  and an increase in income tax expense 
electric utility operations electric margins decreased million see table below  or  due to implementation of a public service commission of wisconsin pscw rate order which authorized a million  or  electric revenue reduction 
a second factor contributing to decreased margins was increased replacement power costs as a result of an extended outage at the kewaunee nuclear power plant kewaunee 
wpsc is the operator and owner of kewaunee 
a surcharge authorized by the pscw partially offset increases in replacement power costs in the latter part of the first quarter and in the second quarter of electric margins revenues    fuel and purchased power    margins    sales kwh    in spite of a decrease in cooling degree days  electric kilowatt hour kwh sales increased by due to increased demand by commercial and industrial customers 
commercial and industrial kwh sales increased  while wholesale kwh sales decreased 
electric operating revenues decreased million  or  due primarily to the electric rate decrease 
electric production fuel expense increased million  or 
nuclear fuel expense was million lower than in due to decreased generation at kewaunee in the first and second quarters of as a result of an extended outage 
steam fuel expense was higher by million and combustion turbine generation expense was higher by million due to increased generation requirements from these sources during the extended outage at kewaunee 
purchased power expense increased million  or  due to increased purchase requirements and higher costs of purchased power during the extended outage at kewaunee 
the pscw allows wpsc to pass changes in the cost of fuel and purchased power  within a specified range  on to its customers through a fuel adjustment clause 
wpsc is required to file an application to adjust rates either higher or lower when costs are plus or minus from forecasted costs on an annual basis 
the additional fuel costs in did not result in wpsc being outside this window 
gas utility operations gas margins increased million see table below  or  due primarily to implementation of a pscw rate order which authorized a million  or  increase in gas revenues 
gas margins revenues    purchase costs    margins    volume therms    gas operating revenues remained relatively stable reflecting the rate increase offset by a reduction in heating degree days 
gas revenues also reflect a one time reduction of million in the first quarter of as a result of a pscw directive to change the accounting treatment for previous customer line extensions 
this reduction represents a decrease of approximately 
per share after income tax effects 
gas purchase costs showed a net decrease of million  or  due primarily to reduced purchases because of decreased demand as a result of the reduction in heating degree days 
the pscw allows wpsc to pass changes in the cost of gas on to customers through a purchased gas adjustment clause pgac 
other utility expenses income other operating expenses at wpsc decreased million  or 
cost saving initiatives and decreased amortization of deferred demand side management expenditures resulted in lower customer service and sales expenses of million 
administrative expenses decreased million due to cost saving measures and reduced postretirement medical  dental  and other benefit expenses 
generation operating expenses were lower by million primarily as a result of the completion in of an amortization of deferred expenses related to a previous coal contract settlement 
gas operating expenses decreased million as the result of a pscw directive requiring gas servicing revenues and expenses to be classified as other income and deductions beginning in maintenance expense decreased million  or 
electric transmission and distribution expenses decreased million as a result of cost saving initiatives and less maintenance of overhead lines in due to less storm damage 
expenses were million lower at kewaunee in because kewaunee was out of service in for scheduled maintenance 
gas distribution had lower expenses of million due to cost saving initiatives and decreased maintenance activities 
steam costs decreased million at wpsc s coal fired plants due to changes in maintenance schedules as a result of the extended outage at kewaunee 
depreciation and decommissioning expenses increased million  or  largely due to the accelerated recovery of investment in kewaunee and accelerated funding of kewaunee decommissioning costs 
other income increased million  or  due primarily to gains in on the sale of nonutility property of million which represented an increase of approximately 
per share after income tax effects 
also included in other income in was interest of million resulting from an income tax audit settlement 
income tax expense increased million reflecting higher net income in overview of nonregulated operations nonregulated operations primarily represent the gas and electric sales of esi  an energy marketing subsidiary 
nonregulated operations also include pdi which participates in the development of electric generation projects  invests in generating projects  and provides services to the electric power generation industry 
nonregulated operations experienced a loss of million in compared with a loss of million in on a stand alone basis  wpsr incurred a net loss in of million  compared with net income of million in the wpsr stand alone loss was attributable primarily to costs related to the proposed merger with upper peninsula energy corporation upen 
esi incurred a loss of million in and million in  a decrease of 
pdi incurred a loss of million in and million in  a decrease of 
operating losses at the nonregulated subsidiaries were anticipated by management as the companies develop infrastructure and finance additional working capital needed to support growth 
nonregulated margins gas margins at esi increased million from a negative million in to a positive million in in  customer commitments at esi were not fully hedged during a period of volatile gas commodity markets and certain gas suppliers defaulted which negatively impacted margins 
electric margins increased million in nonregulated energy and other operating revenues increased million  or 
the increase in nonregulated energy revenues consisted largely of increased gas sales at esi of million  or  as a result of customer growth and increased electric sales of million  or nonregulated energy cost of sales increased million  or  due primarily to increased gas purchases and purchased power of million and million  respectively  at esi 
other nonregulated expenses income other nonregulated operating expenses increased million  or 
other operating expenses increased million at wpsr due primarily to expenses associated with the upen merger 
other operating expenses at esi increased million  or  due to expansion of the business and the development of infrastructure as esi positions itself for the future 
although increased margins more than offset other operating expenses  interest costs increased due to the financing of additional working capital needed to support the growth of esi 
other operating expenses at pdi increased million as a result of expansion of the business and operation of the stoneman power plant stoneman 
project revenues at pdi partially offset costs related to the investigation of possible energy related investments and a loss from stoneman operations 
esi experienced trading losses of million in and million in pdi experienced a loss of million in related to the write off of an investment in an industrial processing facility 
this write off represented a decrease in earnings of 
per share after income tax effects 
compared with wps resources corporation overview revenues at wpsr increased from million in to million in net income was million in compared with million in  a decrease of 
basic and diluted earnings per share were in and in  a decrease of 
the most significant reasons for the decrease in earnings at wpsr were increased operating expenses at the nonregulated subsidiaries  decreased gas margins at esi  a loss on an industrial processing facility investment at pdi  and increased operating expenses at wpsc 
earnings on common stock of wpsc were million in and million in nonregulated losses were million in and million in wisconsin public service corporation overview revenues at wpsc increased  from million in to million in earnings on common stock increased  from million in to million in electric utility operations electric margins increased million  or  due primarily to increased sales volumes and decreased purchased power expenses 
electric operating revenues remained relatively stable between and electric production fuels and purchased power decreased million  or  as a result of million lower purchased power costs  million lower generation costs at kewaunee due to an extended outage  and million lower combustion turbine generation costs 
offsetting these decreases was an increase in generating costs at coal fired plants of million 
gas utility operations gas margins increased million  or  due to customer growth at wpsc and colder weather 
based on degree days  the weather was colder in than in gas operating revenues increased million  or  and gas purchased for resale increased million  or  both due to increased volumes as a result of customer growth and higher gas costs 
other utility expenses income other operating expenses at wpsc increased million  or 
higher operating expenses included an increase of million related to expansion of certain operating activities in anticipation of more competitive markets and an increase in gas operating expenses of million as a result of customer growth 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in employee benefit costs of approximately million due to a reduction in postretirement benefit expenses 
maintenance expense decreased million  or  due to lower maintenance activity at wpsc s coal fired plants of million 
this decrease was partially offset by increased maintenance expense at kewaunee of million 
overview of nonregulated operations nonregulated energy and other operating revenues increased  from million in to million in the loss at the nonregulated subsidiaries was million in and million in nonregulated margins gas margins at esi decreased from a positive million in to a negative million in gas margins were negatively impacted due primarily to the volatile gas commodity market experienced during in which esi was not fully hedged for its customer commitments and esi s decision to honor customer contracts  despite defaults by certain gas suppliers  during a period of exceptionally high demand 
nonregulated energy and other operating revenues increased million  or 
nonregulated energy revenues primarily represent electric and gas sales made by esi 
the increase in nonregulated energy revenues was due to increased gas sales at esi from million in to million in  an increase of million  or 
the increased gas sales resulted from esi s acquisition of a gas marketing company in the fourth quarter of  additional customer growth in the wholesale market  and higher unit prices due to gas commodity market conditions 
other operating revenues increased million  or  and were comprised of consulting and construction revenue from esi and pdi 
nonregulated energy cost of sales increased million  or  due primarily to increased gas purchases and increased gas costs at esi from million in to million in  an increase of million  or 
other nonregulated expenses income other operating expenses increased million reflecting the expansion of esi s and pdi s business and the development of infrastructure including personnel and systems 
in  pdi experienced a million loss on a write off of an investment in an industrial processing facility which had been made in anticipation of energy sales opportunities 
this loss represented a 
per share decrease in earnings after income tax effects 
esi experienced trading losses of million in balance sheet compared with nuclear decommissioning trusts increased million due to continued funding and favorable investment returns 
customer receivables decreased million primarily as a result of decreased sales and increased collection efforts at wpsc 
regulatory assets decreased million due primarily to gas plant cleanup insurance recoveries recorded as an offset to regulatory assets in investments and other assets increased million as a result of increased prepaid pension assets and an increased unrealized gain on the nuclear decommissioning trust 
short term notes payable and commercial paper decreased million and million  respectively  due to decreased operational cash needs at wpsc and decreased notes payable at wpsr 
internally generated funds exceeded cash requirements at both wpsc and wpsr 
financial condition internally generated funds exceeded wpsr s cash requirements resulting in the reduction of short term borrowings during pretax interest coverage was times for the months ended december  for wpsc 
wpsc s bond ratings are aa standard poor s and duff phelps and aa moody s 
wpsc is restricted by a pscw order to paying normal common stock dividends of no more than of the previous year s common stock dividends without prior notice to the pscw 
also  wisconsin law prohibits wpsc from making loans to wpsr and its nonregulated subsidiaries and from guaranteeing their obligations 
a special common stock dividend of million was paid by wpsc to wpsr in january the special dividend allowed wpsc s average equity capitalization ratio to remain at approximately  the level approved by the pscw for ratemaking 
wpsc makes large investments in capital assets 
construction expenditures for wpsc are expected to continue in the million to million range annually during the through period 
this does not include expenditures for the replacement of kewaunee steam generators 
steam generator replacement  wpsc s share of which would be approximately million in year of occurrence dollars  is contingent upon receipt of approval from the pscw to proceed with replacement and agreement among the owners on a replacement plan 
potential expenditures for gas pipeline laterals which would connect wpsc s distribution system with the proposed viking voyageur pipeline from canada are also not included 
in addition  other capital requirements for wpsc during the three year period include kewaunee decommissioning trust fund contributions of approximately million and maturing first mortgage bonds of million 
wpsr expects that internally generated funds and short term borrowing will satisfy most of its capital requirements 
wpsr may periodically issue additional long term debt and common stock to reduce short term debt and to maintain desired capitalization ratios 
the specific forms of financing  amounts  and timing will depend on the availability of projects  market conditions  and other factors 
wpsr may expand its leveraged employee stock ownership plan during the three year period 
trusted preferred stock may be issued on behalf of wpsr in to reduce short term borrowing 
investment expenditures for nonregulated projects are uncertain since there are no material firm commitments at this time 
debt financing for most nonregulated projects is expected to be on a nonrecourse basis 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets to be disposed of  became effective in march this statement imposes a stricter criterion for regulatory assets by requiring that such assets be probable of future recovery at each balance sheet date 
wpsr adopted this statement on january  the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations based on the current regulatory structure 
sfas no 
may impact wpsr in the future as competitive factors influence wholesale and retail pricing in the electric and gas industries and as regulatory policy regarding recovery of stranded investment is developed 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  became effective in this statement permits  but does not require  companies to change their accounting for stock based compensation 
the statement also requires additional disclosures 
wpsr has adopted only the disclosure provision of the statement and currently does not provide significant stock based compensation 
in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 earnings per share 
this statement establishes standards for computing and presenting earnings per share 
adoption of this standard by wpsr at december  had no impact on the presentation of earnings per share as basic and diluted earnings per share are identical to previously reported earnings per share 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 reporting of comprehensive income  which establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components of revenues  expenses  gains  and losses

the merger is expected to be completed during the second half of upen will merge with and into wpsr  and upper peninsula power company  upen s utility subsidiary  will become a wholly owned subsidiary of wpsr 
each of the  outstanding shares of upen common stock no par value will be converted into shares of wpsr common stock par value  subject to adjustment for fractional shares  as provided in the merger agreement 
effective march   wpsc received authorization from the pscw to defer all costs associated with the repair of the kewaunee steam generators 
repairs are complete and kewaunee returned to service on june  after having been out of service since september  repair costs of million wpsc s portion have been deferred 
the joint owners of kewaunee have requested rate recovery of these deferred costs through a customer surcharge which would be effective for april and may on july   the pscw authorized wpsc to defer all advertising costs associated with developing a communication plan to educate customers on the potential energy shortage 
wpsc was also authorized to defer all costs related to returning its fossil fueled plant  pulliam unit  to service and all subsequent operating costs for pulliam unit until the next rate filing 
the recovery of these deferred costs will be considered in a future rate proceeding 
to date  approximately million related to advertising costs and pulliam unit operating costs has been deferred 
a pscw order granting a certificate of public convenience and necessity for construction of the de pere energy center was issued on october  wpsc has a year commitment with polsky energy corporation to purchase the output of the facility which is scheduled for operation in the transaction will be accounted for as a capital lease 
wpsc will make any necessary adjustments to debt and equity levels  and appropriate rate relief is expected 
should electric retail deregulation occur  this contract may be deemed uneconomical which could require a loss accrual if the regulator would not allow recovery as part of the deregulation transition plan 
wpsc s contract with the international union of operating engineers local expired on october  unresolved issues remain and contract negotiations continue 
approximately  employees are covered under this contract 
the employees continue to work without a contract 
wpsr has completed an initial assessment of the impact of the year compliance on its computer systems 
wpsr worked with a consultant beginning in to analyze the year problem 
plans have been established to analyze all in house and third party software products and applications 
a preliminary plan indicates that all major in house developed systems are expected to be compliant by the end of the plan is intended to enable all systems to be compliant by the year the most recent estimated future internal labor and third party cost of year compliance is approximately million 
trends wpsc follows sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  and its financial statements reflect the effects of the different ratemaking principles followed by the various jurisdictions regulating the utility 
these include the pscw  of revenues  the michigan public service commission mpsc  of revenues  and the ferc  of revenues 
in addition  kewaunee is regulated by the nuclear regulatory commission nrc 
environmental matters are primarily governed by the united states environmental protection agency and the wisconsin department of natural resources 
in late  the pscw outlined its plan for restructuring the electric industry in wisconsin 
the plan included steps in a year process concluding with retail competition by the year in  the step process was changed to a step process which has not yet been adopted as the official pscw restructuring plan 
should electric deregulation occur such that wpsc would no longer qualify to reflect the effects of ratemaking under sfas no 
in its financial statements  no impairment of significant recorded assets or reduction in reported equity is anticipated 
wpsc does not have any significant assets which it foresees as being potentially stranded and no potential disparity between the depreciable lives of wpsc s capital assets and those lives applicable to a competitive environment has been identified 
increased competition is likely to put pressure on margins at wpsc 
however  at this time  management cannot predict the ultimate results of deregulation 
part of electric utility restructuring involves establishing independent system operators isos 
an iso is an independent third party which potentially owns the transmission facilities  oversees the operations of transmission facilities  administers open access transmission tariffs  and directs power dispatch 
wpsc is working with several groups which are attempting to form isos 
during the past summer  governor thompson requested reports from the pscw  electric utilities  and industrial customers assessing the electric capacity problems experienced in eastern wisconsin during this past spring and summer 
the reports provided analyses and recommendations on how to assure the future reliability of the electrical supply and made recommendations on how to improve the effectiveness of the state s utility regulatory process 
wpsc participated in the development of the utility report 
the governor is expected to make energy supply and regulatory recommendations based on the reports 
both the pscw and the mpsc continue to review gas industry restructuring 
in a current docket  the pscw is addressing gas restructuring issues including unbundling of rates  pricing of contracted services in potential utility bypass situations  and the separation of gas utilities from their nonregulated gas marketing affiliates 
the mpsc is conducting pilot studies to test the development of competitive retail gas markets in michigan 
wpsc has historically recovered gas costs through a pgac 
the pscw has recently allowed utilities to select either an incentive gas cost recovery mechanism or a modified one for one mechanism for gas cost recovery 
wpsc has selected the modified one for one gas cost recovery plan and implementation of the new mechanism  which is currently under development and is similar to the recovery received under the existing pgac  is expected in november wpsc is investigating the environmental cleanup of eight manufactured gas plant sites 
cleanup estimates have been determined for seven of the sites 
a detailed investigation has not yet been performed for the eighth site 
future investigation and cleanup costs for all eight sites is estimated in the range of million to million 
these estimates may be adjusted in the future contingent upon remedial technology  regulatory requirements  and experience gained through cleanup activities 
an initial liability of million for cleanup had been established with an offsetting regulatory asset deferred charge 
of this amount  approximately million has been spent to date 
management believes that cleanup costs net of insurance recoveries  but not the carrying costs associated with the cleanup expenditures  will be recoverable in current and future customer rates 
wpsc has received million in insurance recoveries which have been recorded as a reduction in the regulatory asset 
the pscw has authorized current annualized recovery for gas site cleanup of  for and wpsc is in compliance with both the phase i and ii sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission limits established by the federal clean air act amendments of additional capital expenditures of million to million are projected through for wisconsin and federal air quality compliance 
management believes that all costs incurred for additional compliance will be recoverable in future customer rates 
on march   wpsc filed an application with the pscw for permission to replace the kewaunee steam generators 
public hearings were held in january of a decision is expected in march of the total cost of replacing the two steam generators would be approximately million 
wpsc s share would be million in year of occurrence dollars 
the other two owners of kewaunee do not favor steam generator replacement 
wpsc received a rate order in the wisconsin jurisdiction effective in february the impact was approximately a million decrease in electric revenues and a million increase in gas revenues on an annual basis 
the new rates are effective for and wpsc intends to file an application with the pscw on april  for electric and gas rate increases which would be effective in and esi incurred a million loss in and a million loss in a primary strategy for esi is rapid growth to gain market presence which is reflected in a growth in revenues during the three year period through  from million in to million in to support this growth  significant expenditures were made for personnel additions and system improvements 
these expenditures  coupled with extreme gas market volatility  contributed to the losses incurred at esi 
gas market volatility was reflected in the nymex gas futures prices per dekatherm which  in  ranged from a high of to a low of 
in  gas futures prices ranged from a high of to a low of 
gas market volatility has a direct impact on revenue 
pdi expects to improve the overall performance of its investment in stoneman due to a multi year capacity sale agreement 
stoneman was also grandfathered by the pscw as a merchant plant which increases the probability that the plant will be repowered as a megawatt to megawatt gas fired combined cycle generating facility 
impact of inflation wpsr s current financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and report operating results in terms of historic cost 
they provide a reasonable  objective  and quantifiable statement of financial results  but they do not evaluate the impact of inflation 
under rate treatment prescribed by utility regulatory commissions  wpsc s projected operating costs are recoverable in revenues 
because forecasts are prepared assuming inflation  the majority of inflationary effects on normal operating costs are recoverable in rates 
however  in these forecasts  wpsc is only allowed to recover the historic cost of plant via depreciation
