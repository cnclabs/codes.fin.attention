in thousands three months ended net sales     cost of sales     gross profits     net income     basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share the company s results of operations have historically fluctuated on a quarterly basis 
as a result of these seasonal trends  sales and earnings for each of the first three quarters have been significantly lower than sales in the fourth quarter 
these fluctuations are expected to are expected to continue because of numerous factors  including i practices of insurance companies and other third party payors with respect to reimbursement for the company s products  which tend to result in increased sales of the company s external infusion pumps later in the calendar year  after patients deductibles are satisfied  ii market acceptance of the company s products  iii timing of regulatory approvals  iv new product introductions  v competition  vi the company s ability to manufacture its products efficiently and vii timing of research and development expenditures 
year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year there is general concern whether this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
during  the company initiated a review of its existing computer software to determine the extent to which the company s systems and processes are vulnerable to the year issue 
management has determined that the year issue will not pose operational problems for its computer systems 
costs for reviewing the compliance of the current systems are being expensed as incurred and are not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations 
in anticipation of continued growth and expansion of the company s sales activities  continuing interaction with third party payors and the need to consolidate the various systems employed by minimed and hms  the company has commenced a system development effort to improve and consolidate insurance  reimbursement and collection software  and to assess the internal and external risks related to the year issue with respect to these systems 
external resources are being used for this project  while the company continues to develop its internal resources in this area 
the expenditures for this project will be capitalized  with estimated total costs ranging from  to  the project should be completed in item a
