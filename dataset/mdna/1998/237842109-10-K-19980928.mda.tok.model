in july  the company received net proceeds of approximately  from the issuance of preferred stock and warrants to purchase  and  shares of common stock 
in addition  the purchasers of the preferred stock and warrants have agreed to purchase  subject to the company s satisfaction of certain conditions as to which there can be no assurance  an additional  of preferred stock and warrants at a second closing on or before january  the preferred stock is redeemable under certain circumstances 
see note to the company s financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report and certain business risks potential redemption of convertible preferred stock 
the company s ability to sustain operations  make future capital expenditures and fund the development and marketing of new products  including the be there remote access system  are highly dependent on existing cash  the ability to close on the second funding of the preferred stock  and the company s return to profitability 
the timing and amount of the company s future capital requirements can not be accurately predicted 
the company does not anticipate a return to profitability as long as its expenditures on the be there system remain disproportionate to attendant revenue 
as a result  the company will likely require additional financing in the future  the failure to obtain such financing when needed would have a substantial adverse effect on the company 
if the company s plans to improve operations and fund the second closing of the preferred stock are not successful  management will consider  strategic and or financial alliances with third parties

the assessment phase of the year project is substantially complete 
virtually all of the compliance was performed or is expected to be performed by company personnel 
the total estimated cost of the year conversion is not deemed material to the company and is being expensed as incurred 
in addition to internal year implementation activities  the company is in communication with third party suppliers and vendors with whom which the company s systems communicate and interact to determine the extent to which those companies are addressing their year compliance problems 
there can be no assurance that there will not be an adverse effect on the company if third parties  such as suppliers or service providers  do not bring their systems into compliance in a timely manner 
however  management believes that ongoing communication with  assessment of  and coordination with these parties will minimize these risks 
although the company anticipates minimal business disruption will occur as a result of year issues  possible consequences include  but are not limited to  disruption of voice mail communications  purchase order processing  and other normal business activities 
to date  the company has not established a contingency plan for possible year issues 
where needed  the company will establish contingency plans based on its actual testing experience and assessment of outside risks 
the company anticipates contingency plans to be in place by june  the cost of and the completion dates are based on management s best estimates and may be updated as additional information becomes available
