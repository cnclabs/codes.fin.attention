liquidity and capital resources the company s need for capital has historically been to maintain or increase the surplus of its insurance subsidiaries and to support the company as an insurance holding company  including the maintenance of its status as a public company 
in addition  the company requires capital to fund its anticipated growth through acquisitions of other companies and blocks of insurance business 
the company the company requires cash to pay the operating expenses necessary to support its status as an insurance holding company which under applicable insurance department regulations must bear its own expenses  and to meet the cost involved in being a publicly owned company 
in addition  it will require cash to meet universal s obligations under the unstacking agreement and the debentures outstanding thereunder and to meet the quarterly amortization of the bank loan entered into on december  on december   the company entered into an agreement with chase manhattan bank for a  five year  secured term loan 
the loan proceeds were used to finance a segment of the intercompany sale of american pioneer from american progressive to universal and to retire the  amount outstanding on the term loan agreement with a commercial bank

the debentures pay interest quarterly at the prime rate and are payable on september  management believes that the current cash position and expected cash flows of the non insurance companies and the availability of dividends from american pioneer can support the obligations of universal noted above for the foreseeable future 
although  there can be no assurance as to the expected future cash flows or to the availability of dividends from american pioneer 
insurance subsidiaries american progressive  american pioneer and american exchange are required to maintain minimum amounts of capital and surplus as determined by statutory accounting 
the minimum statutory capital and surplus requirements of american progressive  american pioneer and american exchange as of december  for the maintenance of authority to do business were   and  respectively  but substantially more than such minimum amounts are needed to support the current level of the company s operations 
at december  the adjusted statutory capital and surplus  including asset valuation reserve  of american  american pioneer and american exchange was   and  respectively 
the naic has adopted risk based capital rbc rules  which became effective december  and have been adopted by new york  florida and texas 
see regulation risk based capital requirements 
the rbc rules provide for various actions when the ratio of a company s total adjusted surplus to its rbc falls below 
at december   american progressive  american pioneer and american exchange had rbc ratios of approximately  and of the authorized control level  respectively 
liquidity for the life insurance subsidiaries is measured by their ability to pay scheduled contractual benefits  pay operating expenses  and fund investment commitments 
sources of liquidity include scheduled and unscheduled principal and interest payments on investments  premium payments and deposits and the sale of liquid investments 
these sources of liquidity for the insurance subsidiaries significantly exceed scheduled uses 
liquidity is also affected by unscheduled benefit payments including death benefits  benefits under accident and health policies and interest sensitive policy surrenders and withdrawals 
the amount of surrenders and withdrawals is affected by a variety of factors such as credited interest rates for similar products  general economic conditions and events in the industry that affect policyholders confidence 
although the contractual terms of substantially all of the company s in force life insurance policies and annuities give the holders the right to surrender the policies and annuities  the company imposes penalties for early surrenders 
at december  the company held reserves that exceeded the underlying cash surrender values of its in force life insurance and annuities by more than million 
the insurance companies have not experienced any material changes in surrender and withdrawal activity in recent years 
changes in interest rates may affect the incidence of policy surrenders and withdrawals 
in addition to the potential impact on liquidity  unanticipated surrenders and withdrawals in a changed interest rate environment could adversely affect earnings if the company were required to sell investments at reduced values in order to meet liquidity demands 
the company manages the asset and liability portfolios in order to minimize the adverse earnings impact of changing market rates 
the company seeks to invest in assets which have duration and interest spread characteristics similar to the liabilities that they support 
as a result of the decrease in economic interest rates  the net yield on the company s cash and invested assets decreased from in to in a significant portion of these securities are held to support the liabilities for policyholder account balances  which liabilities are subject to periodic adjustments to their credited interest rates 
the credited interest rates of the interest sensitive policyholder account balances are determined by management based upon factors such as portfolio rates of return and prevailing market rates and typically follow the pattern of yields on the assets supporting these liabilities 
at december   the investment portfolios of the life insurance subsidiaries included cash and cash equivalents totaling  as well as fixed maturity and equity securities that could readily be converted to cash with carrying values and fair values of  the fair values of these liquid investments totaled more than  and constituted approximately of the company s investments at december  at december   all of the company investments were income producing and current in interest and principal payments 
in addition  the company has no investment in any derivative instruments or other hybrid securities that contain any off balance sheet risk or investments in other securities whose fair values and principal repayments would be highly volatile to changes in interest rates  except for gnma s  fnma s and investment grade corporate collateralized mortgage obligations 
impact of year the company s main operating system utilizes programs that were written using four digit codes to define the applicable year 
some of the company s older sytem s computer programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  those computer programs have time sensitive software that recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could cause a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has completed an initial assessment and will have to modify or replace portions of its software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
currently  the company expects the year project costs to be limited to the allocation of its data processing department resources and significant external expenses are not expected 
accordingly  no specific budget for such costs has been allocated 
the project is estimated to be completed not later than december  which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
the company believes that with modifications to existing software and or conversions of data to existing software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company has initiated formal communications with its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the company s interface systems are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
there is no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted and would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
effects of accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for certain debt and equity securities statement no 
 which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with earlier adoption permitted 
statement no 
requires that debt and equity securities be classified into three categories and accounted for as follows debt securities that the company has the positive intent and the ability to hold to maturity would be classified as held to maturity and reported at amortized cost 
debt and equity securities that are held for current resale would be classified as trading securities and reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
debt and equity securities not classified as held to maturity or as trading securities would be classified as available for sale and reported at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses would not be reflected in earnings but would be reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
the company adopted statement no 
on january   the effect of which increased its unrealized gains by  in november   the fasb issued a special report titled a guide to implementation of statement no 
on accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  which report allows enterprises to reassess the appropriateness of the classifications of all securities held and account for any resulting reclassifications between the investment accounts 
this one time reassessment had to be made prior to december  and be appropriately disclosed in the financial statements 
in december   the company did reassess the appropriateness of the classifications of its securities and reclassified all of the securities contained in the held to maturity account to the available for sale account as they may be considered for sale prior to maturity as part of the asset liability management strategy 
the carrying value of the securities reclassed to available for sale amounted to  and the fair value amounted to  this transfer resulted in the company increasing its unrealized gains by  as changes in interest rates occur  the carrying value of the securities classified as available for sale  as well as any securities which may in the future be classified as held for maturity  will be impacted 
typically  as interest rates rise  the carrying value of these securities may decline 
conversely  if interest rates decline  the carrying value of these securities may increase 
management cannot predict the impact that changes in future interest rates will have on the company s financial statements
