item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations introduction the company reported net earnings in of million on revenues of million  as compared to a net loss of million on revenues of million in  and a net loss of million on revenues of million in as discussed more fully below  the company s performance throughout reflects a generally stronger economy  lower fuel prices at the pump although prices are still above through levels  a continued emphasis on cost reduction and growth in the size of the company s owner operator fleet 
a discussion of the impact of the above and other factors on the results of operations in as compared to  and as compared to follows 
compared to key operating statistics change operating revenues millions net earnings loss nm average tractors   total loads s revenue miles millions average revenue per revenue mile operating revenues 
operating revenues increased by million  or in to million from million in the majority of this increase occurred in the owner operator fleet where revenues increased by million or 
brokered revenues also increased million or in over  while company fleet revenues decreased million or 
the increase in revenue miles volume in is primarily attributable to a increase in the average number of owner operator trucks 
the increase in average revenue per revenue mile price is a result of slightly improved competitive conditions which allowed prices to increase modestly during this price increase was minimally affected by fuel surcharge revenues which were relatively the same in  compared to operating expenses 
the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of operating expenses to operating revenues for the years ended december  and operating revenues operating expenses purchased transportation and equipment rents salaries  wages and benefits fuel and other operating expenses operating taxes and licenses insurance and claims depreciation other operating expenses total operating expenses in  the mix of company operated versus owner operator equipment shifted to a higher dependence on owner operator equipment  although the company was still primarily dependent on company operated tractors 
approximately of the company s revenue was generated with company operated equipment in  as compared to approximately in the decreased use of the company fleet in resulted in decreases in salaries  wages and benefits  and fixed costs operating taxes and licenses related to ownership or lease of revenue equipment 
conversely  higher use of owner operator equipment resulted in increases in purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue 
the company also benefited from lower fuel prices at the pump during the national average price per gallon at the pump declined approximately 
per gallon 
even with this decrease  the price per gallon at the pump is still approximately 
per gallon higher than it averaged during the first half of this decade 
relative to  management estimates this price decrease lowered operating expenses by approximately million in the company s insurance expense decreased to of revenue in from of revenue in this decrease is primarily due to better accident experience and slightly lower insurance premiums 
approximately one third of the company s insurance expense represented premium payments in and the remaining two thirds of the expenses are comprised of estimates for claims and deductible obligations resulting from accidents and claims 
depreciation expense decreased in as compared to as the company owned approximately fewer tractors in and replaced some capitalized leases with operating leases 
other operating expenses decreased to of revenue in from in primarily as a result of reduced communications expense and reduced legal and professional fees 
interest expense 
interest expense increased by approximately million in as compared to due to higher average borrowings over the course of the year 
following is a summary of interest expense for the years ended december  in millions interest and fees on notes payable to banks interest on capital leases and other indebtedness provision for income taxes 
the provision in was approximately million  or of pretax earnings 
the effective tax rate is lower than the statutory tax rate due to the utilization of certain post reorganization tax attributes which had a full valuation allowance  offset by the impact of certain non deductible expenses 
no provision for income taxes was provided in as a result of the operating losses incurred 
a million increase in the net deferred tax assets was offset by a million increase in valuation allowances 
compared to key operating statistics change operating revenues millions net earnings loss nm average tractors   total loads s revenue miles millions average revenue per revenue mile operating revenues 
operating revenues increased by million  or in to million from million in the majority of this increase occurred in the owner operator fleet where revenues increased by million or 
brokered revenues also increased nearly in over  while company fleet revenues increased 
the increase in revenue miles volume in is primarily attributable to a increase in the average number of owner operator trucks 
the decrease in average revenue per revenue mile is a result of significantly sharper competitive conditions which drove prices down in early while pricing recovered somewhat later in the year  some of the increased prices resulted from fuel surcharges intended to recover steeply higher fuel costs 
without fuel surcharges  the average revenue per revenue mile would have declined by in over operating expenses 
the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of operating expenses to operating revenues for the years ended december  and operating revenues operating expenses purchased transportation and equipment rents salaries  wages and benefits fuel and other operating expenses operating taxes and licenses insurance and claims depreciation other operating expenses total operating expenses in  the mix of company operated versus owner operator equipment began to shift back towards owner operator equipment  although the company was still primarily dependent on company operated tractors 
approximately of the company s revenue was generated with company operated equipment in  as compared to approximately in the relatively higher use of owner operator equipment in resulted in decreases in salaries  wages and benefits  and fixed costs related to ownership or lease of revenue equipment  and increases in owner operator purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue 
offsetting this trend towards higher owner operator based costs  and lower company operated equipment costs  however  was steeply higher fuel costs incurred to operate company equipment in management estimates that the approximately cent per gallon higher fuel price in resulted in increased fuel costs of approximately million over those incurred in operating taxes and licenses were relatively unchanged in when compared to the company s insurance expense increased to of revenue in from of revenue in this increase results primarily from increased provisions for accident claims 
approximately one third of the company s insurance expense in represented premium payments 
the remaining two thirds of the expense is comprised of estimates for claim and deductible obligations resulting from accidents and claims 
depreciation expense increased in as compared to as the company replaced older  fully depreciated trailers with new  modern replacement units 
other operating expenses decreased to of revenue in from in primarily as a result of reduced accounts receivable service fees  coupled with reduced legal and professional fees 
the company ceased selling certain accounts receivable to a collection clearing house effective june  interest expense 
interest expense decreased by approximately million in as compared to  due to lower interest and fees on the company s bank credit facility 
the credit facility was amended on january   lowering the interest rate from over prime to over prime  and reducing credit facility fees 
in addition  the prime rate was lower in  on average  than in average borrowings outstanding were flat 
following is a summary of interest expense for the years ended december  in millions interest on debentures interest and fees on notes payable to banks interest on capital leases and other indebtedness provision for income taxes 
no provision for income taxes was provided in as a result of the operating losses incurred 
a million increase in net deferred tax assets was offset by a million increase in valuation allowances 
a provision for income taxes of approximately million  or approximately of pre tax earnings  was provided in the higher than statutory effective tax rate results from the effect of certain non deductible expenses 
liquidity and capital resources the company generated million of cash and cash equivalents in the years ended december  and as reflected in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows  in  million of cash was generated from operating activities  which was up slightly from the million generated in the million  net  generated from investing activities in was lower than by approximately million as a result of fewer equipment disposals 
borrowings under the line of credit increased by over million primarily to fund principal payments on long term debt  which were million lower than  as a result of fewer company operated tractors 
the company s day to day financing is provided by borrowings under its bank credit facility 
the credit facility consists of a million term loan with a final maturity of december   and a revolving line of credit  with a maximum limit of million  which expires january  quarterly principal payments of  on the term loan are required until its maturity 
the line of credit includes provisions for the issuance of up to million in standby letters of credit which  as issued  reduce available borrowings under the line of credit 
borrowings under the line of credit are limited to amounts determined by a formula tied to the company s eligible accounts receivable and inventories  as defined in the credit facility the borrowing base 
borrowings under the revolving line of credit totaled million at december   and outstanding letters of credit totaled million at that date 
the combination of these two bank credits totaled million and  given the then existing borrowing base  left approximately million of borrowing capacity under the revolving line of credit at december  the comparable borrowing capacity under the revolving line of credit as of march   was approximately million 
the decrease in borrowing capacity from december to march  results primarily from the financing of annual license plates and permits for the company operated fleet 
the company s borrowing capacity typically is lowest in the first half of the year  and increases throughout the second half of the year 
the company was in compliance with all of its financial covenants contained in its bank credit facility during the year 
during the last quarter of  management became aware that the earnings that would be reported for would cause the company to not be in compliance with a financial covenant test contained in a mortgage loan to one of the operating subsidiaries for december   and later periods 
management requested that the lender waive noncompliance with this provision  and establish a new covenant test 
subsequent to year end  the company and the lender executed an amendment to the agreement which waives noncompliance with such test and establishes a new test which management believes the company will be able to meet for the remaining term of the loan 
the company currently believes that cash generated from operating  financing and investing activities and cash available to it under the bank credit facility will be sufficient to meet the company s needs during other factors 
inflation can be expected to have an impact on most of the company s operating costs although the impact of inflation in recent years has been minimal 
changes in market interest rates can be expected to impact the company to the extent that revenue equipment is added and replaced and because the company s lease rates and bank financing is related to market interest rates 
the trucking industry is generally affected by customer business cycles and by seasonality 
revenues are also affected by inclement weather and holidays because revenues are directly related to available working days of shippers 
customers typically reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season 
the company s revenues tend to follow this pattern and are strongest in the summer months 
generally  the second and third calendar quarters have higher load bookings than the fourth and first calendar quarters 
new accounting pronouncements in june   the fasb issued sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income which establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components 
the fasb also issued sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information which establishes standards for reporting information on operating segments 
these statements are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  at this time  the company has not determined the impact of these statements on its disclosures 
year the company has assessed  and continues to assess  the impact of the year issue on its reporting systems and operations 
the year issue exists because many computer systems and applications currently use two digit date fields to designate a year 
as the century date occurs  date sensitive systems will recognize the year as or not at all 
this inability to recognize or properly treat the year may cause our systems to process critical financial and operational information incorrectly 
one of the more significant year issues faced by the company are the systems in place within the company s dispatch and equipment control system  which are not year compliant 
as a result  in the company is updating and working with the vendors of any products it is using to install and modify all of its applications and computer systems and  in particular  its dispatch and equipment control system to insure that they will be year compliant 
all programs are expected to be fully tested and problems resolved by june  the company does not expect the costs associated with becoming year compliant to be material
