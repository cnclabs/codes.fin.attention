item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company intends to offset this downward pressure on its traditional product revenue in two ways 
first  the company has announced its intention to release new versions of its traditional products  providing additional functionality  year compliance and error corrections 
second  interleaf intends to emphasize the delivery of its products and consulting services as an integrated package  and the company is considering an outsourcing approach to sales  where interleaf would take responsibility for all aspects of its traditional customers technical document production process 
new product development the software industry is characterized by rapid technological change  which requires the continuing enhancement of existing products and development of new products 
in fiscal  as the internet and intranets grew in the marketplace  the company developed the interleaf xtreme product line to enable its customers to distribute their information via the internet and corporate intranets 
after extensive market research and planning  interleaf has started to shift its corporate strategy towards an emerging market  called content management 
this market will enable interleaf to leverage its technology expertise including its new xtreme product line  custom application development experience and customer base 
content management solutions enable a customer to break down its information into reusable units  and to re use and re purpose those information units in its documents both electronic and paper using structure and intelligence which reflect the needs and business processes of the customer and its extended enterprise 
industry analysts including gartner group  meta group and cap ventures have identified content management as the sharing of information across extended enterprises via the internet and corporate intranets  which are fast becoming the information backbone in most organizations 
cap ventures estimates the content management market size was approximately million in calendar year  and is growing at compound annual growth rate 
last year  interleaf saw many of its customers accelerate the use of the company s internet based products to distribute many different types of information via corporate intranets a trend that the company expects will increase rapidly during the coming year 
while interleaf currently offers powerful products to enable on demand assembly and intranet distribution of documents  a new digital standard  extensible markup language xml  is emerging to facilitate wider and more effective information sharing 
xml adds structure  intelligence and formatting to document based information so the information can be distilled  cataloged and reused within companies and between business partners 
xml will enable the delivery of just in time  customized documents through the assembly of small  easily identifiable and compatible information components  or elements 
xml also enables document to document information processing  which will facilitate electronic commerce 
in early interleaf announced the development of a prototype xml product  which is code named bladerunner  and which is scheduled for general release during the calendar year 
bladerunner  in addition to i  will support microsoft word as the primary user authoring environment  and enable the creation and sharing of xml document elements without requiring a technical knowledge of xml 
these features are critical to the wide adoption of bladerunner and interleaf s content management solution  because users will expect to create new content and assemble custom documents within a familiar authoring environment

as a strategy to increase revenue from sales of its traditional products  the company is increasing its promotion of turnkey solutions 
interleaf is also considering an outsourcing model  where interleaf would take responsibility for all aspects of the technical document production process 
the company is currently establishing an outsourcing capability to offer to its customers  and may consider seeking partnership opportunities with established outsourcing companies 
interleaf s solutions based approach to sales is also a key aspect of the company s content management strategy 
the company believes that  due to the complexity of content management and the early stage of this market and its technology and standards  the successful implementation of a content management solution will necessarily require a relatively large component of services

technical support and training 
interleaf offers its customers maintenance contracts that currently provide them with software upgrades  bug fixes and technical support 
interleaf operates two main technical support centers one at its corporate headquarters in the united states and the other  providing european wide support  in germany 
smaller support centers are also located in australia and japan 
the company also markets a wide variety of training courses to help customers use the interleaf tools quickly and effectively 
training is performed on a global basis at interleaf facilities  satellite locations and customer sites 
markets and customers 
interleaf has historically directed its marketing efforts primarily to the technical documentation segment of the electronic publishing market 
its customers are among the largest and most highly regarded companies in a wide range of markets both  including process and discrete manufacturing  financial services  government and transportation 
the company has decided to more closely focus in the future on selected vertical markets  including manufacturing and the financial services market 
the company s installed base asset provides a strong point of departure as it moves to establishing itself as a leading content management supplier to the manufacturing and financial services markets 
sales and distribution united states 
in the united states  interleaf distributes its software products and consulting services primarily through direct field sales and telesales representatives to large corporations 
direct channel 
currently  the company sells its software products and consulting services to large organizations primarily through a direct field sales force assigned to regional and named account territories  and through a telesales operation that supports the direct sales force 
in fiscal  interleaf plans to focus much of its direct sales force on selling to large manufacturers  which make up the largest portion of its installed base 
the company also operates a dedicated telesales organization to market its complex publishing products and maintenance services to its installed base of customers 
interleaf maintains sales and service offices in five united states locations 
alternate channels 
the company has agreements with a limited number of value added resellers vars to market and distribute its software products 
during the past three fiscal years  domestic revenues attributable to var sales were not significant 
as part of its content management strategy moving forward  the company will actively pursue distribution partnerships with solution providers who offer domain knowledge  vertical market application expertise and who have an established market presence in their area of concentration 
international 
the company primarily markets its software products and services in canada  europe and asia through its wholly owned subsidiaries in australia  canada  france  germany  japan and the united kingdom 
in italy  interleaf products are sold exclusively through interleaf italia srl the company has an equity interest of approximately in interleaf italia srl from through june   interleaf had been selling its products in latin america through an exclusive distributor 
the company has repurchased the distribution rights and is now selling directly in latin america 
the revenues from interleaf americas and latin america have been insignificant 
interleaf s operations in japan and australia have experienced a decrease in revenue  which is due in part to the general economic downturn in japan and the asia pacific region 
this economic downturn has affected the purchasing power and patterns of interleaf s customers  which in turn affects interleaf s revenue in the region 
manufacturing the company outsources its manufacturing operations  which include the duplication of tapes  diskettes  cds  and printed documents  assembling  and final packaging 
backlog the company generally manufactures its software on the basis of its forecast of near term demand and generally ships to end users within thirty days after receipt of the order 
consequently  the company s product backlog is not indicative of future sales levels 
the company does not regard the amount of backlog to be material to a current understanding of its business 
the company does have a material backlog in consulting services  which represents projects which are underway or scheduled for commencement in the future 
competition the electronic publishing  distribution  viewing and document management markets are highly competitive  as is the emerging content management market 
some of the competitors are larger and have greater resources than the company 
many new competitors emerged in the electronic publishing  viewing and document management market in fiscal the introduction and market acceptance of new technologies  such as the internet and intranet  have also offered new forms of opportunity and competition for the company s existing products 
in the electronic publishing and viewing market  the company competes primarily with adobe systems inc in the document management market  the company competes with numerous companies  including documentum  inc and pc docs  inc 
principal competitive factors in these markets include product functionality  custom application development expertise  customer support  ease of use  integration  and price 
the company s products  integrated with each other  blended with specialized services  and used across different hardware platforms  are its principal competitive advantages in a market that is fragmented with many companies offering only separate parts of a solution 
the company also believes that its ability to provide content management solutions for customer specific business problems will increasingly distinguish the company from its competitors 
research and development the company spent million on research and development in fiscal this amount was spent on the continued enhancement of the company s existing products  and the development of new products 
employees as of march   the company  worldwide  employed full time employees  of whom were employed in research and development  which includes quality assurance and technical documentation  in domestic sales operations  including services  in domestic customer support  in corporate marketing  in finance and administration  and in the company s international operations 
the company s success will depend in large part on its ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  who are in demand throughout the industry 
none of the company s employees are represented by a labor union 
interleaf believes that its employee relations are good 
product protection the company relies on a combination of trade secret  patent  copyright and trademark laws  license agreements and technical measures to protect its rights in and to its software 
however  for the reasons discussed below under risk factors dependence on proprietary technology  and due to rapid technological change in the software industry  the company believes that patent  trade secret and copyright protection are less significant than factors such as the knowledge  ability and experience of employees as well as name recognition 
the company obtained us patent no 
 covering an extensible electronic document processing system for creating new classes of active documents  which provides the company with exclusive rights to certain inventions which are reduced to practice in its i and rdm products 
the company has obtained trademark registrations of interleaf in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions 
in addition  i  i  i  worldview  rdm  businessweb  xtreme and bladerunner are trademarks of the company 
aside from its patent rights as described above  the company relies primarily on copyright laws of the united states and other jurisdictions  and on written software license agreements  to protect its intellectual property rights in its software products 
although the company s license agreements prohibit both the unauthorized use  copying or distribution of the company s products  and the disclosure of the proprietary aspects of its products  it is technically possible for competitors to copy aspects of its products in violation of the company s rights 
item properties the company s principal executive  administrative and research and development operations are located in two adjacent buildings  cumulatively totaling approximately  square feet in waltham  massachusetts  both of which the company occupies under leases expiring in november and december the company also leases sales and support offices in five locations in the united states and six foreign locations for its subsidiaries

 accounting for income taxes  effective april  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information provided below contains forward looking information 
the company s actual future results may differ materially from the projections or suggestions made in such forward looking information and may fluctuate between operating periods 
certain factors that might cause such differences and fluctuations include the factors discussed below under risk factors 
results of operations overview the company reported net income of million on total revenues of million in fiscal this compares with a net loss of million on revenues of million  and net income of million on revenues of million in fiscal and  respectively 
much of the decline in total revenue during the periods is due to a decrease in product revenue  and the related impact on maintenance and service revenue caused by the ongoing maturation of the market for complex authoring products and the increasing popularity of low end versions of windows based authoring software 
the company has continued its efforts in fiscal to focus on developing and supporting a new family of publishing products xtreme based on internet technologies  targeted toward its customers extended enterprise 
the return to profitability in fiscal was primarily due to the impact of significant reductions to the cost structure of the company during the second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal during these three quarters of fiscal  headcount was reduced  facilities were closed or downsized  and various cost control measures were implemented 
in early  interleaf entered the content management marketplace  an emerging market centered around the disassembly and re purposing of information at a reusable unit level  and improving information sharing through the internet and corporate intranets 
the company intends to introduce content management products in this market during fiscal revenues product in the fiscal years ended march   and  worldwide product revenues were million  million  and million  respectively  representing  and  respectively  of the company s total revenues 
there was a decrease in total product revenue of million in fiscal from fiscal  and a decrease of million in fiscal from fiscal revenue declined in all geographic regions 
the continued decline in product license revenue was due to the following factors 
the first factor was the increasing popularity of windows based publishing software 
second  there was considerable consolidation in the aerospace defense industry  where the company had historically derived most of its authoring product license revenue 
in addition  this industry became saturated with high end authoring software 
the company is refocusing its business strategy on providing a new family of content management products targeted toward specific vertical markets 
while the company has built well accepted integrated document publishing solutions for individual customers  it has not yet demonstrated the ability to develop  market and sell content management products 
there is no assurance that the company will be successful in implementing this strategy 
therefore  the company is unable to predict if or when product revenues will stabilize or grow 
additionally  since the company s services and maintenance revenues are largely dependent on new product licenses  these revenue components have also experienced downward pressure  which may continue 
maintenance in the fiscal years ended march   and  worldwide maintenance revenues were million  million  and million  respectively  representing  and  respectively  of the company s total revenues 
there was a decrease in total maintenance revenue of million in fiscal from fiscal  and a decrease of million in fiscal from fiscal revenue declined in all geographic regions 
future maintenance revenue is dependent on the company s ability to maintain its existing customer base  to release new versions of its traditional products  and to increase maintenance contract volume related to the new content management products 
services services revenue consists of revenue from consulting and customer training 
during the fiscal years ended march   and  worldwide revenues from services were approximately million  million  and million respectively  representing approximately  and respectively  of the company s total revenues 
there was a decrease in services revenue of million in fiscal from fiscal  and a decrease of million in fiscal from fiscal service revenue declined in all geographic regions 
future services revenue is dependent on the company s ability to maintain its existing customer base and to increase consulting and training contracts based on the successful introduction of new products 
north america revenues in north america were approximately million  million  and million of total revenues during fiscal   and  respectively 
the decline in fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in product license and maintenance revenues 
the decline in fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in product license and consulting revenues 
international revenues from the company s international operations were approximately million  million  and million during fiscal   and respectively 
the declines in fiscal and fiscal were primarily due to lower product revenue compared to the prior fiscal years 
fiscal during fiscal  the company plans to develop and release several upgrades to its traditional products 
the company also plans to develop product offerings which address at least two vertical segments of the content management market 
growth in revenues during fiscal and fiscal will be largely dependent on the introduction and customer acceptance of the new and enhanced software products planned to be released in fiscal and the following year  and the company s success in leveraging software products with services to provide web based content management solutions to its customers  improving sales force productivity and the effectiveness of the company s investment in marketing and lead generation programs 
if the company is unable to grow or stabilize its revenues in fiscal  further expense reductions will be necessary in order to sustain operations 
costs of revenues cost of product revenues includes amortization of capitalized software development costs  product media  documentation materials  packaging and shipping costs  and royalties paid for licensed technology 
in the fiscal years ended march   and  worldwide cost of product revenues were million  million and million  respectively  representing  and  respectively  of the company s total product revenues 
total cost of product revenue decreased by million in fiscal from fiscal  and there was an increase of million in fiscal from fiscal the increase in costs of product revenues from fiscal to fiscal  and the decline the following year is due to a write off of capitalized software development costs that occurred in fiscal  and the lower annual amortization that resulted in fiscal this write off was related to the company s fiscal restructuring 
in the fiscal years ended march   and  worldwide cost of maintenance revenues were million  million and million  respectively  representing  and respectively  of the company s total maintenance revenues 
total cost of maintenance revenue decreased by 
million in fiscal from fiscal  and by 
million in fiscal from fiscal the major reason for the decreases was a reduction in customer support personnel associated with the fiscal year and restructuring 
in the fiscal years ended march   and  worldwide cost of services revenue were million  million and million  respectively  representing  and  respectively  of the company s total services revenue 
total cost of services revenue decreased by million in fiscal from fiscal  and by million in fiscal from fiscal the decreases in both fiscal and fiscal from fiscal were related to the decline in product and services revenues  and the fiscal year restructuring 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative sg a sg a expenses decreased by million in fiscal from fiscal  and by million in fiscal from fiscal the decline was primarily due to significant personnel and facilities expense reductions related to the company s fiscal and restructurings 
research and development r d r d expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses to support product development net of by capitalized software development costs 
during the fiscal years ended march   and  the company s product development and engineering expenses  including the amortization of software development costs  were approximately million  million  and million respectively  representing  and respectively  of the company s total revenues 
r d expenses decreased by million in fiscal from fiscal  and by million in fiscal from there were no software development costs capitalized in fiscal income taxes in fiscal  an alternative minimum tax provision was provided 
for fiscal year  no tax provision was required due to the losses sustained during the year 
in fiscal  the effective tax rate was reduced by net operating loss carryforwards 
the company has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million in several tax jurisdictions to offset future taxable income 
in addition  the company has tax credit carryforwards of approximately million to offset federal and state income tax liabilities 
therefore  the company expects to pay minimal income taxes for the foreseeable future 
liquidity and capital resources the company had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents at march   an increase of approximately million from march  the net increase was the result of million in cash received from the private placement described below and in note to the consolidated financial statements  partially offset by million in restructuring payments as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
at march  and march   the company had approximately million of cash restricted for potential payment of a withholding tax assessment on its german subsidiary related to payments remitted to the united states from germany in the company is appealing this assessment 
on september   the company completed a private placement resulting in net proceeds to the company of million from the issuance of  shares of convertible preferred stock and placement agent warrants to purchase additional shares of convertible preferred stock 
see risk factors and note to the consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended march   the company paid approximately million  net of sublease receipts  related to the fiscal and restructurings  compared to million paid during the same period in fiscal cash payments related to these restructurings  the majority of which are related to operating lease payments  net of subleases  are anticipated to continue until december all significant vacant space under lease has been subleased 
in august  the company s revolving line of credit and million equipment letter of credit with a major commercial lender expired 
this revolving line of credit was never utilized in either fiscal or  but any borrowed amounts would have been secured by substantially all domestic assets of the company 
at march   the company has obtained from another major commercial lender a new equipment letter of credit for million  which is secured by the equivalent amount of cash 
during fiscal year  the company experienced a substantial decline in revenues and a substantial loss from operations which resulted in a shareholders deficit at march  in response to the downward trend in revenues  management took appropriate expense control actions relating to operations  which restored the company to profitability through fiscal while the company showed a modest profit in fiscal  no assurances can be given that profitable operations can be sustained 
management is committed to taking all appropriate and necessary actions to effect timely cost reductions in the event that anticipated revenue levels are not achieved 
the company believes its current cash balances and cash generated from operations  offset by restructuring payments  will be sufficient to meet the company s liquidity needs for fiscal the company has undertaken a comprehensive evaluation of its internal information systems in order to evaluate those modifications which will be required in order to address year functionality and other operational deficiencies 
this review is substantially complete  and the company has estimated that the cost or risk which may be associated with its year or other internal operational issues is not material 
the company expects to upgrade certain hardware and software during the next fiscal year in order to become compliant 
the estimated cost of these upgrades is less than 
million 
risk factors the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business 
declining revenue and mature product market 
since the company s inception  it has focused primarily on the development and marketing of electronic publishing software for the technical documentation marketplace 
the market for high end technical publishing and document management software has matured and is largely saturated 
the decline in revenue over recent years is due to the decrease in product revenue and related maintenance and service revenue caused by maturation of the market for these products  and the increased popularity of low cost versions of windows based authoring software 
unless the company develops new products and markets  revenues could be expected to continue to decline 
dependence on new products and emerging markets 
the company s strategy for future growth will depend  in significant part  on the successful development  introduction and customer acceptance of new and enhanced products  particularly content management products and services 
new markets in the software industry are characterized by evolving industry standards  rapid technological change  unknown and changing customer requirements  all of which may cause delays in development or market acceptance of the company s new products 
in addition  the market for content management products and services is just beginning to emerge  is intensely competitive  highly fragmented and subject to rapid change 
there can be no assurance that the content management market will coalesce and continue to grow  that the company will successfully develop content management software or that such software will be accepted in the marketplace 
uncertainty of future operating results  fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
future operating results will depend upon many factors  including the demand for the company s existing products  the ability of the company to develop and market new products  market acceptance of the company s new products  the timing of new product introductions and product enhancements by the company and its competitors  the level of product and price competition  the length of the company s sales cycle  the size and timing of individual license transactions  the delay or deferral of customer implementation of new software and services  the budget cycles of the company s customers  the mix of products and services sold  activities of competitors  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and general domestic and international economic and political conditions 
the company typically ships a substantial amount of its products in the final weeks  or even days  of each quarter 
certain of these end of quarter license sales may reflect a relatively high amount of revenues per order  and the loss or delay of individual orders could have a significant impact on the revenues and quarterly results of the company 
in addition  the timing of license revenue is difficult to predict because of the length of the company s sales cycle 
because the company s operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue trends and because a high percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  any shortfall from anticipated revenue or a delay in the recognition of revenue from a limited number of license transactions could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
as a result of these factors  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is likely that in some quarters the company s operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
in such event  the market price of the company s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
intense competition 
the market for the company s existing technical documentation products is intensely competitive  subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
several competitors have greater market penetration and acceptance  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  significantly greater name recognition and a larger installed base of customers than the company 
while it is not yet clear who the company s competitors will be in the emerging content management market  it is likely that competition will be intense in that market also 
reliance on certain relationships 
the company is seeking to establish strategic relationships with companies with outsourcing or service bureau businesses  and with companies that have presence and publishing expertise in the financial services market 
the company has relationships with various technology providers  including microsoft corporation and microstar software  ltd  which are important to the company s entrance into the content management market 
all of these relationships will be important to the company s worldwide sales  marketing and support activities 
the failure of the company to establish and or maintain these relationships  or to establish additional future relationships have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence upon key personnel 
the company s ability to compete effectively will require the company to train and manage its employee work force 
competition for qualified personnel in the software industry is very intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract  assimilate or retain key employees 
see business employees 
dependence on proprietary technology  risks of infringement 
the company s success is heavily dependent upon proprietary technology 
the company relies primarily on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  patents  contractual provisions and technical measures to protect its proprietary rights 
the company seeks to protect its software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection 
despite the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of the company s products or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of the company s products is difficult  and while the company is unable to determine the extent to which piracy of its software products exists  some software piracy can be expected 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
there can be no assurance that the company s means of protecting its proprietary rights will be adequate or that the company s competitors will not independently develop similar technology 
the company is not aware that any of its products infringe the proprietary rights of third parties 
there can be no assurance  however  that third parties will not claim infringement by the company with respect to current or future products 
any such claims could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require the company to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements 
risks of dilution 
the company issued in september shares of series d preferred stock  which are convertible into shares of common stock  as described below in notes to consolidated financial statements note 
given the recent trading volume of the common stock on the nasdaq national market system  the conversion of series d shares into common stock  and the subsequent sale of such newly issued common stock over a short period of time would cause significant downward pressure on the price of the company s common stock 
while as of march  the conversion of series d shares would have been anti dilutive  such conversion will be dilutive in the future 
in june   of the series d shares  shares  including shares issuable upon exercise of the placement agent warrants were eligible for conversion into approximately  shares of common stock  representing potential dilution of approximately 
in october   all of the series d shares become convertible 
assuming that the company s stock price remains stable at its june level  in october the series d shares will be convertible into shares of common stock representing potential dilution of approximately 
in the event that all or a significant portion of the series d shares are converted into shares of common stock  and sold on the nasdaq national market system over a relatively short period of time  the market price of the company s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note and note 
product liability year the company has undertaken a systematic review and planning process concerning the requirements and abilities of its standard products including embedded third party products to handle date information and to function appropriately from and after january  the company intends to discontinue its support of certain products which it considers obsolete without regard to year concerns 
although the company believes that the effort required to adapt its supported standard products to the year will not have a materially adverse impact on the company s financial performance  currently unforeseen difficulties  delays or requirements could cause this assessment to change 
many of the company s customers have implemented custom applications which rely on the company s standard products to operate  and the company does not believe that it has the obligation to modify those applications for the year it is possible that unforeseen liabilities may arise with respect to discontinued products or custom applications 
risks associated with acquisitions 
as part of its business strategy  the company is investigating the possibility of making acquisitions of  or significant investments in  businesses that offer complementary products and technologies
