item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s strategy is concentrated on three components of its business loan production  loan servicing and businesses ancillary to mortgage lending 
see business mortgage banking operations and business other operations 
the company intends to continue its efforts to increase its market share of  and realize increased income from  its loan production 
in addition  the company is engaged in building its loan servicing portfolio because of the returns it can earn from such investment 
a strong production capability and a growing servicing portfolio are the primary means used by the company to reduce the sensitivity of its earnings to changes in interest rates because the effect of interest rate changes on loan production income is counter cyclical to their effect on servicing income 
finally  the company is involved in business activities complementary to its mortgage banking business 
these services include acting as agent in the sale of insurance  including homeowners  fire  flood  earthquake  life and disability  providing various title insurance agent and escrow services  offering appraisal and credit reporting services  brokering servicing contracts and trading mortgage backed securities mbs and other mortgage related assets 
the company s results of operations historically have been primarily influenced by i the level of demand for mortgage credit  which is affected by such external factors as the level of interest rates  the strength of the various segments of the economy and the demographics of the company s lending markets  ii the direction of interest rates  and iii the relationship between mortgage interest rates and the cost of funds 
the fiscal year ended february  fiscal was a record year in profits for the company 
loan production increased to billion from billion in the fiscal year ended february  fiscal 
the company attributed the increase to i a decline in mortgage interest rates during most of the year  ii the implementation of a national advertising campaign aimed at developing a brand identity for countrywide and reaching the consumer directly  and iii the opening of two telemarketing centers which  through the use of proprietary systems  provide product information specific to the potential borrower s needs and allow a telemarketer to take a pre application and pass it to a branch office for processing 
for calendar  the company ranked second in the amount of single family mortgage originations nationwide 
in fiscal  the company s market share increased to approximately of the estimated billion single family mortgage origination market  up from approximately of the estimated billion market in fiscal the interest rate environment that prevailed during fiscal was favorable for fixed rate mortgages 
additionally  the percentage of loan production attributable to refinances increased from in fiscal to in fiscal  as borrowers took advantage of declining interest rates 
during fiscal  the company s loan servicing portfolio grew to billion from billion at february  this growth resulted from the company s loan production during the year and bulk servicing acquisitions amounting to billion  partially offset by prepayments  partial prepayments and scheduled amortization of billion 
the prepayment rate in the servicing portfolio was  up from the prior year due to the decreasing mortgage interest rate environment in fiscal however  this rate was lower than the prepayment rate in the fiscal year ended february  fiscal because a substantial number of loans in the servicing portfolio were produced in fiscal and bear interest at rates lower than the lowest interest rate level reached during fiscal the fiscal year ended february  fiscal was a period in which interest rates were somewhat volatile  generally higher than during the previous fiscal year but at levels that remained conducive to certain refinance and home purchase activity 
the company s earnings increased from fiscal loan production increased to billion from billion in the prior year 
the company attributed the increase in production to i the generally strong economy and home purchase market  ii the continued implementation of a national advertising campaign  which was started in fiscal  aimed at developing a brand identity for countrywide and reaching the consumer directly  and iii the integration of home equity and sub prime lending into the company s product offerings and production capacity 
for calendar  the company ranked second in the amount of single family mortgage originations nationwide 
the company s market share for both fiscal and was approximately of the estimated billion and billion  respectively  single family mortgage origination market 
during fiscal  the company s loan servicing portfolio grew to billion from billion at the end of fiscal this growth resulted from the company s loan production during the year and bulk servicing acquisitions amounting to billion  partially offset by prepayments  partial prepayments and scheduled amortization of billion 
the prepayment rate in the servicing portfolio was  slightly down from the prior year due to the higher mortgage interest rate environment in fiscal the fiscal year ended february  fiscal was a record year from ongoing operations in revenues and net earnings for the company 
loan production increased to billion from billion in the prior year 
the company attributed the increase in production to i lower interest rates  ii the generally strong economy and home purchase market  iii the continued implementation of a national advertising campaign  which was started in fiscal  aimed at developing a brand identity for countrywide and reaching the consumer directly  and iv increased consumer markets and wholesale branch networks  including the new retail sub prime branches 
for calendar  the company ranked second in the amount of single family mortgage originations nationwide 
the company s market share for both fiscal and fiscal was approximately of the estimated billion and billion  respectively  single family mortgage origination market 
during fiscal  the company s loan servicing portfolio grew to billion from billion at the end of fiscal this growth resulted from the company s loan production during the year and bulk servicing acquisitions amounting to billion  partially offset by prepayments  partial prepayments and scheduled amortization of billion 
the prepayment rate in the servicing portfolio was  up from the prior year due to the lower mortgage interest rate environment in fiscal on july   the company and inmc mortgage holdings  inc formerly cwm mortgage holdings  inc inmc concluded the restructuring of their business relationship 
in substance  inmc acquired the assets  operations and employees of its former manager camc  formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
inmc no longer pays management fees to camc 
in return  the company received  newly issued common shares of inmc 
these shares were restricted at issuance for up to a period of three years 
the transaction was structured as a merger of camc with and into inmc 
results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal revenues from ongoing operations for fiscal increased to  million from  million for fiscal net earnings from ongoing operations increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal both revenues and net earnings from ongoing operations for fiscal exclude a nonrecurring pre tax gain of million on the sale of a subsidiary 
the increase in revenues and net earnings from ongoing operations for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to a larger gain on sale of loans resulting from greater sales of higher margin home equity loans and sub prime loans in fiscal at significantly higher margins than prime credit quality first mortgages  improved pricing margins on prime credit quality first mortgages  an increase in the size of the company s servicing portfolio  higher loan production volume and an increase in the income of the non mortgage banking subsidiaries 
these positive factors were partially offset by an increase in amortization of the servicing asset and an increase in expenses in fiscal over fiscal the total volume of loans produced increased to billion for fiscal from billion for fiscal the increase in loan production was primarily due to generally lower interest rates that prevailed during fiscal compared to fiscal  as well as to the continuing expansion of the company s consumer markets and wholesale lending divisions  including the new retail sub prime branches 
refinancings totaled billion  or of total fundings  for fiscal  as compared to billion  or of total fundings  for fiscal fixed rate mortgage loan production totaled billion  or of total fundings  for fiscal  as compared to billion  or of total fundings  for fiscal total loan volume in the company s production divisions is summarized below 
dollar amounts in millions loan production fiscal fiscal consumer markets division   wholesale lending division   correspondent lending division   full spectrum lending  inc total loan volume   the factors which affect the relative volume of production among the company s divisions include the price competitiveness of each division s product offerings  the level of mortgage lending activity in each division s market and the success of each division s sales and marketing efforts 
included in the company s total volume of loans produced is billion of home equity loans funded in fiscal and million funded in fiscal sub prime loan production  which is also included in the company s total production volume  was billion in fiscal and million in fiscal at february  and  the company s pipeline of loans in process was billion and billion  respectively 
historically  approximately to of the pipeline of loans in process has funded 
in addition  at february   the company had committed to make loans in the amount of billion  subject to property identification and approval of the loans the lock n shop r pipeline 
at february   the lock n shop r pipeline was billion 
in fiscal and fiscal  the company received  and  new loan applications  respectively  at an average daily rate of million and million  respectively 
the factors that affect the percentage of applications received and funded during a given time period include the movement and direction of interest rates  the average length of loan commitments issued  the creditworthiness of applicants  the production divisions loan processing efficiency and loan pricing decisions 
loan origination fees increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to higher production 
the percentage increase in loan origination fees was more than the increase in production 
this is primarily because production by the consumer markets and wholesale lending divisions which  due to their higher cost structure  charge higher origination fees per dollar loaned comprised a greater percentage of total production in fiscal than in fiscal gain on sale of loans improved in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to greater sales during fiscal of higher margin home equity and sub prime loans and improved pricing margins on prime credit quality first mortgages 
the sale of home equity loans contributed million and million to gain on sale of loans in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
sub prime loans contributed million to the gain on sale of loans in fiscal and million in fiscal in general  loan origination fees and gain loss on sale of loans are affected by numerous factors including the volume and mix of loans produced and sold  loan pricing decisions  interest rate volatility and the general direction of interest rates 
net interest income interest earned net of interest charges decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal net interest income is principally a function of i net interest income earned from the company s mortgage loan warehouse million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  ii interest expense related to the company s investment in servicing rights million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively and iii interest income earned from the custodial balances associated with the company s servicing portfolio million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the company earns interest on  and incurs interest expense to carry  mortgage loans held in its warehouse 
the increase in net interest income from the mortgage loan warehouse was primarily attributed to higher production levels partially resulting from aggregating home equity and sub prime loans which generally bear interest at higher rates than prime credit quality first mortgages prior to their sale or securitization 
the increase in interest expense on the investment in servicing rights resulted primarily from a larger servicing portfolio and an increase in the payments of interest to certain investors pursuant to customary servicing arrangements with regard to paid off loans in excess of the interest earned on these loans through their respective payoff dates interest costs incurred on payoffs 
the increase in net interest income earned from the custodial balances was related to an increase in the average custodial balances caused by growth of the servicing portfolio and an increase in the amount of prepayments  combined with an increase in the earnings rate from fiscal to fiscal during fiscal  loan administration income was positively affected by the continued growth of the loan servicing portfolio 
at february   the company serviced billion of loans including billion of loans subserviced for others  compared to billion including billion of loans subserviced for others at february   a increase 
the growth in the company s servicing portfolio during fiscal was the result of loan production volume and the acquisition of bulk servicing rights  partially offset by prepayments  partial prepayments and scheduled amortization of mortgage loans 
the weighted average interest rate of the mortgage loans in the company s servicing portfolio at both february  and was 
it is the company s strategy to build and retain its servicing portfolio because of the returns the company can earn from such investment and because the company believes that servicing income is counter cyclical to loan production income 
see prospective trends market factors 
during fiscal  the prepayment rate of the company s servicing portfolio was  compared to for fiscal in general  the prepayment rate is affected by the level of refinance activity  which in turn is driven by the relative level of mortgage interest rates  and activity in the home purchase market 
the increase in the prepayment rate from fiscal to fiscal was primarily attributable to the increase in refinance activity caused by lower interest rates during fiscal than during fiscal the primary means used by the company to reduce the sensitivity of its earnings to changes in interest rates is through a strong production capability and a growing servicing portfolio 
in addition  to mitigate the effect on earnings of impairment that may result from increased current and projected future prepayment activity  the company acquires financial instruments  including derivative contracts  that increase in aggregate value when interest rates decline the servicing hedge 
these financial instruments include options on interest rate futures and mbs  interest rate futures  interest rate floors  interest rate swaps with the company s maximum payment capped capped swaps  options on interest rate swaps swaptions  interest rate caps  principal only p o swaps  certain tranches of collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and options on callable pass through certificates options on cpc 
with the capped swaps  the company receives and pays interest on a specified notional amount 
the rate received is fixed  the rate paid is adjustable  is indexed to the london interbank offered rates for us dollar deposits libor and has a specified maximum or cap 
with swaps  the company receives and pays interest on a specified notional amount 
the rate received is fixed  the rate paid is adjustable and is indexed to libor 
with the swaptions  the company has the option to enter into a receive fixed  pay floating interest rate swap at a future date or to settle the transaction for cash 
with p o swaps  the value is determined by changes in the value of the referenced p o security 
the payments received by the company under the p o swaps relate to the cash flows of the referenced p o security 
the payments made by the company are based upon a notional amount tied to the remaining balance of the referenced p o security multiplied by a floating rate indexed to libor 
the cmos  which consist primarily of p o securities  have been purchased at deep discounts to their par values 
as interest rates decrease  prepayments on the collateral underlying the cmos should increase 
this should result in a decline in the average lives of the p o securities and a corresponding increase in the present values of their cash flows 
conversely  as interest rates increase  prepayments on the collateral underlying the cmos should decrease 
these changes should result in an increase in the average lives of the p o securities and a decrease in the present values of their cash flows 
an option on cpc gives the holder the right to call a mortgage backed security at par and receive the remaining cash flows from the particular pool 
this option has a one year lockout  meaning it cannot be exercised until the end of the first year 
after the lockout period  the option can be exercised at anytime 
the servicing hedge is designed to protect the value of the investment in mortgage servicing rights msrs from the effects of increased prepayment activity that generally results from declining interest rates 
to the extent that interest rates increase  the value of the msrs increases while the value of the hedge instruments declines 
with respect to the floors  options  caps  swaptions  options on cpc and cmos  the company is not exposed to loss beyond its initial outlay to acquire the hedge instruments 
the company s exposure to loss on futures is related to changes in the eurodollar rate over the life of the contract 
the company estimates that its maximum exposure to loss over the contractual term is million 
with respect to the capped swaps contracts entered into by the company as of february   the company estimates that its maximum exposure to loss over the contractual term is million 
with respect to the swap contracts entered into by the company as of february   the company estimates that its maximum exposure to loss over the contractual term is million 
in fiscal  the company recognized a net benefit of million from its servicing hedge

in fiscal  the company recognized a net expense of million from its servicing hedge 
the net expense included unrealized losses of million and net realized losses of million from the sale of various financial instruments that comprise the servicing hedge and premium amortization 
there can be no assurance that the servicing hedge will generate gains in the future  or if gains are generated  that they will fully offset impairment of the msrs 
the company recorded amortization and net impairment of its msrs for fiscal totaling million consisting of amortization amounting to million and impairment of million  compared to million of amortization and impairment consisting of amortization amounting to million and recovery of previous impairment of million for fiscal the factors affecting the amount of amortization and impairment or recovery of the msrs recorded in an accounting period include the level of prepayments during the period  the change in estimated future prepayments and the amount of servicing hedge gains or losses

in fiscal  the company s comparable pre tax earnings were million 
the increase of million was primarily attributable to a greater sale of higher margin home equity loans and sales of sub prime loans at significantly higher margins than prime credit quality first mortgages and improved pricing margins on prime credit quality first mortgages 
there were no sub prime loan sales in fiscal these positive results were partially offset by higher production costs and a change in the internal method of allocating overhead between the company s production and servicing activities 
in fiscal  the company s pre tax income from its loan servicing activities which include administering the loans in the servicing portfolio  selling homeowners and other insurance  acting as tax payment agent  marketing foreclosed properties and acting as reinsurer was million as compared to million in fiscal the increase of million was due to an increase in the size of the servicing portfolio and in the rate of servicing and miscellaneous fees earned 
largely offsetting these positive factors was an increase in the net expense resulting from amortization and impairment of msrs and from the servicing hedge from fiscal to fiscal the increase in such net expense is due primarily to increased amortization resulting from a higher cost basis in the msrs 
this higher basis is attributable to adoption of a new accounting standard effective march  that required recognition of originated mortgage servicing rights 
profitability of other activities in addition to loan production and loan servicing  the company offers ancillary products and services related to its mortgage banking activities 
these include title insurance and escrow services  home appraisals  credit cards  management of a publicly traded real estate investment trust reit  securities brokerage and servicing rights brokerage 
for fiscal  these activities contributed million to the company s pre tax income compared to million for fiscal this increase to pre tax income primarily results from improved performance of the title insurance  escrow and reit management services 
quantitative disclosure about market risk the primary market risk facing the company is interest rate risk 
from an enterprise perspective  the company manages this risk by striving to balance its loan origination and loan servicing business segments  which are counter cyclical in nature 
in addition  the company utilizes various financial instruments  including derivatives contracts  to manage the interest rate risk related specifically to its committed pipeline  mortgage loan inventory and mbs held for sale  msrs  mortgage backed securities retained in securitizations and debt securities 
the overall objective of the company s interest rate risk management policies is to offset changes in the values of these items resulting from changes in interest rates 
the company does not speculate on the direction of interest rates in its management of interest rate risk 
as part of its interest rate risk management process  the company performs various sensitivity analyses that quantify the net financial impact of changes in interest rates on its interest rate sensitive assets  liabilities and commitments 
these analyses incorporate scenarios including selected hypothetical instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve 
various modeling techniques are employed to value the financial instruments 
for mortgages  mbs and mbs forward contracts and cmos  an option adjusted spread oas model is used 
the primary assumptions used in this model are the implied market volatility of interest rates and prepayment speeds 
for options and interest rate floors  an option pricing model is used 
the primary assumption used in this model is implied market volatility of interest rates 
msrs and residual interests are valued using discounted cash flow models 
the primary assumptions used in these models are prepayment rates  discount rates and credit losses 
utilizing the sensitivity analyses described above  as of february   the company estimates that a permanent reduction in interest rates  all else being constant  would result in a million after tax loss related to its trading securities and a million after tax loss related to its other financial instruments  for the fiscal year ended february  the company estimates that this combined after tax loss of million is the largest such loss that would occur within the range of reasonably possible interest rate changes 
these sensitivity analyses are limited by the fact that they are performed at a particular point in time and do not incorporate other factors that would impact the company s financial performance in such a scenario 
consequently  the preceding estimates should not be viewed as a forecast 
inflation inflation affects the company in the areas of loan production and servicing 
interest rates normally increase during periods of high inflation and decrease during periods of low inflation 
historically  as interest rates increase  loan production  particularly from loan refinancings  decreases  although in an environment of gradual interest rate increases  purchase activity may actually be stimulated by an improving economy or the anticipation of increasing real estate values 
in such periods of reduced loan production  production margins may decline due to increased competition resulting from overcapacity in the market 
in a higher interest rate environment  servicing related earnings are enhanced because prepayment rates tend to slow down thereby extending the average life of the company s servicing portfolio and reducing amortization and impairment of the msrs  decreasing interest costs incurred on payoffs and because the rate of interest earned from the custodial balances tends to increase 
conversely  as interest rates decline  loan production  particularly from loan refinancings  increases 
however  during such periods  prepayment rates tend to accelerate principally on the portion of the portfolio having a note rate higher than the then current interest rates  thereby decreasing the average life of the company s servicing portfolio and adversely impacting its servicing related earnings primarily due to increased amortization and impairment of the msrs  a decreased rate of interest earned from the custodial balances and increased interest costs incurred on payoffs 
the impacts of changing interest rates on servicing related earnings are reduced by performance of the servicing hedge  which is designed to mitigate the impact on earnings of higher amortization and impairment that may result from declining interest rates 
seasonality the mortgage banking industry is generally subject to seasonal trends 
these trends reflect the general national pattern of sales and resales of homes  although refinancings tend to be less seasonal and more closely related to changes in interest rates 
sales and resales of homes typically peak during the spring and summer seasons and decline to lower levels from mid november through february 
in addition  delinquency rates typically rise in the winter months  which results in higher servicing costs 
however  late charge income has historically been sufficient to offset such incremental expenses 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal financing needs are the financing of loan funding activities and the investment in servicing rights 
to meet these needs  the company currently utilizes commercial paper supported by the revolving credit facility  medium term notes  mbs repurchase agreements  subordinated notes  pre sale funding facilities  an optional cash purchase feature in the dividend reinvestment plan  redeemable capital trust pass through securities and cash flow from operations 
in addition  in the past the company has utilized whole loan repurchase agreements  servicing secured bank facilities  private placements of unsecured notes and other financings  direct borrowings from the revolving credit facility and public offerings of common and preferred stock 
certain of the debt obligations of the company and countrywide home loans  inc chl contain various provisions that may affect the ability of the company and chl to pay dividends and remain in compliance with such obligations 
these provisions include requirements concerning net worth  current ratio and other financial covenants 
these provisions have not had  and are not expected to have  an adverse impact on the ability of the company and chl to pay dividends 
the company continues to investigate and pursue alternative and supplementary methods to finance its growing operations through the public and private capital markets 
these may include such methods as mortgage loan sale transactions designed to expand the company s financial capacity and reduce its cost of capital and the securitization of servicing income cash flows 
in december  countrywide capital i  a subsidiary of the company  issued million of capital trust pass through securities  and on june   countrywide capital iii  a subsidiary of the company  issued million of subordinated capital income securities  the proceeds of which were used to purchase subordinated debt securities from the company 
the company used the net proceeds from the sale of the subordinated debt securities for general corporate purposes  principally to reduce short term debt 
in connection with its derivative contracts  the company may be required to deposit cash or certain government securities or obtain letters of credit to meet margin requirements 
the company considers such potential margin requirements in its overall liquidity management 
in the course of the company s mortgage banking operations  the company sells to investors the mortgage loans it originates and purchases but generally retains the right to service the loans  thereby increasing the company s investment in loan servicing rights 
the company views the sale of loans on a servicing retained basis in part as an investment vehicle 
significant unanticipated prepayments in the company s servicing portfolio could have a material adverse effect on the company s future operating results and liquidity 
cash flows operating activities in fiscal  the company s operating activities used cash of approximately billion on a short term basis primarily to support the increase in its mortgage loans and mbs held for sale 
mortgage loans and mbs held for sale are generally financed with short term borrowings 
in fiscal  operating activities provided approximately billion on a short term basis primarily from the decrease in its mortgage loans and mbs held for sale 
in fiscal  the company s operating activities used cash of approximately billion 
investing activities the primary investing activity for which cash was used by the company was the investment in servicing 
net cash used by investing activities was billion for fiscal and billion for fiscal and fiscal financing activities net cash provided by financing activities amounted to billion for fiscal net cash used by financing activities amounted to billion for fiscal net cash provided by financing activities amounted to billion for fiscal the increase or decrease in cash flow from financing activities was primarily the result of net short term and long term debt issuance or repayment by the company 
prospective trends applications and pipeline of loans in process during fiscal  the company received new loan applications at an average daily rate of million and at february   the company s pipeline of loans in process was billion 
this compares to a daily application rate in fiscal of million and a pipeline of loans in process at february  of billion 
the size of the pipeline is generally an indication of the level of future fundings  as historically to of the pipeline of loans in process has funded 
in addition  the company s lock n shop r pipeline at february  was billion and at february  was billion 
for the month ended march   the average daily rate of applications received was million  and at march   the pipeline of loans in process was billion and the lock n shop pipeline was billion 
future application levels and loan fundings are dependent on numerous factors  including the level of demand for mortgage credit  the extent of price competition in the market  the direction of interest rates  seasonal factors and general economic conditions 
market factors loan production increased from fiscal to fiscal this increase was primarily due to several factors 
first  mortgage interest rates generally decreased in fiscal second  sub prime and home equity loan fundings  which are generally less sensitive to interest rate fluctuations than prime credit quality first mortgages  increased from fiscal to fiscal further  home purchase market activity was stronger during fiscal than in fiscal the prepayment rate in the servicing portfolio increased from fiscal to fiscal because interest rates were lower in fiscal than in fiscal the company s primary competitors are commercial banks  savings and loans  mortgage banking subsidiaries of diversified companies  as well as other mortgage bankers 
over the past three years  certain commercial banks have expanded their mortgage banking operations through acquisition of formerly independent mortgage banking companies or through internal growth 
the company believes that these transactions and activities have not had a material impact on the company or on the degree of competitive pricing in the market 
the company s california mortgage loan production measured by principal balance constituted of its total production during fiscal and during fiscal the company is continuing its efforts to expand its production capacity outside of california 
some regions in which the company operates have experienced slower economic growth  and real estate financing activity in these regions has been negatively impacted 
as a result  home lending activity for single one to four family residences in these regions may also have experienced slower growth 
to the extent that any geographic region s mortgage loan production constitutes a significant portion of the company s production  there can be no assurance that the company s operations will not be adversely affected if that region experiences slow or negative economic growth resulting in decreased residential real estate lending activity  or market factors further impact the company s competitive position in that region 
the delinquency rate in the company owned servicing portfolio increased to at february  from at february  the company believes that this increase was primarily the result of changes in portfolio mix and aging 
the proportion of government and high loan to value conventional loans  which tend to experience higher delinquency rates than low loan to value conventional loans  was of the portfolio at february  and february  in addition  the weighted average age of the portfolio is months at february   up from months at february  delinquency rates tend to increase as loans age  reaching a peak at three to five years of age 
however  because the loans in the portfolio are generally serviced on a non recourse basis  the company s exposure to credit loss resulting from increased delinquency rates is substantially limited 
further  related late charge income has historically been sufficient to offset incremental servicing expenses resulting from an increased delinquency rate 
the percentage of loans in the company s owned servicing portfolio that are in foreclosure decreased to at february  from at february  the company sold million of defaulted mortgage loans on february  see notes to the consolidated financial statements  note a  investment in non consolidated subsidiaries 
generally  the company is not exposed to credit risk 
because the company services substantially all conventional loans on a non recourse basis  foreclosure losses are generally the responsibility of the investor or insurer and not the company 
the company retains credit risk on the home equity and sub prime loans it sells in the form of pools backing securities 
as such  through retention of a subordinated interest in the trust  the company bears primary responsibility for credit losses on the loans 
at february   the company had investments in such subordinated interests amounting to million  which represents the maximum exposure to credit losses on the securitized home equity and sub prime loans 
while the company generally does not retain credit risk with respect to the prime credit quality first mortgage loans it sells  it does have potential liability under representations and warranties made to purchasers and insurers of the loans 
in the event of a breach of the representations and warranties  the company may be required to repurchase a mortgage loan and any subsequent loss on the mortgage loan may be borne by the company 
similarly  government loans serviced by the company of the company s servicing portfolio at february  are insured by the federal housing administration or partially guaranteed against loss by the department of veterans administration 
the company is exposed to credit losses to the extent that the partial guarantee provided by the department of veterans administration is inadequate to cover the total credit losses incurred 
servicing hedge as previously discussed  the company s servicing hedge is designed to protect the value of its investment in servicing rights from the effects of increased prepayment activity that generally results from declining interest rates 
in periods of increasing interest rates  the value of the servicing hedge generally declines and the value of msrs generally increases 
there can be no assurance that  in periods of increasing interest rates  the increase in value of the msrs will offset the amount of servicing hedge expense  or in periods of declining interest rates  that the company s servicing hedge will generate gains  or if gains are generated  that they will fully offset impairment of the msrs
