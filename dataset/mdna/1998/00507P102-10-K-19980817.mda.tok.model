revenues segment information actrade capital  inc and the trade acceptance draft program and ii the increased sales by its subsidiary actrade sa the increase in revenues in fiscal was the result of increased product sales by actrade sa  rather than from price increases for the company s products  and substantially increased operating revenues derived from capital 
after selling  general and administrative expenses  depreciation  interest income and expenses  and provision for taxes  including an extraordinary benefit from utilization of net operating loss carry forward  the company realized a net operating profit of  or per share  as compared to  or per share  for fiscal and  or per share  in fiscal this represented an increase in net operating profits for fiscal of approximately above fiscal during fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses continued to show a significant increase to  as compared to  for fiscal  an increase of approximately 
however  when expressed as a percentage of overall revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses represented approximately of total revenues for fiscal compared to in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal 
additionally  approximately  of this amount was due directly to capital s continued expansion of its operations  as compared to  during fiscal management projects the costs related to capital s operations will continue to escalate in fiscal  particularly as it accelerates its marketing efforts for the tad program see ii 
revenues segment information actrade capital  inc and the trade acceptance draft program 
historically  the company s net operating income  expressed as a percentage of gross revenues increased from during fiscal to a previous high of at the end of the third quarter of fiscal prior to the impact of the costs associated with capital s operations 
as had been expected  following the introduction of capital s tad program  this ratio fell to its all time low of at the end of fiscal  but began to recover significantly in fiscal when it rose to at the end of fiscal  at the end of fiscal and during fiscal during fiscal  due principally to significantly increased revenues from capital s tad program and actrade sa  and despite the substantial increased costs of capital s expansion program  this ratio continued its upward trend and  at the end of fiscal  reached an all time high of 
although only slightly higher than fiscal  this ratio confirmed management s belief that there would be leveling off during fiscal  due to the anticipated balance between the cost of its accelerated marketing program and the expected increased revenues from capital s operations 
with the substantial expansion costs expected to be incurred in connection with the company s tad program  both domestically and internationally  management does not expect any significant change  either up or down  in this ratio during fiscal since fiscal  management has defer any expansion of allstate s operations due primarily to the concentration of its personnel and resources in the import export business of actrade and  more recently  in the development of the tad program 
in light of management s continued emphasis in these areas and the expansion of capital s tad program  management does not anticipate any significant change in the level of operations of allstate 
during fiscal  allstate s total sales aggregated only  which represented only a very slight increase in gross revenues from fiscal  and accounted for less than of of the company s total revenues 
as of june   of the company s total trade accounts receivable in the amount of  approximately have been collected as of the date of this report and  of the balance  approximately  are secured by commercial documentary drafts  and approximately  are open account 
this does not include  in trade acceptance drafts receivable which have been sold to an independent financial institution and  in trade acceptance drafts held by the company

revenue segment information 
until fiscal  the company s revenues were comprised solely of export sales by actrade and revenues earned by allstate s travel agency business 
during fiscal the company  through capital  realized the first revenues from its newly introduced tad program 
since its introduction  capital s revenues have continued to increase to the point where it now constitutes the single largest revenue segment for the company 
see discussion immediately below 
actrade capital inc and the trade acceptance draft program 
following a complete revision of the operating plan for capital in late fiscal  management developed new trade financing programs intended to be marketed to domestic companies in the united states 
management believed that a strong demand for new  innovative trade financing methods exists among american companies 
in late fiscal  capital offered its first financial program to assist companies in the management and collection of small open accounts receivable the tad program 
during fiscal  the first full year of operations for this program  although still in its development stage  capital generated gross revenues of  with a net loss from its operations of  although showing a modest loss  capital s operating results for fiscal exceeded management s expectations 
during fiscal  management decided to implement an aggressive new marketing plan for the tad program  principally in response to the perceived need to educate potential participants in the program about how trade acceptances work and how they could benefit from the tad program 
as a result  revenues from the tad program have increased steadily and significantly each year since it was first introduced 
during fiscal  ended june   capital generated gross revenues of  over higher that fiscal  with direct general and administrative expenses of  an increase of almost over fiscal the dramatic increase in both gross revenues and general and administrative expenses during fiscal were the direct result of management s aggressive expansion of its marketing efforts for its tad program which began during fiscal  including the initiation of international operations 
for fiscal  capital s operations reflected a gross profit of  up almost from fiscal  with net pre tax income of  up more than over fiscal

and actrade sa  ltd 
the international trade division 
during fiscal  the company s four principal overseas markets continued to be i the middle east  ii south america iii europe including eastern europe and iv the pacific rim 
during fiscal  the company showed increased revenues in all four of these primary markets 
the increase experienced in the european area  where sales jumped to  higher than fiscal  was due principally to continued strong demand for computers in eastern europe and the continued increased sales of bard air conditioning units for the tele communications industry in europe 
the company also posted increases of over in its south american market  almost in its middle east market and almost in the far east 
the most significant increase in any single market occurred in the united states  due to the substantial increase in revenues earned by capital  where total us sales increased by approximately over fiscal the following table illustrates the company s gross revenues by market segment during the past four fiscal years market segment amount of revenues for fiscal year by area middle east     south america     europe     far east     united states     all others    see financial statements note foreign and domestic operations and export sales 
management plans to utilize current cash on hand in connection with its international trading operations principally for i general working capital reserves to meet any extraordinary or unexpected expenses  ii and to collateralize interim financing  if required  in connection with actrade s export operations 
management has  in many cases  utilized assignments of letters of credit from overseas buyers to american manufacturers in payment for products 
although this procedure has been acceptable to most suppliers  with respect to new suppliers or for small purchase orders  this assignment procedure may not be acceptable in the future and the company may be required to utilize available cash 
to date  it has not been necessary to use available cash for this purpose and management does not foresee the need for such financing in the future 
see business operations 
during fiscal  ended june   sales by actrade sa totaled  or of the company s total gross revenues  as compared to  or of the company s total gross revenues for fiscal and  or for fiscal the increase in gross revenues for actrade sa resulted primarily from the sale of computer systems and related equipment  which represents the culmination of a long term effort to open the developing markets of eastern europe and the former soviet union 
by opening these markets over the past few years  actrade sa has also solidified it s effort to develop reliable sources for computer systems and hardware 
however  because of the continued volatile economic and political changes in the world  and particularly in eastern europe where actrade sa made a significant portion of its sales during fiscal  it remains virtually impossible to accurately project revenues for actrade sa during fiscal however  although no assurances can be given  in management s opinion  revenues are expected to continue at approximately the levels experienced during fiscal and the operations of actrade sa will continue to be an important aspect of the company s overall operations for the foreseeable future 
the most significant factor which continues to impact the growth of actrade sa is the continued economic and political instability among the many new  developing nations of the world 
management believes that  as many of these new and developing countries stabilize their internal political and economic conditions  provided that individual currencies can also be stabilized to permit participation in the international markets  the demand for commercial and consumer products will increase  a factor expected to benefit actrade  sa in the future 
another factor which management believes will favor the continued growth of actrade sa has been the improved economic environment in the united states 
as domestic sales of products continue to increase  management believes that many american manufacturers will de emphasize the export of their products and will no longer be willing to make the price concessions necessary to be competitive in the international marketplace 
this situation will favor the growth of actrade sa which deals only with foreign made products which are typically less expensive than their american equivalent  and trade financing among these developing countries

discussion of financial condition on a consolidated basis  as of june  the company had total assets of  compared with  at june  and  at june  with total current liabilities of  compared with  and  respectively for june  and 
of the company s assets at june   cash accounted for   represents trade accounts receivable  and  represented tads receivable including  of tads which have been sold to a bank 
the increase in the company s assets at june  was principally due to the increase in cash on hand and an increase in trade acceptance drafts receivable 
there was a decrease of approximately  in trade accounts receivable at june  which resulted from normal variations in collections of receivables by actrade international corp 
and actrade sa and normal variations in company s business and not due to any trend which is expected to have a continuing effect upon operations in the future 
since fiscal  the company has experienced a disproportionate growth rate in its accounts receivable and accounts payable as a percentage of gross revenues due to the nature of the sales made by its air conditioning and refrigeration division and by actrade sa revenues from the air conditioning and refrigeration division are primarily derived from the sale of large commercial and industrial scale units  as opposed to individual home air conditioning units 
consequently  the average invoice amount  as well as the average per item cost  is considerably higher than many of the other products sold by the company resulting in higher cost of goods sold as well as higher accounts receivable and payable 
similarly  the sales revenues generated by actrade sa are from the sale of less expensive foreign made products where the typical gross margins are much lower than for similar american made products 
however  management does not anticipate any additional difficulty in securing any required trade financing  if required  as a result of these transactions since virtually all of these sales are based upon the buyer s confirmed  irrevocable letters of credit 
these factors continued to be true throughout fiscal and are expected to continue for the foreseeable future 
at june   the company s total stockholders equity increased to  as compared to  at june  and  at june  the principal source of funds for the company s operations continues to be revenues earned by its operating subsidiaries 
during the fiscal year ending june   the company projects no significant additional capital expenditures in connection with any of the company s operations except in connection with the continued expansion of sales and marketing operations by capital and the expansion of its international tad program 
however  no estimate can be made at this time of the scope or cost of such expansion plans 
at june  the company also had property  less accumulated depreciation  of  compared to  at june  and  at june  and security deposits and prepaid expenses of  and  respectively 
in connection with the company s relocation during fiscal  it received an month rent abatement from its landlord 
to conform with applicable accounting procedures  the value of this abatement is being amortized over the life of the lease 
at june  the company continued to show  in deferred rent liability 
the company recently announced the allocation of  for the repurchase of its common stock 
this decision was based upon management s belief that recent market prices for the company s shares were below the fair value for such shares 
as of the date of this report the company has repurchased  shares of its common stock at a total cost of approximately  based upon available cash on hand and expected revenues from operations  and accounting for the allocation of cash for its stock repurchase plan  management is of the opinion that it will have adequate available funds to meet its anticipated capital expenditures and cash needs for fiscal thereafter  future capital expenditures will be decided based upon operating results and available revenues from operations 
apart from expenses associated with the implementation of capital s operations and the continued development and expansion of its international tad program  which cannot be estimated at this time  management projects no significant additional capital expenditures in connection with its operations during the next twelve months 
on a consolidated basis  management believes that operations from its subsidiaries will continue to reflect a profit in fiscal and management expects that revenues will be adequate to meet the company s operating cash needs 
the company plans to draw working capital from cash on hand and operating revenues 
the company s outstanding loans payable to its bank in the amount of  represent advances against capital s credit line which is fully secured by the proceeds due from tads which have been sold to the bank but which have not yet been collected 
this loan amount is constantly changing based upon a number of factors including the total amount of tads sold and the extent to which capital needs to utilize this credit facility 
as of the date of this report  the company has a total general credit facility of million and further available credit facilities specifically designated for the sale of tads in the aggregate amount of million with other financial institutions 
these additional facilities will be available to finance the continued purchase of tads from both domestic and foreign customers 
consequently  the payment of these outstanding loans is not expected to have an impact upon the company s liquidity 
iv 
trends affecting liquidity  capital resources and operations over the years  management has observed a substantial increase in demand for american made products 
in management s opinion  this is due to a renewed confidence in the quality of american products and the relative weakness in recent years of the us dollar as compared to other major foreign currencies 
this formed the basis of the company s operating philosophy since and  in management s opinion  continues to favor growth over the foreseeable future 
combined with recent changes in world political structures  management believes the demand for american products will continue to increase at least in the foreseeable future 
over the past decade  economic conditions in the united states have caused many american manufacturers to seek new markets for their products and  in particular  to turn to foreign markets to boost domestic sales 
management believes this trend  coupled with renewed demand for american products and improved buying power of foreign currencies  has been beneficial to the company and has been a major factor in its growth in recent years 
this trend  although expected to continue for the foreseeable future  is now being affected by a number of other factors that could adversely affect future growth rates for the company s present operations 
recently management has observed that  with the collapse of traditional political and ideological barriers  the demand for products from all parts of the world has increased perceptibly with many developing and third world nations now looking for products from many different countries 
this has been particularly true of countries with soft currencies ie currencies not readily exchangeable into established currencies such as british pounds  us dollars  etc  which at present are unable to pay for their purchases in us dollars 
management believes the greatest demand in the next few years for all kinds of foreign products including those from the us and other industrial nations will continue to come from these new developing third world countries 
to meet this changing market demand  the company initiated an expansion of actrade s operations through the establishment of actrade sa  which is intended to compliment current operations by providing foreign sources for products 
as the us economy continued to improve in recent years  and the dollar strengthens with respect to other currencies  foreign buying power for american products has decreased with foreign buyers looking for comparable  but less expensive  products from other sources 
although it is impossible to predict the extent to which this trend may affect the competitiveness of american products overseas  it is likely that any significant decline in buying power of foreign currencies will have an adverse impact upon actrade s present operations 
although no assurances can be given  management believes that by utilizing its foreign network both to promote new sales of american products and as a source of comparable  less expensive foreign made products  the company will gain the flexibility needed to meet changing product demands over the coming years 
a review of the company s statement of operations shows that the cost of goods sold  as a percentage of total sales  has increased from approximately in fiscal to approximately for fiscal which is slightly higher that the experienced in fiscal but still lower than the level reached in fiscal 
this increase is the result of three principal factors 
first  the recessionary factors which influenced economic conditions both in the united states and other major industrial nations worldwide over the past decade resulted in a significant increase in competition for a shrinking market 
this resulted in the need to reduce profit margins in order to remain competitive in the world markets 
second  as discussed above  as the company s operations have expanded the nature and mix of the products sold by the company it has also changed from smaller  less expensive products to larger or more expensive products  such as the commercial and industrial air conditioning and refrigeration equipment that has been a significant proportion of the company s total sales since fiscal with such higher priced products  the profit margins are typically less 
finally  the sales by actrade sa have typically consisted of larger orders primarily for computer systems and related equipment from foreign sources  which typically are based upon lower profit margins 
in combination  these factors resulted in a higher percentage cost of sales for the company 
management believes that for the foreseeable future the greatest demand for all kinds of foreign products including those from industrialized nations including the us will continue to come from the new developing and third world countries 
many factors now have an effect upon the markets for us products overseas including  among others  lower foreign labor costs and  probably most important  the availability of or lack of trade financing 
in management s opinion  the real key to success in international trading has  at least at present  become the ability to provide trade financing in addition to competitive pricing for products 
to meet this changing market demand  during fiscal the company continued the expansion of the international trading operations of actrade sa  which was originally formed to compliment current operations by providing foreign sources for products to meet foreign demand 
due to the financial strength of the company  actrade sa has been in a position to fill the financing void created by the dramatic increase in worldwide demand  thereby allowing it to capture a larger share of the current market demand 
management believes that the introduction of the international tad program will enhance the company s overall position in the world market and enhance both revenues and profits during fiscal the effects of this trend are evident in the company s operating results during the current period 
sales of us products overseas represented by the activities of actrade international corp 
showed only modest gains  reaching  in fiscal as compared to  last year 
sales by actrade sa rose dramatically from  during fiscal to  during fiscal and reaching an all time high of  in fiscal apart from proving management s assumption that as sales of us products decrease  sales of foreign products will increase  these results also point out another important factor  to wit  that worldwide demand for all types of products is increasing 
however  management cannot predict whether the extraordinary rise in sales revenues experienced by actrade sa will continue 
at present  while product demand is high and the availability of trade financing is low  actrade sa enjoys a favorable position in the market 
as these factors stabilize and as trade financing becomes more readily available  it is likely that this advantage will decrease 
beginning in fiscal management experienced relative uncertainty as to the potential effect upon sales for actrade s air conditioning and refrigeration division of the recent change in control of hong kong  where a significant portion of this division s sales originate 
this situation has been further clouded by the recent instability in certain asian economies 
however  based upon discussions had with its major customers in the hong kong market  although no assurances can be given  management does not believe that any materially adverse  long term consequences will result from either the recent changes in hong kong or the economic uncertainties in that region 
in addition  management believes that increased sales activities in both europe and south america will offset any decline in the pacific markets 
management knows of no other trends reasonably expected to have a material impact upon the company s operations or liquidity in the foreseeable future 
vi inflation 
during the past few years inflation in the united states has been relatively stable which  coupled with the relative strength of foreign currencies discussed above  has had a beneficial effect upon the company s operations in that the products it offers have been competitively priced in relation to comparable foreign made products 
in management s opinion  this is expected to continue for the foreseeable future 
however  should the american economy again experience double digit inflation rates  as was the case in the past  the impact upon prices for american goods could adversely affect the company s ability to effectively compete in its overseas markets 
vi 
year compliance 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits  rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have data sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
based upon an assessment made during fiscal  the company has updated all versions of operations and financial software so that all of its systems will utilize dates beyond december  properly 
in addition  the company is currently evaluating all of its auxiliary computer application systems for year compliance  a process which is expected to be completed during the first quarter of fiscal the company believes that the planned modifications and conversions will allow it to mitigate the year issue 
the company also plans to initiate formal communications with all of its significant suppliers  financial institutions and major customers to determine the extent to which the company may be vulnerable to any third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
the financial impact to the company of bringing its equipment and systems into year compliance is not anticipated to be material to its financial position or results of operations
