item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the profitability of the bank depends primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest a and dividend income on interest earning assets  principally loans and investment securities and interest expense on a interest bearing deposits and borrowed funds 
recognizing that sole reliance upon net interest income for earnings is a becoming an increasing matter of concern the bank has formed an asset based lending arm and acquired a trust a company as the first steps towards increasing off balance sheet income 
the bank s net income also is dependent  to a a lesser extent  on the level of its other operating income including service charges and  when available  gains on sales a of securities and operating expenses  such as salaries and employee benefits  net occupancy expense  deposit insurance a premiums  professional fees  goodwill amortization  data processing and miscellaneous other expenses  as well as a federal and state income tax expenses 
business strategy the bank s current business strategy is to continue to serve its market area as a community oriented financial a institution dedicated to financing home ownership and commercial activity and providing financial services to its a customers in an efficient manner 
the principal components of its strategy are discussed below 
emphasizing traditional lending and investment activities 
the bank is a community oriented savings institution a operating primarily in mercer  burlington and ocean counties  new jersey 
the bank s current lending emphasis is a the origination of one to four family residential mortgage loans  multi family and commercial mortgage loans  home a equity and property improvement loans  commercial business loans and consumer loans 
the bank generally originates a loans for its own portfolio and  with limited exceptions  has not engaged in the purchase or sale of loans 
the bank a generally limits its lending activities to mercer and burlington counties  new jersey  and bucks county  a pennsylvania 
however  the bank s asset based lending subsidiary  tsbusiness finance tsbf  provides funds to a corporations located throughout the state of new jersey and the greater delaware valley 
the bank does not engage a in securities trading and limits its investments to us treasury and federal government agency obligations  mortgage backed securities issued by federal government agencies or sponsored corporations  municipal securities and corporate a obligations which are rated a or higher by a national rating agency 
by investing in these types of assets  the bank s a objective has been to supplement its loan portfolio and reduce significantly the credit and interest rate risk of its asset a base in exchange for lower rates of return than would typically be available through lending activities 
in addition  the a bank in january instituted an investment leverage program by borrowing million for reinvestment in federal a agency securities which are designed as available for sale 
complementing the bank s traditional lending by growing the portfolio of higher yielding loans 
to a complement the bank s traditional emphasis on one to four family residential real estate lending  the bank has recently a increased its portfolio of higher yielding loans 
during the twelve months ended december   the bank s portfolio a of commercial business loans increased by million or  to million from million 
this growth a has resulted primarily from the bank s acquisition of burlington county bank bcb  discussed below  and its a establishment of tsbf 
because the yields on these types of loans are generally higher than the yields on one to four a family residential real estate loans  the bank s goal over the next several years is to increase its portfolio of such loans a in a controlled  safe and sound manner 
although management believes that it can safely originate  service and monitor a these loans  such loans generally expose lenders to greater risk of loss than one to four family residential real estate loans 
increasing the bank s fee income 
on september   the bank completed the acquisition of manchester trust bank manchester trust  ocean county  new jersey  a trust services company 
manchester trust was acquired at a purchase price of million 
as of december   manchester trust had million of assets under management 
manchester trust  which is operated as a subsidiary of the bank  provides trust services primarily to retirees in ocean county  new jersey 
management views this acquisition as the first step in a strategic growth into the trust services business  and its goal over the next several years is to increase its total assets under management  and its level of non interest income derived from providing such services  by offering similar services in the other counties in the bank s market area 
strong retail deposit base 
the bank has full service offices located in mercer and burlington county and two full service offices located in limited access retirement communities located in ocean county  new jersey 
the bank believes it has a stable community real estate deposit base 
the bank believes its market share of deposits is approximately in mercer county  new jersey and in burlington county  new jersey 
the bank has recently introduced several new products and services as part of a strategy of increasing its transaction accounts and decreasing its reliance on certificates of deposit 
as of december  transaction and savings accounts totaled million  or of the bank s total deposit 
the bank does not solicit for deposits outside its primary market area and does not utilize the services of deposit brokers 
growth through acquisitions 
a component of the bank s operating strategy has recently been and continues to be growth through acquisitions 
the bank believes that assets and expertise acquired in whole bank acquisitions can supplement the bank s internal growth in areas that have not traditionally been emphasized by the bank 
accordingly  the bank s growth in its portfolio of higher yielding loans was supplemented by its acquisition on october  of bcb  an million commercial bank located in burlington township  new jersey  at a purchase price of million  and the bank s development of its trust services business was the result of its acquisition of manchester trust with million of assets under management  and bcb with approximately million of assets under management at the time of acquisition 
management s strategy is to continue to grow these lines of business  as well as the bank s deposits and portfolio of other loans  through additional acquisitions and internal development 
the company s ability to grow through selective acquisitions of other financial institutions or branches of such institutions will depend on successfully identifying  acquiring and integrating such institutions or branches into the bank 
there can be no assurance the company will be able to generate internal growth or to identify attractive acquisition candidates  acquire such candidates on favorable terms or successfully integrate any acquired institutions or branches into the bank 
the bank has no specific agreements or understandings regarding any additional expansions or acquisitions at this time 
in addition  the bank intends to grow internally through de novo branching  and has received ots approval to open a branch office in bucks county  pennsylvania 
market risk and asset and liability management general 
the bank s most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk  as the majority of the bank s assets and liabilities are sensitive to interest rate changes 
it is the objective of the bank to minimize  to the degree prudently possible  its exposure to interest rate risk  while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread 
interest rate spread is the difference between the bank s yield on its interest earning assets and its cost of interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate risk is generally understood to be the sensitivity of the bank s earnings  net asset values  and stockholders equity to changes in market interest rates 
changes in interest rates affect the bank s earnings 
the effect on earnings of changes in interest rates generally depends on how quickly the bank s yield on interest earning assets and cost of interest bearing liabilities react to the changes in market rates of interest 
if the bank s cost of deposit accounts reacts more quickly to changes in market interest rates than the yield on the bank s mortgage loans and other interest earnings assets  then an increasing interest rate environment is likely to adversely affect the bank s earnings and a decreasing interest rate environment is likely to favorably affect the bank s earnings 
on the other hand  if the bank s yield on its mortgage loans and other interest earnings assets reacts more quickly to changes in market interest rates than the bank s cost of deposit accounts  then an increasing interest rate environment is likely to favorably affect the bank s earnings and a decreasing interest rate environment is likely to adversely affect the bank s earnings 
interest rate sensitivity is managed by the asset liability management committee alco 
the principal objective of alco is to maximize income within acceptable levels of established risk policy 
the table set forth below shows that the bank s interest bearing liabilities which mature or reprice within short periods exceed its interest earning assets with similar characteristics 
accordingly  a material and prolonged increasing interest rate environment generally would adversely affect net interest income  while a material and prolonged decreasing interest rate environment generally would have a positive effect on net interest income 
the bank s current investment strategy is to maintain an overall securities portfolio that provides a source of liquidity and that contributes to the bank s overall profitability and asset mix within given quality and maturity considerations 
the securities portfolio is concentrated in us treasury and federal government agency securities providing high asset quality to the overall balance sheet mix 
most securities recently purchased by the bank have been classified as available for sale to provide management with the flexibility to make adjustments to the portfolio given changes in the economic or interest rate environment  to fulfill unanticipated liquidity needs  or to take advantage of alternative investment opportunities 
the following table presents the difference between the bank s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  expected to reprice or mature  based on certain assumptions  in each of the future time periods shown 
this table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the bank s net interest income because the repricing of certain assets and liabilities is subject to competitive and other limitations 
as a result  certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing within a stated period may in fact mature or reprice at different times and at different volumes

in preparing the table above  it has been assumed  in assessing the interest rate sensitivity of the bank  that i mortgage loans will prepay at a rate of per year  ii fixed maturity deposits will not be withdrawn prior to maturity  and iii demand and savings accounts will decay at the following rates over over year through through over or less years years years demand accounts savings accounts certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the preceding table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
in addition  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on short term basis and over the life of the assets 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to make payments on their adjustable rate debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase net portfolio value 
the ots has adopted a final rule that incorporates an interest rate risk irr component into the risk based capital rules 
the irr component is a dollar amount that will be deducted from total capital for the purpose of calculating an institution s risk based capital requirement and is expressed in terms of the sensitivity of its net portfolio value npv to changes in interest rates 
npv is the difference between discounted incoming and outgoing cash flows from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts 
an institution s irr is measured as the change to its npv as a result of a hypothetical basis point change in market interest rates 
a resulting change in npv of more than of the estimated market value of its assets will require the institution to deduct from its capital of that excess change 
the rule provides that the ots will calculate the irr component quarterly for each institution from the institution s thrift financial reports 
the ots has postponed the date that the component will first be deducted from an institution s total capital to provide it with an opportunity to review the interest rate risk approaches taken by the other federal banking agencies 
the following table presents the bank s npv as of december   as calculated by the ots  based on information provided to the ots to the bank 
change in change in npv interest rates as a percentage of in basis points net portfolio value estimated market rate shock amount change change value of assets dollars in thousands static  as shown by the table above  increases in interest rates will result in net decreases in the bank s npv  while decreases in interest rates will result in smaller net increases in the bank s npv 
the table suggests that in the event of a basis point change in interest rates  the bank would experience a decrease in npv in a rising interest rate environment  and a increase in npv in a decreasing interest rate environment 
comparison of financial condition stockholders equity increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase in stockholders equity was due to net income of million for the year ended december  which more than offset by a net after tax decrease of  in the market value of the bank s portfolio of available for sale investments and dividends paid of million 
the decrease was primarily attributed to the bank s sale of equity securities to comply with ots regulations that require the bank to divest its portfolio of equity securities 
the bank completed the divestiture in the third quarter of at december  the bancorp s tangible  core and risk based capital ratios were   and  respectively 
total assets increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  deposits increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  cash and cash equivalents decreased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  securities available for sale increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  on january   the bank instituted an investment leverage program by borrowing million for reinvestment in federal agency securities which were designated as available for sale

the bank s investment in federal home loan bank fhlb stock increased  or  to million at december  from million at december   as the bank s larger mortgage loan portfolio required additional investment in fhlb stock 
average balance sheet the following table sets forth certain information relating to the bank s average balance sheet and reflects the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the periods indicated and the average yields earned and rates paid 
such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the years presented 
average balances are derived from daily average balances

the following table presents for the periods indicated the total dollar amount of interest from average interest earning assets and the resultant yields  as well as the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  expressed both in dollar and rates  and the net interest margin 
dividends received are included as interest income 
the table does not reflect any effect of income taxes 
all average balances are based on month end balances 
management believes that using month end balances  as opposed to daily balances  has not caused any material differences in the information presented
