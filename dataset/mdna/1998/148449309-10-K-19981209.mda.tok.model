item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations s omitted except share amounts results of operations general from august to september   one or more of the company s subsidiaries conducted refining operations 
by december   the company s refining subsidiaries had sold all of their refining assets 
in addition  powerine  one of the company s refining subsidiaries  merged into a subsidiary of emc and was no longer a subsidiary of the company 
the company s other refining subsidiaries own no refining assets and are in the process of liquidation 
as a result  the company has accounted for its refining operations as discontinued operations in the company s financial statements as of september  and retroactively 
accordingly  discussion of results of operations has been confined to the results of continuing operations and the anticipated impact  if any  of liquidation of the remaining inactive refining subsidiaries and contingent environmental liabilities of the company or its refining subsidiaries  if any 
as noted above  the company sold its rusk county  texas oil and gas properties and pipeline to uprc and upipc  respectively  in may the oil and gas reserves sold approximated of the company s proved oil and gas reserves at the date of sale 
as a result operations applicable to the assets sold impacted consolidated operations for twelve months in fiscal  eight months in fiscal and no months in fiscal fiscal vs fiscal natural gas marketing and transmission gas sales from natural gas marketing increased  or from fiscal to gas sales in each fiscal year consist of the following september  gas sales to lone star   gas sales to mgng   gas sales to third parties lone star contract natural gas sales under the lone star contract increased  or from fiscal to fiscal under the company s long term gas sales contract with lone star  the price received for gas is essentially fixed through may  the variance in gas sales  therefore  is almost entirely attributable to the volumes of gas delivered 
although the volumes sold to lone star annually are essentially fixed the lone star contract has a take or pay provision  the lone star contract year is from february to january whereas the company s fiscal year is from october to september furthermore  although the volumes to be taken by lone star in a given contract year are fixed  there is no provision requiring equal monthly or daily volumes and deliveries accordingly vary with lone star s seasonal and peak demands 
such variances have been significant 
as a result  lone star deliveries  although fixed for a contract year  may be skewed and not proportional for the company s fiscal periods 
for fiscal  sales to lone star were approximately more than those which would have resulted if daily deliveries had been fixed and equal 
at september   the remaining volumes to be delivered under the lone star contract were approximately greater than those that would be delivered if daily deliveries were fixed and equal 
as a result  future revenues from the lone star contract are expected to be higher than those that would result if remaining lone star deliveries were fixed and equal 
gas sales to mgng remained the same in fiscal as in fiscal because the gas sales contract with mgng requires a fixed daily volume of gas at a fixed price and the mgng contract was in force for all of the periods being compared 
gas purchases increased  or from fiscal to fiscal gas purchases in each of the fiscal years consist of the following september gas purchases lone star contract   gas purchases mgng contract   gas purchases sales to third parties gas purchases for the lone star contract increased  or from fiscal to fiscal for fiscal gas purchases comprised of gas sales versus of gas sales for fiscal from to the gross margin increased  or 
during the same periods the gross margin percentage gas sales gas purchases as a percentage of gas sales increased from for fiscal to for fiscal the decrease in gas purchases as a percentage of gas sales and the concomitant increase in gross margin percentage for the lone star contract resulted primarily from non recurring favorable adjustments of gas purchase costs in fiscal and the replacement of high price gas contracts expiring in april with lower market price contracts 
gas purchases for the contract with mgng increased or from fiscal to fiscal the gas sales volumes sold to mgng for each of the two years being compared were equal  hence the increase is entirely attributable to increased market prices for gas  net of hedging effects 
gas purchased for third parties increased from zero in fiscal to in fiscal the gas sales to third parties in fiscal resulted because lone star limited its daily gas purchases to of volumes nominated and the company had to sell the excess gas elsewhere 
the restriction of daily sales to of volumes nominated did not  however  affect annual volumes that lone star was required to take under the lone star contract 
in august  the company hedged all of its remaining unhedged gas requirements 
as a result of such hedging  the company has fixed its price exposure on its gas sales contract with mgng through may   the termination date for the contract 
operating costs operating costs decreased to a recovery of for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  because the texas pipeline was sold to uprc in may and as of june  the company no longer incurred operating costs to operate the texas pipeline 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased from for the year ended september  to for the year ended september  most general and administrative expenses incurred during the year ended september  related to the texas pipeline  which was sold in may the remaining administrative expenses consist primarily of consulting fees for on going gas marketing operations 
transportation transportation expense increased  from for the year ended september  to  for the year ended september  during the period october  to may   one of the company s subsidiaries owned and operated the texas pipeline and all transportation revenues were for intercompany transportation and were accordingly eliminated in consolidation of the company s financial statements 
on may   the company sold the texas pipeline to upipc 
in both and  transportation expense consisted entirely of the amortization of a  prepaid transportation asset 
amortization is based upon and thus proportional to deliveries made to lone star 
in fiscal  four months transportation expense was recorded versus twelve months transportation expense in fiscal depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization decreased  or from fiscal fiscal the decrease is attributable to the sale of the texas pipeline to uprc in may as a result of the sale  the company no longer owned or depreciated the texas pipeline 
exploration and production as noted above  the company sold its texas oil and gas properties to uprc in may the reserves sold represented approximately of the company s proved oil and gas reserves and of the company s oil and gas production at the time of sale 
comparison of fiscal oil and gas sales  production expenses  general and administrative expenses and depletion  depreciation and amortization to those in fiscal is thus not meaningful 
accordingly  exploration and production operations comparisons and analysis have been limited to operations from those oil and gas properties which were not sold to uprc 
the related operating results for such properties are as follows year ended september  revenues oil and gas sales   well operations expenses oil and gas production general and administrative depreciation  depletion and amortization operating income  revenues oil and gas sales oil and gas sales decreased or from fiscal to fiscal the decrease is attributable to decreased oil and gas prices and decreased production 
many of the company s oil and gas reserves are mature reserves and such decreased production is expected 
although the company has participated in drilling twenty three new wells and several reworks on existing wells from july through september   production from such new drilling activities has only recently begun impacting operations 
the company is currently participating in two drilling programs and expects to participate in at least ten additional new wells in fiscal the company is also reviewing possible investments in other oil and gas drilling programs and oil and gas property acquisitions  including several requiring substantial investment 
as a result  the company expects that  if it is successful in making acquisitions  its oil and gas sales will eventually increase given stable oil and gas sales prices 
however  there can be no assurance that wells expected to be drilled will actually be drilled  that such drilling will be successful or that the company will be successful in making acquisitions or that oil and gas sales will increase 
well operations revenue from well operations decreased or from fiscal to fiscal the decrease is attributable to the company s resignation as operator on certain appalachian wells in fiscal where a non operator offered to operate the wells at a cost significantly less than that being incurred by the company in performing such operations 
the related well operations revenues were not replaced 
expenses oil and gas production oil and gas production expenses increased or from fiscal to fiscal the increase in oil and gas production expenses results from the general maturing of the company s oil and gas properties and the tendency for older  depleting properties to carry a higher production expense burden than recently drilled properties 
furthermore  oil and gas production expenses  especially non capitalized repairs  do not generally occur evenly each year and are best compared on a cumulative rather than on an annual basis 
the company expects that  although oil and gas production expense will increase as a result of its new drilling activities  such expenses will decline as a percentage of oil and gas sales given the lower production costs typically associated with new production 
there can be no assurance  however  that such will be the case 
general and administrative general and administrative costs increased or from fiscal to the fiscal the net increase was primarily attributable to higher employee costs and bonuses  higher consulting fees and increased legal costs 
the increase was offset to a minor extent by tax refunds and vendor settlements in fiscal for which there was no counterpart in fiscal depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased or from fiscal to the fiscal the decrease is attributable to slightly decreased production and significantly lower depletion rate per unit of production 
the lower depletion rate results primarily from the company s sale of of its proved oil and gas reserves to uprc 
other income expense gain on sale of assets in may  the company s subsidiaries sold their texas oil and gas assets and pipeline to uprc  resulting in a  gain 
there was no counterpart in fiscal interest income interest income increased or from fiscal to fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in the average balance of invested unrestricted cash 
for the year ended september   of interest income was attributable to a note receivable from mg related to the powerine arbitration and resulted from the investment of excess cash 
for the year ended september   was attributable to interest on the mg note  was attributable to interest on a note from penn octane corporation penn octane  a public company involved in liquid petroleum and compressed natural gas business  and the remaining  was attributable to the investment of excess cash 
interest on the mg note ceased on october  interest expense interest expense decreased  from  for the year ended september  to for the year ended september  because the company repaid all of its long term debt in may with a portion of the proceeds from the sale of its texas oil and gas properties and pipeline to uprc 
penn octane note in october  the company invested  in a promissary note of penn octane 
the note bears interest at payable quarterly and was due on june  at june   penn octane did not repay the note 
in may of  penn octane was awarded a judgement against a bank and such judgement is in excess of the  owed to the company by penn octane 
in december  penn octane assigned its interest in the bank judgement to the extent of the company s note to the company in return for an extension of the note until june  the company also received  warrants to purchase the common stock of penn octane for one dollar and seventy five cents per share as consideration for the extension 
the bank owing the judgement has appealed it and such appeal may not be resolved for a year or more 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the judgement will be upheld upon appeal or that the bank will ultimately pay the judgement won by penn octane to the company 
if the note is not repaid by its extended due date  the company intends to reduce the penn octane note to its estimated realizable value  if any 
on february   the company entered into an agreement with alexander allen  inc aa concerning amounts owed to the company by aa and its subsidiary  gamxx energy  inc gamxx 
the company had made loans to gamxx through in the aggregate amount of approximately  when gamxx was unable to obtain financing  the company recorded a one hundred percent loss provision on its loans to gamxx while still retaining its lender s lien against gamxx 
pursuant to the terms of the gamxx agreement  the company is to receive  cash in settlement for its loans when gamxx closes on its financing 
gamxx expected such closing not later than may  but such closing has not yet occurred 
the company has carried its loans to gamxx at zero the last six years 
the company will record the  proceeds as other income if and when it collects such amount 
there can be no assurance that gamxx will close on its financing 
tax provision as a result of the tax benefit recorded in fiscal  the company expected to provide for income taxes at a blended statutory rate for the remainder of the lone star contract for book purposes 
during this period the company expected to pay income taxes  however  at a effective rate  consisting of federal alternative minimum tax 
the company s tax provision for fiscal consists of two components a 
the tax provision on pre tax accounting income  exclusive of the  gain on the sale of assets  aggregates  and essentially represents the partial utilization of the  deferred tax asset recorded at september  at an effective rate of of earnings 
if future events change the company s estimate concerning the probability of utilizing its tax assets  appropriate adjustments will be made when such a conclusion is reached 
b 
the tax provision on the  gain equals the company s expected tax liability for the income related to the sale and aggregates the tax rate used in such calculation was  the federal alternative minimum tax rate 
the company is not yet subject to a higher tax rate due to its tax carryforwards 
a tax provision of was not provided for the gain because a related deferred tax asset was not previously provided since the company did not anticipate selling the properties and had previously taken the properties off the market 
the tax provision for the year ended september  consists primarily of a tax provision of  utilization of deferred tax asset and an offsetting reversal of tax estimates and contingencies of  the company evaluated its need for a deferred tax valuation allowance at september  based upon recent positive evidence confirming the company s ability to utilize its tax carryforwards 
the company expects that its future tax expense for fiscal for book purposes is expected to be although the company only expects to pay taxes at a rate 
the rate results from federal alternative minimum taxes 
earnings per share since november  the company has reacquired  shares of its common stock representing approximately of shares outstanding 
as a result of these share acquisitions  earnings per outstanding share have increased significantly 
fiscal vs fiscal natural gas marketing and transmission gas sales from natural gas marketing and transmission increased  or from fiscal to the increase consists of the following september  gas sales to lone star   gas sales to mgng   lone star contact natural gas sales under the lone star contract increased  or from fiscal to fiscal under the company s long term gas sales contract with lone star  the price received for gas is essentially fixed through may  the variance in gas sales  therefore  is almost entirely attributable to the volumes of gas delivered 
although the volumes sold to lone star annually are essentially fixed the lone star contract has a take or pay provision  the lone star contract year is from february to january whereas the company s fiscal year is from october to september furthermore  although the volumes to be taken by lone star in a given contract year are fixed  there is no provision requiring fixed monthly or daily volumes and deliveries accordingly vary with lone star s seasonal and peak demands 
such variances have been significant 
as a result  lone star deliveries  although fixed for a contract year  may be skewed and not proportional for the company s fiscal periods 
for fiscal  deliveries and sales to lone star  including those derived from the company s own production  were approximately less than those which would have resulted if daily deliveries had been fixed and equal 
at september   the remaining volumes to be delivered under the lone star contract were approximately greater than those that would be delivered to lone star if daily deliveries were fixed and equal 
gas sales to mgng increased  or from fiscal to fiscal because such sales commenced june  since sales to mgng are for equal daily volumes at fixed prices the increase in gas sales is directly proportional to the increase in the sales period 
gas purchases increased  or from fiscal to fiscal the increase consists of the following september  gas purchases lone star contract   gas purchases mgng contract   gas purchases for the lone star contract increased  or from fiscal to fiscal for fiscal gas purchases comprised of gas sales versus of gas sales for fiscal from to the gross margin increased or 
during the same periods the gross margin percentage gas sales gas purchases as a percentage of gas sales decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal the increase in gas purchases as a percentage of gas sales and the concomitant decrease in the gross margin percentage result from offsetting factors 
the cost of gas decreased because the company replaced gas contracts that expired in april with market price contracts 
the expiring contracts called for gas prices substantially in excess of market prices whereas the replacement gas contracts are at market prices  resulting in the decreased costs to the company for a portion of the gas it supplies to lone star 
this reduction was offset by the higher gas prices that the company had to pay for the of its gas that it supplies to lone star and that is not hedged and to a minor degree by a non recurring favorable gas purchase adjustment in the first quarter of fiscal which had no counterpart in fiscal gas purchases applicable to the mgng contract as a percentage of related sales increased from in fiscal to in fiscal in fiscal the gross margin was versus a deficit of in fiscal the increase in the cost of gas purchases and related decrease in the gross margin were caused by increases in spot gas prices  net of hedging adjustments 
operating costs decreased or from fiscal to fiscal most of the decrease is attributable to the sale of the castle pipeline to upipc on may  other factors accounting for the decrease include the termination of two pipeline employees in january  when the company still operated the castle pipeline and decreased insurance costs  property taxes and compressor maintenance costs during the first eight months of fiscal versus the first eight months of fiscal general and administrative costs decreased or from fiscal to fiscal the primary factor causing the decrease was the sale of the castle pipeline to upipc on may   resulting in only minor general and administrative expense thereafter 
other factors causing the decrease were the termination of management agreements with subsidiaries of mg in january and the performance of their functions internally without additional costs and decreased insurance cost 
these were offset by an increase due to a severance payment to the former president of the company s natural gas marketing subsidiary in january although the company still markets natural gas  it no longer owns or operates its texas pipeline 
future natural gas marketing general and administrative expenses are expected to be immaterial 
transportation transportation expense increased from zero for fiscal to for fiscal all of the transportation expense for fiscal was incurred from june  to september  and results from the amortization of the prepaid transportation asset received from upipc in the sale of the castle pipeline see note to the financial statements 
prior to the sale to upipc  the company owned and operated the castle pipeline and intercompany transportation charges were eliminated in consolidation 
commencing june   the company commenced amortizing the  prepaid transportation asset over the remaining term of the lone star contract  which expires on may  depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization decreased or from fiscal to fiscal the decrease results from the sale of the castle pipeline to upipc on may  the decrease approximates the amount of depreciation and depletion that would have been incurred had the castle pipeline not been sold 
exploration and production oil and gas sales decreased  or from fiscal to fiscal the decrease results primarily from the sale of of the company s proved reserves to uprc on may  see note to the financial statements 
in fiscal oil and gas sales applicable to such reserves were for twelve months versus only eight months in fiscal in addition to the sale of the properties to uprc  two other offsetting factors are relevant 
oil and gas sales decreased due to a decrease in production volumes 
the decline in production volumes results from the general maturing of the company s reserves since the company has not made any significant reserve acquisitions and did not conduct any significant drilling until july this decrease was offset by an increase in oil and gas prices in fiscal as a result of the sale to uprc  the company s oil and gas production is expected to decrease by at least 
nevertheless  the company has recently entered into a joint venture with another operator to drill up to appalachian wells over the next three to four years and is also in the process of drilling approximately coalbed methane wells in alabama 
in addition  the company is currently reviewing several possible acquisitions of oil and gas assets 
as a result the company expects to replace some of the production and reserves that it sold to uprc 
revenues from well operations decreased or from fiscal to fiscal the decrease results primarily from operating revenues lost when the company sold its rusk county  texas oil and gas properties to uprc in may oil and gas production expenses decreased or from fiscal to fiscal the decrease was caused by the sale of the company s rusk county oil and gas properties to uprc on may  in fiscal oil and gas production expenses were of oil and gas sales versus of oil and gas sales in fiscal the increase in production expenses as a percentage of oil and gas sales results from the general maturing of the company s oil and gas properties  the lack of new drilling by the company for most of the recent fiscal year and the tendency for older depleting properties to carry a higher production expense burden than recently drilled properties 
as noted above  the company has commenced several drilling activities and the oil and gas production expense ratio may improve in the future  although there can be no assurance such will be the case 
general and administrative expenses decreased or from fiscal to fiscal the decrease results from offsetting factors 
general and administrative expenses decreased because the company closed its tulsa office in june and because the company sold its rusk county  texas oil and gas properties to uprc in may these decreases were offset  however  by increased legal fees due to the larry long litigation which was filed in july see note to the financial statements 
depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased or from fiscal to fiscal the decrease was primarily caused by the sale of the company s rusk county  texas oil and gas properties to uprc on may  had the properties not been sold to uprc  depreciation  depletion and amortization for fiscal would have been approximately higher 
on may   the company sold its texas oil and gas properties and pipeline see note to the financial statements 
the sale resulted in a  non recurring gain 
there was no counterpart in fiscal interest income increased or primarily because of interest earned from june  to september  on the unspent proceeds from the sale of the company s texas oil and gas properties and pipeline see note to the financial statements 
other income expense decreased  from  of other income for fiscal to other expenses of for fiscal of the  of other income in   represented recoveries from a plaintiff class escrow fund related to stockholder litigation 
the parties reached a settlement with respect to the stockholder litigation in october the proceeds to the company represent unclaimed funds that were to revert to the company pursuant to the settlement order for the litigation 
interest expense decreased or from fiscal to fiscal the net decrease in interest expense is attributable to offsetting factors 
amortization of debt issuance costs  which is treated as interest expense under generally accepted accounting principles  increased from for fiscal to for fiscal the increase is attributable to debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the company s refinancing of its senior debt 
interest expense  on the other hand  decreased  from  for fiscal to for fiscal primarily because the average debt outstanding during fiscal was less than that outstanding during fiscal on may   the company repaid its debt 
the company does not anticipate that it will need debt financing in the foreseeable future 
tax provision as a result of the tax benefit recorded in fiscal  the company expected to provide for income taxes at a blended statutory rate for the remainder of the lone star contract for book purposes 
during this period the company expected to pay income taxes  however  at a effective rate  consisting of federal alternative minimum tax 
the company s tax provision for fiscal consists of two components a 
the tax provision on pre tax accounting income  exclusive of the  gain on the sale of assets  aggregates  and essentially represents the amortization of the  deferred tax asset recorded at september  at an effective rate of of earnings 
if future events change the company s estimate concerning the probability of utilizing its tax assets  appropriate adjustments will be made when such a conclusion is reached 
b 
the tax provision on the  gain equals the company s expected tax liability for the income related to the sale and aggregates the tax rate used in such calculation was  the federal alternative minimum tax rate 
the company is not subject to a higher tax rate due to its carryforwards 
a tax provision of was not provided for the gain because a related deferred tax asset was not previously provided since the company did not anticipate selling the properties and had previously taken the properties off the market

although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove correct 
factors that could cause the company s results to differ materially from the results discussed in such forward looking statements are disclosed in this report  including without limitation in conjunction with the expected cash receipts and expected cash obligations included below 
all forward looking statements in this form k are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements in this paragraph 
furthermore  this statement constitutes a year readiness disclosure statement and the statements contained herein are subject to the year information and readiness disclosure act act 
in case of a dispute  this document and information contained herein are entitled to protection of the act 
during the year ended september   the company generated  from operating activities 
of this amount   represented the collection of a portion of the mg note 
during the same period the company invested  in a note from penn octane   in oil and gas properties and  to reacquire shares of its common stock 
in addition  it paid  in stockholder dividends 
at september   the company had  of unrestricted cash   of working capital and no long term debt 
discontinued refining operations although the company s subsidiaries have exited the refining business and third parties have assumed environmental liabilities  if any  of such subsidiaries  the company and several of its subsidiaries remain liable for contingent environmental liabilities see item and note to the financial statements 
at the present time the probable future cash expenditures of the company consist of the following a 
investments in oil and gas properties and energy sector in fiscal  the company drilled new coalbed methane wells in alabama and participated in drilling twelve new wells in pennsylvania as part of a joint venture to drill up to wells in appalachia over the next three to four years 
at least ten new appalachian wells are planned by the joint venture over the next year and the company may drill additional coalbed methane wells in alabama 
in addition  the company is also reviewing several possible joint ventures  reserve acquisitions and drilling ventures  including several overseas  as well as other investments in the energy sector 
the company believes that low oil and gas prices will increase the probability that the company can conclude a transaction or several transactions on terms favorable to the company 
there can be no assurance  however  that oil and gas prices will decrease or remain low or that a transaction will be closed even if such prices decrease or remain low 
selling companies may decide not to sell or delay selling in the hope of higher oil and gas prices 
several competitors have significantly more resources than the company and may outbid it in future acquisitions 
b 
repurchase of company shares as of november   the company had repurchased  of its shares of common stock at a cost of  the company s board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to  shares to provide an exit vehicle for investors who want to liquidate their investment in the company 
as a result   shares can be repurchased under the current authorization of the board of directors 
the decision whether to repurchase additional shares will depend upon the market price of the company s stock  tax considerations  the number of stockholders seeking to sell their shares and other factors 
c 
recurring dividends the company s board of directors adopted a policy of paying a 
per share annual dividend 
per share quarterly in june of the company expects to continue to pay such dividend until the board of directors  in its sole discretion  changes such policy 
an estimate of the company s expected cash resources and obligations from october  to september   the fiscal year end during which the lone star contract expires  is as follows expected cash resources s omitted unrestricted cash on hand september   cash flow gas marketing and exploration and production operations  repayment of penn octane corporation note  proceeds from swap litigation irlp proceeds from american western note  interest  proceeds from mgng contract litigation expected cash obligations new drilling  quarterly dividends based on outstanding shares at november assumed irlp payment of vendors and funding of environmental reserves  legal defense costs environmental litigation excess of expected cash resources over expected cash obligations  the following apply to the company s expected cash resources and obligations a 
interest income on cash has been computed at 
if unanticipated expenditures are made or interest rates decrease  interest income will decrease 
b 
the company is currently evaluating several investments in the energy sector but has not yet made any additional expenditures or commitments 
it may  nevertheless  do so in the future 
the above cash estimates do not include any expenditures for such investments 
c 
the company s board of directors has authorized the purchase by the company of up to  shares of common stock in the open market 
to date   shares have been repurchased 
the company may or may not repurchase the remaining  shares available and the board of directors may or may not increase the current authorization  depending on market prices and other factors 
no additional repurchases are assumed in the above estimates 
d 
although the company s board of directors has adopted a quarterly dividend policy of 
per share  the board may elect to change such policy at any time 
e 
the company has assumed certain cash flow returns from its recently completed and planned drilling activities 
there can be no assurance that such drilling activities will be successful or that the projected returns will be achieved 
f 
the company is pursuing a line of credit from a financial institution in case it decides to make an investment or acquisition requiring more cash than the company currently has 
in addition to the foregoing  the above estimates assume that the company will not be adversely impacted by any of the following risk factors 
if such events occur  the company s estimated cash flow will probably be adversely affected and such effects may be material 
contingent environmental liabilities although the company has never itself conducted refining operations and its refining subsidiaries have exited the refining business and the company does not anticipate any required expenditures related to discontinued refining operations  interested parties could seek redress from the company for environmental liabilities 
in the past  government and other plaintiffs have often named the most financially capable parties in such cases regardless of the existence or extent of actual liability 
as a result there exists the possibility that the company could be named for any environmental claims related to discontinued refining operations of its present and former refining subsidiaries 
the company was informed that the epa has investigated offsite acid sludge waste found near the indian refinery and was also remediating surface contamination in the indian refinery property 
neither the company nor irlp has been named with respect to these two actions 
in october  the epa named the company and two of its subsidiaries as potentially responsible parties for the expected clean up of the indian refinery 
in addition  eighteen other parties were named including texaco refining and marketing  inc  the refinery operator for over years 
the company subsequently responded to the epa indicating that it was neither the owner nor operator of the indian refinery and thus not responsible for its remediation 
estimated undiscounted clean up costs for the indian refinery are  to  according to third parties 
although the company does not believe it has any liabilities with respect to the environmental liabilities of the refineries  a court of competent jurisdiction may find otherwise 
a recent decision by the us supreme court has supported the company s position 
the above statement of expected cash resources and obligations assume a expenditure for legal defense costs related to the indian refinery 
if related legal proceedings continue longer than expected environmental litigation often continues years or more or the company is found liable for a portion of the environmental remediation of either the indian refinery or powerine refinery  estimated cash flow would be decreased and the decrease would be significant 
irlp vendor liabilities irlp owes its vendors approximately  its only major asset is a  note due from the purchaser of the indian refinery  american western 
in november  american western filed for bankruptcy and has since sold the indian refinery to an outside party 
management estimates that irlp may recover  which will be available for creditors of irlp and environmental reserves 
although irlp holds a first mortgage on the indian refinery  other creditors of american western may attempt to circumvent irlp s first mortgage 
it is  therefore  unlikely that irlp s share of the proceeds will be sufficient to settle its vendor liabilities 
if irlp cannot settle its vendor liabilities  irlp may file for bankruptcy since its only significant asset is its note due from american western 
in addition  in fiscal the illinois department of revenue filed to assess two present officers of the company and two former officers of the company for certain tax liabilities of irlp 
the company has responded that its officers are not liable for the taxes 
although the company does not believe such developments will affect its estimated cash flow  such may not be the case 
irlp s vendors may attempt to hold the company liable for irlp s debts and or the illinois department of revenue may prevail in its efforts to assess officers of the company for irlp liabilities  in which case the company would have indemnification obligations to such officers 
in either case the company s estimated cash flow would be adversely affected 
larry long litigation the above cash flow assumes the company will not have to pay any claim related to the larry long litigation 
although the sale of the company s texas oil and gas properties and pipeline to uprc have significantly reduced the company s exposure  there can be no assurance that the plaintiffs will not file new lawsuits  having already amended their original complaint three times 
in such case  the company would be exposed to the continuing legal costs of defending the amended petitions  and  if it is determined that settlement is in the company s best interest  the cost to settle the lawsuit 
no such costs are included in the above estimate of cash flow 
credit risk lone star at the current time  in excess of of the company s gas marketing sales are to a single customer  lone star  under a long term gas sale contract  which terminates on may  although lone star has paid for all gas purchased  any inability of lone star to continue to pay for gas purchased would adversely affect the company s cash flow 
supply risk mgng the company now purchases virtually all of its gas supplies for the lone star contract from mgng at fixed prices 
if spot gas prices increase significantly and mgng has not hedged its future commitment to supply gas to the company or if mgng experiences financial problems  mgng may be unable to meet its gas supply commitments to the company 
if mgng does not fulfill its gas supply commitment to the company  the company may not be able to fulfill its gas delivery commitment to lone star through may   the termination of the lone star contract  or to earn the gross margins currently being earned 
this would adversely impact the company s cash flow 
under such circumstances the company may not be able to recover lost profits and cash flow from mgng despite contractual provisions providing for such recovery 
gas contract litigation the company s natural gas marketing subsidiaries and mgng are parties to several natural gas contracts 
one subsidiary has sued mgng to recover gas measurement and transportation costs in excess of see item to this k 
although the company believes it is entitled to in excess of plus interest and has included such recovery in its estimated cash flow  it is possible that a court of competent jurisdiction may find otherwise 
it is also possible that the company and mg may litigate other issues related to the gas supply contract with mgng 
to the extent the company does not recover at least from present or future gas contract litigation with mgng  the company s projected cash flow will be decreased 
public market for the company s stock although there presently exists a market for the company s stock  such market is volatile and the company s stock is thinly traded 
such volatility may adversely affect the market price and liquidity of the company s common stock 
in addition  the company  through its stock repurchase program  has effectively become the major market maker in the company s stock 
if the company ceases repurchasing shares the market value of the company s stock may be adversely affected 
future of the company as noted in item i and note to the financial statements item of this form k  the company recently sold of its proved oil and gas reserves and its texas pipeline 
the company s primary remaining asset is its gas sales contract with lone star  which expires on may  although the company is reviewing and seeking investments in the energy sector  including oil and gas property acquisitions and drilling ventures  the company has not yet been able to acquire such investments at a favorable price 
there are also many competitors with resources greater than those of the company 
if the company does not acquire additional assets  its board of directors may decide to pursue other courses of action  including but not limited to liquidation  sale of assets  merger or other reorganization 
year the company has recently completed a study of the year issue and related risks 
as a result of the study  the company has replaced its oil and gas and general ledger software with new software which is year compliant 
the company expects the cost to approximate at september   had been incurred 
the company commenced using the new software in the first quarter of fiscal the company has also made inquiries to outside parties who process transactions of the company  eg  payroll  commercial banks  transfer agent  reserve engineers  etc 
while some outside parties have confirmed they are year compliant  others have not done so to the company s satisfaction 
the company is continuing to pursue the vendors whose responses appear to provide insufficient assurance 
the most important systems operated by the company are its revenue distributions  joint interest billing and general ledger 
the company replaced its software because the new systems are year compliant 
if a year problem nevertheless occurred  the company could process transactions for several months manually or using small computers but only with increased administrative costs 
nevertheless  in many cases  the company is not the operator of a given well or purchaser of oil and gas production 
in those cases the company is dependent upon the operator and or gas oil purchaser for accurate volumetric  cost and sales information and for payments 
although the company has made year inquiries of such operators and purchasers and generally received satisfactory responses  there can be no assurance that such operators and purchasers will actually be year compliant 
if such is the case  the company could find a major portion of its production revenue held in escrow until year compliance was achieved or resulting litigation settled 
the related legal cost and resulting administrative confusion could be substantial 
the company expects to make any necessary contingency plans in fiscal in the event of non compliance of its systems  customers or suppliers 
the company and its subsidiaries are not aware of any material year operational risks 
exploration and production price risk the company has not hedged its existing oil and gas price production and is thus exposed to oil and gas price risk 
most of the company s oil and gas sales are at spot prices 
if such spot prices decrease  the company s sales and operating income from oil and gas sales will likewise decrease 
exploration and production drilling and production risk the company is subject to reserve and price risk on the oil and gas properties it owns 
reserve risk is the possibility that the reserves produced will not approximate the reserves the company has estimated 
price risk is the possibility that the price the company receives for its production will vary from current oil gas prices 
since the company has not hedged its future production  changes in oil and gas prices will affect cash flow from its exploration and production operations 
if oil and gas prices are lower than expected  cash flow will be less than that anticipated above 
the company is currently considering several oil and gas reserve acquisitions through purchase or new drilling 
although the company s management estimates the proved reserves associated with such acquisitions  there can be no assurance that production or related oil and gas reserves will be as estimated 
furthermore  such reserve risk also applies to the company s existing reserves 
production and resulting cash flow may vary significantly from the company s estimates and those of its independent petroleum reservoir engineer 
other risks uprc has recently terminated several employees responsible for the uprc deliveries of the company s gas to lone star 
if deliveries to lone star are hindered by uprc s reduced workforce or related pipeline operational problems  the company could fail to deliver amounts of gas nominated by lone star and by so doing lose the high gross margins realized on the sale of such gas 
the company has assumed that its note due from penn octane will be paid on its extended due date  june  interest on the note has been paid to june  but not thereafter 
penn octane failed to pay it the note on its original due date  june  although the company received an assignment of a judgement due to penn octane from a bank in return for extending the due date of the note to june   there can be no assurance that the company will ultimately collect the note 
in such case the estimated cash flow will be adversely affected 
in addition to the specific risks noted above  the company is subject to general business risks  including insurance claims in excess of insurance coverage  tax liabilities resulting from tax audits  drilling risks that new drilling will result in dry holes or marginal wells and the risks and costs of unending litigation 
if any or several of these risks materialize  the company s estimated cash flow and results of operations will probably be adversely impacted and the impact may be material 
the estimated cash flow above assumes none of these risks materializes 
given the number and variety of risks and the litigiousness of today s corporate world  it is reasonably possible that one or more of these risks may occur 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk one of the company s subsidiaries has hedged all of the gas it must purchase for the remaining term of the lone star contract and the contract with mgng 
the subsidiary used fixed price swaps to hedge such gas 
the subsidiary purchases gas on the open market and pays the trading party if the market price is below the fixed price or is paid by the trading party if the market price exceeds the fixed price 
the result is that the company s subsidiary has essentially fixed the price of future gas purchases and is not subject to commodity price risk related to its gas marketing activities 
the subsidiary continues to be exposed to the difference between the wellhead gas price and the price used in the hedge but such differences are expected to be immaterial 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
inflation and changing prices natural gas marketing the company s gas sales contract with lone star is essentially a fixed price contract 
it continues through may the company s gas supply contract with mgng is also a fixed price contract 
the result is that the company s gross margin is essentially locked in and does not change with inflation 
the company s gas sales contract with mgng is also at a fixed price 
the company has hedged all of the gas supplies needed for this contract at a price in excess of that received from mgng 
as a result  the company s gross margins on the gas contract with mgng is also locked in and not subject to inflation and changing prices 
although there are some operating costs applicable to the natural gas marketing segment  which tend to increase or decrease with inflation  these are minor and inflation of such costs without concomitant inflation in revenues does not significantly impact operating profits 
exploration and production oil and gas sales are determined by markets locally and worldwide and often move inversely to inflation 
whereas operating expenses related to oil and gas sales may be expected to parallel inflation  such costs have often tended to move more in response to oil and gas sales prices than in response to inflation 
new accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no

the company has adopted sfas for the fiscal year ending september  and has recomputed eps for fiscal and in accordance with sfas in june  fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no

the components of comprehensive income refer to revenues  expenses  gains and losses that are excluded from net income under current accounting standards  including foreign currency translation items  minimum pension liability adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on certain investments in debt and equity securities 
sfas requires that all items recognized under accounting standards as components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement displayed in equal prominence with the other financial statements  the total of other comprehensive income for a period is required to be transferred to a component of equity that is separately displayed in a statement of financial condition at the end of an accounting period 
sfas is effective for both interim and annual periods for companies having fiscal years beginning after december  reclassification of financial statements for earlier periods provided for comparative purposes is required 
the company will adopt sfas for the fiscal year ending september  in june  fasb issued financial accounting standards board no

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  was issued by the financial accounting standards board in june sfas standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts 
under the standard  entities are required to carry all derivative instruments in the statement of financial position at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value ie  gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and  if so  on the reason for holding it 
if certain conditions are met  entities may elect to designate a derivative instrument as a hedge of exposures to changes in fair values  cash flows  or foreign currencies 
if the hedged exposure is a fair value exposure  the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged 
if the hedged exposure is a cash flow exposure  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported initially as a component of other comprehensive income outside earnings and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
any amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness  as well as the ineffective portion of the gain or loss  is reported in earnings immediately 
accounting for foreign currency hedges is similar to the accounting for fair value and cash flow hedges 
if the derivative instrument is not designated as a hedge  the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change 
the company expects to adopt sfas in fiscal to date all hedging by the company has been applicable to the company s gas marketing operations 
those operations are expected to end on may  when the related gas contracts terminate 
as a result  the company believes sfas will not affect existing operations and cannot make a determination as to whether it will effect future operations until it engages in such operations 
the company believes that adoption of these financial accounting standards will not have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations
