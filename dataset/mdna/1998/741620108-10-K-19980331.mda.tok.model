two senior executives resigned  and lennart mengwall  a principal at avix with years of experience in the information technology industry  was thereafter appointed the new chairman and  subsequently  chief executive officer of the company

at the same time  the company was re organized into two distinct business units the consulting services group csg and the software products group spg 
the company believed that a re organization into two separate business units would allow each business to focus on its core competencies 
late in the first quarter of  the company made a decision to unify its two business units into a single organization focused on delivering e business solutions 
as a result  the company s management does not anticipate the future marketing of stand alone software product offerings 
accordingly  management can not currently anticipate revenue levels 
however  management does anticipate incurring significant expenses as the company attempts to grow its sales and consulting staff

see note d of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has a limited operating history upon which to base an evaluation of the company and its prospects 
the company and its prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in early stages of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets and technologies 
to address these risks  the company must  among other things  grow the consulting business  respond to competitive developments  successfully adjust the company s strategy to changes in the marketplace  identify channels for the company s services  continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified management and other employees  and remain knowledgeable with new and emerging technologies 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in addressing such risks 
the company has achieved only limited revenues to date and its ability to generate significant revenues is subject to substantial uncertainty 
the limited operating history of the company makes the prediction of future results of operations difficult and therefore  there can be no assurance that the company will sustain revenue growth or achieve profitability 
the company has incurred net losses since inception and expects to continue to incur losses on a quarterly and annual basis for the foreseeable future 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is possible that in some future quarter  the company s operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock may be materially adversely affected
