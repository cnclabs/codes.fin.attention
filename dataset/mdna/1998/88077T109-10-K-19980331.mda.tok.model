item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview results of continuing operations in and consist of o the fiber optic multiplexer and special services switch businesses of intelect network technologies company int from its april  acquisition  o the engineering services business of dna enterprises  inc dna from its february  acquisition  o the video conferencing system business of intelect visual communications corp 
ivc from its march  acquisition  and o the information security business of intelect europe limited iel from its august  acquisition until its liquidation in january during the year ended october   the company was engaged in the manufacturing and marketing of sporting arms  through its subsidiary savage arms  inc savage 
the results of operations of savage are accounted for as discontinued operations due to the sale of savage on october  the company s fiscal year was changed to december in accordingly  due to the disposition of savage  the change in fiscal year  and the schedule of acquisitions above  any comparison of financial results of to would not be meaningful to determine a trend 
the following table shows the revenue and gross profits for the company s products years ended two months ended year ended december december october thousands revenue fiber optic multiplexers  engineering services and dsp   video conferencing voice switching and other    gross profit loss fiber optic multiplexers  engineering services and dsp  video conferencing voice switching and other  revenues revenues in increased over due to large scale installation of sonetlynx products in foreign and domestic markets and due to the near doubling of the dna engineering services business 
the sonetlynx fiber optic multiplexer was delivered to five end user customers in korea  to a private network project on the alyeska pipeline  and to other applications such as smart highways and municipal networks for video arraignment 
due to a low base of sales in  the percentage increase is not a reasonable indicator of the future 
sales in included  of multiplexer products delivered for installation in korean networks for telecommunications  banking  and other applications 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
in light of the difficulties which developed in general in korean and other asian financial markets at year end  the outlook for continuation of sales in those areas has become uncertain 
the company has shipped  of product to korean customers between december  and march  the company s outlook for sales to non korean customers  especially in the us  is based on outstanding proposals and prospects of the company and its distribution partners 
there can be no assurance that such proposals and prospects will result in orders and revenues 
engineering service revenues of dna increased in over dsp product in the amount of  was shipped in compared to  in the company does not expect the growth of services revenue to continue at the same rate 
dsp product shipments may increase significantly  depending on customer reception to the company s designs and proposals and the funding of projects into which the products are specified 
video conferencing product revenues increased from a sampling level in to  in the growth of the product was delayed by a decision to discontinue the original licensed technology in favor of a new proprietary design based on wavelet technology 
the resultant new product was launched in november sales of s and predecessor products were  in  compared to  in since the s serves a limited market  prospects are uncertain for future sales increases 
other revenues in and late include information security products sold primarily to the uk military market 
these products were phased out in gross profit loss gross profit increased to  from a loss of  in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the largest contribution to the improvement came from sonetlynx fiber optic multiplexer products which achieved design stability and economic production levels in the second half of due to the interruption or delay of substantial shipments to korean customers at the beginning of  the level of margin contribution by the fiber optic products is uncertain in the near future 
the potential for sales to non korean customers could offset the effect of lower sales to korean customers 
however  there can be no assurance that such revenue and margin will materialize 
gross profit contribution by the engineering services business increased in  due primarily to the increase in revenue 
video conferencing products made a minor contribution to the total gross profit in both and due to the low sales level in both years  reflecting new product introductions in each year 
the loss on s switching products was reduced in due to the completion of certain loss contracts initiated in prior years 
approximately  of under absorbed manufacturing overhead costs  substantially all attributable to sonetlynx  were incurred to prepare for the large manufacturing growth rate during the year 
engineering and development e d expenses e d expense increased to  in from  in as a percentage of revenues  the expense declined to from 
spending in on cs and approximately  of other e d spending was dedicated to product development for which revenues were not realized during the year 
in both years  certain amounts of software development costs were capitalized 
including those amounts  gross spending on e d increased to  from  gross spending by product line was distributed as follows years ended december thousands fiber optic multiplexer   cs   video conferencing  dsp  s  and other  the sonetlynx fiber optic multiplexer product line was developed in with the following core components an oc controller  channel voice modules with fxs  fxo  and wire e m  channel t async  channel low speed data supporting four protocols  and a ring generator 
the product line was enhanced during by the addition of an oc controller  channel voice  channel t  and low speed data modules that can be configured for oc or oc operation  channel e async  channel t byte sync  video module with encoder decoder  a module combining precision timing sources with a single voice channel  and an oc multipoint ethernet module 
as a consequence of these developments  the sonetlynx product line has become a powerful and cost effective solution to the customer problem of access to fiber networks where many protocols are required 
the cs product was developed to a working prototype stage in and further developed and upgraded in to support the call capacity requirements of targeted market segments and anticipated applications 
spending on the video conferencing product in led to the emergence of a viable product built on purchased technology 
in  the product was redesigned around wavelet technology in order to deliver key performance features not otherwise achievable  namely  superior picture quality  application flexibility  and selectable bandwidth requirements 
in  two standard dsp board level products were developed using the texas instruments tmsc in  two dsp board level products based on the texas instruments tmsc were developed 
spending on the s product line in both years led to the completion of an improved console for air traffic control applications 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses were  and  in the years ended december  and selling expense increased to  from  the increase in was attributable to market development activity for sonetlynx and lanscape products and higher revenues for sonetlynx 
as a percentage of revenues  selling expense declined to from 
administrative expenses declined to  from  partly due to the removal of corporate headquarters from bermuda 
asset write downs in connection with the acquisition of ivc  certain assets and licenses  which constituted the design of a videoconferencing product  were purchased from a major computer company 
the design proved to be flawed and market introduction was delayed approximately nine months 
in  the company deemed the recoverability of ivc goodwill to be significantly impaired by the delay in introduction of the product to a rapidly changing market and accordingly reduced the carrying value of ivc goodwill by  its remaining unamortized net book value at the time and wrote off  of fixed assets deemed of no value 
the company s assessment of the future prospects for the information security products business in the united kingdom led to a complete shut down of those operations in chesterfield  england at the end of in january  liquidation proceedings began 
the company was an unsecured creditor of iel and wrote off all net assets related to those operations in england in the amount of interest expense interest expense of  and  in the years ended december  and consist of years ended december thousands interest on debt instruments non cash financing costs   other costs of financing  other interest interest on debt instruments in was primarily attributable to amounts borrowed from st 
james capital corp  two series of convertible debentures  and the coastal trust 
in  the interest was attributable to three series of convertible debentures 
non cash financing costs in were the result of warrants to purchase common stock issued in connection with various financings 
the reported expense amount is the value of the warrants determined by using the black scholes pricing model 
in  in addition to  of warrant values   of reportable expense was attributable to a beneficial conversion feature of the convertible debentures 
other costs of financing consist primarily of legal and placement fees 
income loss from discontinued operations the company sold savage corporation and its subsidiaries  including savage arms  inc savage on october  the results of savage are accounted for as discontinued operations and  accordingly  comparative presentations reflect the company s equity in the earnings of savage for the relevant periods 
the gain on the disposition of savage occurred in the fourth quarter of losses since october represent legal expenses in connection with the indemnity agreement with savage sports corporation 
see item  legal proceedings 
year compliance the company has conducted a review of its computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the year problem  the result of computer programs using two digits rather than four to define the year portion of dates 
the company has determined that no significant systems fail to comply with the ability to distinguish the year from the year the financial impact of year compliance has not been and is not anticipated to be material to the company s financial position or results of operations in any given year 
liquidity and capital resources in the year ended december   cash used in operations   and by investing activities   were funded by using  of available cash balances and by securing new financing  net of repayments  of  operating activities net cash used in operations consisted of the  net loss and the  net increase in current assets  offset by  of non cash charges 
as previously discussed  the net loss primarily reflects commitments to support new product development and to fund selling and manufacturing infrastructure development 
o accounts receivable increased  as required by the much higher level of sales and due to the length of payment schedules tied to major project installations and customer acceptance procedures 
o inventory increased  generally in line with the increased rate of product shipments 
o use of cash for accounts receivable and inventory growth was offset by the  increase in payables and accruals which grew in concert with the current assets 
o the cash effect of the net losses was mitigated by inclusion of  of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets and  of amortization of deferred financing costs 
investing activities investment spending included capital expenditures of  for fixed asset additions  primarily equipment for product testing and manufacturing  leasehold improvements  and computer equipment and software to support engineering and administrative activities 
software development costs of  were capitalized following establishment of feasibility of certain sonetlynx modules 
no software cost was capitalized after september financing activities cash used in operating and investing activities in were primarily financed by the following o  borrowed from st 
james capital corp  due march  o  borrowed from the coastal corporation second pension trust coastal trust  later converted to series a preferred stock o  from the sale of series a preferred stock to coastal trust o  from the exercise by coastal trust of a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock o  borrowed from coastal trust  due march  o  from the exercise by lifeline industries  inc of a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock o  from the exercise by st 
james capital corp 
of a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock o  from the sale of  shares of common stock in private placements o  from the exercise of employee stock options o  from the sale of series b preferred stock to navesink equity derivative fund  ldc o  borrowed from employees and affiliates of the company 
recent developments  outlook  and financial strategy in february  two additional financings were arranged 
 of series c preferred stock was sold to citadel investment group  llc and a  credit facility was arranged with st 
james capital  lp see note to consolidated financial statements 
 has been advanced under the credit facility 
the obligation to advance up to  expires after july  although advances under the  facility may be used to pay off the currently outstanding  and  notes due to st 
james capital corp 
and coastal trust  respectively  so long as any of the current obligations to st 
james capital corp 
and coastal trust are outstanding  st 
james capital lp must approve additional advances for any other purpose  which consent may not be unreasonably withheld 
the company s ability to incur debt  pay dividends on its common and preferred stock and to make certain investments and enter into certain transactions is governed by covenants and provisions in its various debt instruments and by the terms of its outstanding preferred stock  as described in notes   and to consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the external financings  the company has enhanced future cash flows by negotiating deferred payment arrangements with former owners of dna so that  formerly due on february  is payable in various monthly amounts through december the company currently believes that the prudent approach to cash planning should be predicated on a revenue pattern which declines in the first quarter of and increases thereafter 
under such a scenario  the need for inventory and receivable investment is moderated at the beginning of the year 
the credit facility with st 
james capital  lp is in place to pay the two debt obligations maturing on march   if required 
in order to offset the impact of further investment in cs product development  the company continues to seek an investment  distribution  and or marketing partner 
should the difficulties in korean markets continue  the company believes that  considering the number of prospects and the level of proposal activity  the opportunities are good for replacing sonetlynx sales concentrated with korean customers 
if  nevertheless  revenues do not recover in the near term  then cost reduction contingency plans are in place to preserve cash resources at lower levels of sales 
in the event the outlook for liquidity is stressed by production and sales growth in excess of current plans  the company believes the corporate financial environment will support new financing needs 
conclusion considering the financial resources available and potentially available  the outlook for cash available from customer collections  the outlook for cash uses in operations and investing  and the options available to control spending  the company believes it has  or reasonably has access to  the financial resources to meet its business requirements through the current year 
the company cannot assure  however  that the business results assumed in this outlook will be realized  especially considering the near term impact of reduced revenues from korea 
the company cannot assure that profitability and positive cash flow will be achieved when expected 
if the company s sales plans are not achieved  operating losses and negative cash flows exceed the company s estimates  or capital requirements in connection with the design  development  and commercialization of its principal products are higher than estimated  the company will need to raise additional capital 
although the company believes it could raise additional capital through public or private equity or debt financings  if necessary  there can be no assurance that such financings would be available  or available on acceptable terms 
if such financing were not available  the company has determined that a significant reduction of engineering  development  selling  and administrative costs would allow the company to continue as a going concern through contingent liabilities as discussed in item  legal proceedings  the company is exposed to certain contingent liabilities  which  if resolved adversely to the company  would adversely affect its liquidity  its results of operations and or its financial position
