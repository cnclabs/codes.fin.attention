financial services financial services revenues increased in compared to insurance management operations were up by as a result of a higher contingent fee  which was based on improved profits at the managed insurance company 
broker dealer revenues increased 
approximately of the increase was attributable to expanding the sales force with the opening of an additional office location 
the balance of the increase was primarily a result of lower interest rates creating more activity in the bond market 
financial services expenses increased from the increase reflects increased sales and expanded office operations at the broker dealer with the resultant higher commissions and payroll expense 
better control of legal costs and a lower allocation of corporate overhead partially offset the increases 
insurance mangement expenses decreased  again in the areas of legal and professional fees and allocated corporate overhead 
results in this segment can vary from year to year 
insurance management has a provision in its contract whereby it receives a portion of the managed insurance company s profits 
in the eight years under the contract  profit sharing has ranged from zero to of the segment s revenues 
the broker dealer  primarily a provider of fixed income securities  is subject to general market conditions as well as interest rates and is in an industry characterized by competition for top producing brokers 
the broker dealer continually seeks quality brokers and has opened an office in another city in an effort to expand its recruiting and sales base 
real estate revenue decreased compared to the small decrease reflects greater utilization of the office building by the company and affiliates at lower rates than outside tenants 
the decrease in real estate expenses in reflects lower corporate overhead allocations 
investment and other the decline in investment and other income was primarily due to lower interest income  the result of a note receivable being on non accrual during all of on october   the company invested  in the common stock of con eco with a put option 
on november   the company exercised its put in exchange for a note receivable from con eco 
the company renegotiated the debt with con eco in november in connection with the renegotiation  the company extended the debt for two years and refinanced unpaid accrued interest  resulting in a new promissory note for  no interest income has been recognized by the company 
payments under the new note were scheduled to begin on january  but were delayed until march with the company s consent 
the march payment has been received  however  it is anticipated that con eco will be required to sell certain assets in order to meet its obligations to the company 
the company has declared con eco in default for failure to comply with certain non payment obligations  but believes its collateral position is sufficient to allow ultimate repayment of the debt 
general and administrative expenses the increase in expenses was a result of changes in accounting estimates rather than fundamental changes in operations 
s expenses reflected favorable adjustments to a contingency provision related to a guarantee  as well as favorable adjustments to allowances for doubtful accounts  a result of collecting the accounts 
no such adjustments were required in interest expense declined primarily due to paying off the company s real estate loan early in affiliates earnings from affiliates increased compared to prime medical continued to grow and did not have the substantial offering and acquisition expenses it incurred in as a result  the company s equity in earnings grew in partially offsetting this increase was a loss in equity earnings of syntera 
syntera was established in and the loss reflects start up and development costs incurred in this early phase 
prime had issued additional shares in reducing the company s ownership from to 
the company  through its status as prime s largest shareholder and through its representation on prime s board  continues to have significant influence at prime and accounts for its investment using the equity method 
compared to revenues from continuing operations decreased in compared to net income decreased and diluted earnings per share decreased 
the reasons for these changes are described below 
financial services financial services revenues declined in compared to insurance management operations were up by as a result of a higher contingent fee  which was based on improved profits at the managed insurance company 
broker dealer revenues declined 
approximately of the decline was from not being able to replace the sales of a key broker who left at the beginning of the balance of the decline was primarily attributed to higher interest rates  which reduced activity in the bond market 
financial services expenses declined from the decline reflects lower activity at the broker dealer where lower commissions  payroll  legal and office operations expenses combined for a decline compared to insurance management expenses increased  primarily in the areas of employment taxes and benefits and state taxes 
real estate revenue increased over the increase reflects rising lease rates in austin  texas 
the increase in real estate expenses reflects overall inflation from to investment and other the decline in investment and other income was primarily in the other category  where results included a favorable settlement of prior litigation 
no similar benefit was received in general and administrative expenses the decline in expenses was primarily a result of timing rather than fundamental changes in operations 
s expenses included a contingency provision established to guarantee a future yield on an account 
in  this contingency provision was adjusted downward as a result of the account s actual performance 
approximately of the change between and resulted from this contingency provision 
additionally  the successful collection of certain accounts receivable in caused the reversal in of an allowance for doubtful accounts  established in  and accounts for approximately of the change between and approximately of the decrease in expenses was from lower payroll costs 
costs were lower due to reduced performance based incentives  which are based on the company s pretax income and market price 
interest expense declined primarily due to reduced inventories at the broker dealer and the resultant reduction in margin borrowing 
affiliates earnings from affiliates decreased compared to prime medical grew dramatically in  but costs associated with acquisitions and a stock offering reduced the impact of the growth in prime medical s issuance of additional shares in reduced the company s ownership from to 
liquidity and capital resources net working capital was  and  at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in working capital resulted from current notes receivable being moved to long term  as a result of amended terms  and a significant increase in accrued liabilities related to the estimated disposal cost of the computer software segment 
equally significant  the company s million investment in syntera was funded from working capital and current operations 
historically  the company has maintained a strong working capital position and  using that base  has been able to satisfy its operational and capital expenditure requirements with cash generated from its operating and investing activities 
these same sources of funds have also allowed the company to pursue investment and expansion opportunities consistent with its growth plans 
in february  the company entered into a three year  revolving credit agreement with nationsbank of texas  na funds advanced under the agreement will bear interest at the prime rate less  such interest to be payable quarterly 
the company will pledge shares of prime medical to the bank as funds are advanced under the line 
no funds had been advanced as of the date of this report 
capital expenditures for equipment were   and  in   and  respectively 
in addition  the company improved or purchased office space in and for  and  respectively 
the company expects capital expenditures in to be within the range of the prior three years 
the company s ability to make scheduled payments of principal of  or to pay the interest on  or to refinance  its indebtedness  or to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on its future performance  which  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control 
based upon the current level of operations and anticipated revenue growth  management believes that cash flow from operations and available cash  together with available borrowings under its bank line of credit  will be adequate to meet the company s future liquidity needs for at least the next several years 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  that anticipated revenue growth and operating improvements will be realized or that future borrowings will be available under the line of credit in an amount sufficient to enable the company to service its indebtedness or to fund its other liquidity needs 
inflation the operations of the company are not significantly affected by inflation because  having no manufacturing operations  the company is not required to make large investments in fixed assets 
however  the rate of inflation will affect certain of the company s expenses  such as employee compensation and benefits 
year compliance the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the year approaches 
the year problem is pervasive and complex as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to the issue is whether computer systems will properly recognize data sensitive information when the year changes to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
the company anticipates that necessary actions to be year compliant will be performed internally in the ordinary course of business at a cost not expected to exceed  however  significant uncertainty exists concerning the potential costs and effects associated with any year compliance 
any year compliance problem of either the company or its vendors  third party payors or customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  financial condition and prospects
