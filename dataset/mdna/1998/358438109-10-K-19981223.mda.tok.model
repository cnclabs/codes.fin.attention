liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  net cash used in the company s operating activities was million compared to  and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
despite the company s ability to generate net income in all three fiscal years  the company continued to use cash in its operations 
cash used in operations was the result of the growth in accounts receivable and inventories  both principally from the net addition of stores in fiscal  stores in fiscal and stores in fiscal cash used in operations was also affected by a decrease in accounts payable in fiscal compared to increases in accounts payable in fiscal and fiscal to the extent that the company continues to expand rapidly  it will continue to experience significant increases in credit sales and related increases in customer accounts as well as increases in inventories  which will likely result in a net use of cash from operations 
investing activities used cash of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company added net new stores in fiscal at a cost of approximately million 
the company spent million in fiscal and million in fiscal for the net addition of stores and stores  respectively 
in addition  during fiscal  the company invested million in crescent jewelers inc and its wholly owned subsidiary crescent jewelers together crescent  a privately owned west coast based specialty retailer of fine jewelry currently operating stores

additionally  during fiscal  the company purchased million principal amount of senior subordinated convertible notes the notes issued by crescent pursuant to a previously entered into standby purchase commitment 
based upon the most recent financial statements of crescent  crescent is in default under the term loan and the notes 
the company gave crescent notice of this default pursuant to provisions of the term loan agreement and the notes  and  as a result  the company will receive an increase in the interest rate of two percentage points on the outstanding indebtedness 
the company believes that the term loan and the notes are recoverable 
accordingly  no reserve for losses has been established for such notes as of september  it is possible that future events and circumstances could change this assessment 
financing activities provided million in cash in fiscal  million in cash in fiscal and million in cash in fiscal during fiscal and fiscal  the company had bank borrowings of million and million  respectively  at september  and  the company had million and million  respectively  available under its million revolving credit facility 
during fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities resulted from net proceeds of million from the company s public equity offering in june the net proceeds from this offering were used  in part  to repay million in subordinated debt and million in bank debt during fiscal on may   the company acquired all the rights of aa friedman co  inc of augusta  georgia aafco to the friedman s jewelers tradename 
the agreement between the company and aafco provides that the company pay aafco  shares of its class a common stock and that aafco will realize a minimum of million upon the sale of such shares during or prior to june prior to the sale of the shares  the company has agreed to make cash advance payments to aafco through an escrow arrangement which will pre fund the minimum sale proceeds 
during fiscal and fiscal  the company advanced million and million  respectively  in accordance with the agreement 
on july   the company entered into an million  two year revolving credit facility maturing on april   with its existing banks and an additional third institution the loan agreement 
effective august   the banks extended the maturity date to july  and provided a temporary increase to the facility of million 
the temporary increase to the credit line expires january  the borrowing rate for the credit facility is either the bank s offered rate plus  or at the company s option  libor plus 
the facility contains certain financial covenants and is secured by inventory and accounts receivable 
at september  and  million and million  respectively  were outstanding under the lines  with interest accruing on such borrowings in a range from to and to  respectively 
effective december   two of the banks agreed to extend the maturity date for million of the credit facility to january  in addition  all of the banks agreed to amend certain financial covenant targets and adjust the libor spread 
management believes that the company s credit facility will be sufficient to fund the company s working capital requirements through fiscal the company s current plans are to have between and stores in operation for the christmas season 
the capital required to fund this expansion  principally to finance inventory  fixtures and leasehold improvements  is estimated to be million and is intended to be provided by the company s revolving credit facility 
on november   the company announced that its board of directors had approved the repurchase of up to million of its outstanding class a common stock for a period of up to one year after such date 
the repurchases will be made in the open market through block purchases or in privately negotiated transactions  at the discretion of management and pursuant to applicable securities rules 
the company intends to finance the repurchases from cash flow from operations and availability under its existing credit facility 
seasonality the company has in the past experienced a well defined seasonality in its business with respect to both total revenues and profitability 
generally  the company experiences substantially increased sales volume in the days preceding major holidays  including christmas  valentine s day and mother s day 
due to the impact of the christmas shopping season  the company experiences the strongest results of operations in the first quarter of its fiscal year 
if for any reason the company s sales were below those normally expected for the first quarter  the company s annual results could be materially adversely affected 
the seasonality of the company s business puts a significant demand on working capital resources to provide for an inventory buildup for the christmas season 
furthermore  the christmas season typically leads to a seasonal buildup of customer receivables that are paid down during subsequent months 
however  to the extent that the company s expansion program continues  it can be expected that increased levels of accounts receivable related to such expansion may affect the historical seasonal decline in customer receivables 
inflation the impact of inflation on the company s operating results has been moderate in recent years  reflecting generally lower rates of inflation in the economy and relative stability in the prices of diamonds  gemstones and gold 
substantially all of the leases for the company s retail stores located in malls provide for contingent or volume related rental increases 
in prior years  the company has been able to adjust its selling prices to substantially recover increased costs 
while inflation has not had  and the company does not expect that it will have  a material impact upon operating results  there is no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
impact of year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company currently operates under two principal information systems i an accounting system that covers all financial information processes from the general ledger to the compilation of financial statements  and ii a retail system that covers the company s credit extension processes as well as inventory management and point of sale processes 
based on a recent assessment  the company determined that it will be required to modify or replace significant portions of its software so that these computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the accounting system required modifications that the company has completed and tested  although complete system wide implementation has not been completed 
with regard to the retail system  the company has decided to separate the credit processes and the inventory point of sale processes into separate systems 
the credit system will be comprised of a modified version of the current system 
the inventory point of sale system is a new system the company has purchased from a third party vendor 
all modifications and installations are expected to be completed in july the company presently believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company plans to initiate formal communications with all of its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the company s operations are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
the company does not utilize electronic data interchange with any of its suppliers  and  as a result  the company believes the risk of a year issue with its suppliers is limited 
the company s total year project cost and estimated timetable include the estimated costs and time associated with the impact of third party year issues based on presently available information 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted and would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems 
the company has determined it has no exposure to contingencies related to the year issue for the products it has sold 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  and test the software for year modifications 
the total cost of the year project is estimated at million and is being funded through operating cash flows 
of the total project cost  approximately  is attributable to the purchase of new software which will be capitalized 
the remaining  will be expensed as incurred and is not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations 
as of december   the company has incurred approximately   expensed and  capitalized for new systems related to the assessment of  and preliminary modification efforts on  its year project 
should the company s computers fail to function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter  the company believes that the decentralized nature of its store operations would allow it to continue to operate with limited interruption 
the primary effect of such a failure would be in the management of inventory levels in the stores and the billing of accounts receivable 
the company presently does not have but intends to develop a detailed contingency plan designed to address this possibility 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information fas  which is effective for fiscal year fas establishes standards for the way that public companies report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that those companies report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services and major customers 
the company will adopt the new requirements in annual financial statements in management has not completed its analysis of the effect of fas on its reported segments 
factors affecting future performance dependence on ability to grow and manage growth the number of stores we operate has increased greatly during the past three years 
for example  we opened approximately net new stores from december to december in order to meet our business objectives  we will need to continue to expand our store base during the success of our expansion program will depend on the performance of our existing stores  our ability to find suitable store locations and our ability to hire and train qualified store personnel 
we anticipate that there will continue to be significant competition among specialty retailers for desirable store sites and qualified personnel 
furthermore  if our operations fail to generate sufficient cash flow  we may require additional capital to finance our planned expansion 
our growth has placed  and will continue to place  significant demands on all aspects of our business  including our management information and distribution systems and personnel 
for these reasons  we may not be successful in continuing our growth or managing our growth 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to fund our growth  manage costs  adapt our operating systems  respond to changing business conditions or otherwise achieve or accommodate growth

competition the retail jewelry business is mature and highly competitive 
our retail jewelry business competes with national and regional jewelry chains  as well as with local independently owned jewelry stores and chains 
we also compete with other types of retailers who sell jewelry and gift items  such as department stores  catalog showrooms  discounters  direct mail suppliers and television home shopping networks 
our credit operations compete with credit card companies and other providers of consumer credit 
management believes that friedman s competes primarily on the basis of selection of merchandise offered  pricing  quality of sales personnel  advertising  ability to offer in house credit  store location and reputation 
many competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we do 
we may not be able to compete successfully with such competitors 
competition could cause us to lose customers  increase expenditures or reduce pricing which could have a material adverse effect on friedman s business or financial results 
see item business competition 
sensitivity to general economic conditions jewelry is not a necessity for people 
as a result  sales of jewelry may be particularly affected by adverse trends in the general economy  such as decreases in employment levels  wages and salaries 
historically  people have spent less money on luxury items  such as jewelry  during a decline in general economic activity 
sales of our jewelry are also adversely affected by negative developments in local economic conditions  such as plant closings  industry slowdown and government employment cutbacks 
we also depend on customer traffic at the power strip centers and malls where our stores are located 
a reduction in consumer spending due to general economic conditions could negatively affect friedman s results of operation or financial condition 
a majority of our customers use credit either from us or another consumer credit source to purchase jewelry from us 
when there are adverse trends in the general economy or increases in interest rates  fewer people use credit 
further  our credit operations are also affected by general economic trends 
any downturn in general or local economic conditions in the markets in which we operate would adversely affect our ability to collect outstanding credit accounts receivable 
during fiscal  we wrote off of our accounts receivable as a percentage of credit revenues 
see item selected financial data and item business credit operations 
seasonality and fluctuation in quarterly results our first fiscal quarter which ends december has historically been the strongest quarter of the year for friedman s in terms of net sales and operating income 
any substantial disruption of holiday season shopping or other events which affect our first quarter results could have a material adverse effect on our profitability for the whole year 
our quarterly results of operations also may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the following 
the timing of new store openings  
net sales contributed by new stores  
actions of competitors  
fluctuations in comparable store sales  
timing of certain holidays  
changes in our merchandise  and 
general economic  industry and weather conditions that affect consumer spending 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations seasonality 
dependence on key personnel our management and operations depend on the skills and experience of our senior management team  including our president and chief executive officer  bradley j 
stinn 
we believe that our ability to successfully implement our growth strategies depends on the continued employment of our senior management team 
the loss of mr 
stinn or a significant number of other senior officers could hurt us materially 
we do not have and do not contemplate entering into employment agreements with  or obtaining key man life insurance for  any senior officer 
see item a 
executive officers of the registrant 
potential effects of incentive compensation program on earnings in october  we made million in incentive loans to each of mr 
stinn and sterling b 
brinkley  our chairman of the board of directors 
we agreed to forgive principal and interest payments on these incentive loans if our class a common stock reached certain prices 
when we forgive principal and interest payments  we incur compensation expense which reduces earnings 
during and  we expensed million with respect to the incentive loans 
if the price of the class a common stock increases above the remaining price targets  we will incur an additional million in compensation expense 
this compensation expense  if incurred  will negatively impact earnings 
fluctuations in comparable store sales results one widely used measure of the performance of a retail company like friedman s is comparable store sales results 
variations in comparable store sales results could cause the price of the class a common stock to decrease or fluctuate substantially 
comparable store sales are affected by a variety of factors including 
local and general economic conditions  
the retail sales environment  and 
our ability to execute our business strategy efficiently 
comparable store sales decreased in fiscal there can be no assurance that comparable store sales will increase in any period 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
availability and prices of merchandise we primarily sell jewelry made of gold and diamonds and  to a lesser extent  other precious and semi precious metals and stones 
the prices of these materials have been  and we expect for them to continue to be  subject to significant volatility 
further  the supply and price of diamonds are significantly influenced by a single entity  debeers consolidated mines ltd 
of south africa 
we do not maintain long term inventories or otherwise hedge against fluctuations in the cost of gold or diamonds 
a significant increase in the price of gold and diamonds could adversely affect friedman s sales 
see item business purchasing 
our supply of diamonds comes primarily from south africa  botswana  zaire  the former soviet republics and australia 
changes in the social  political or economic conditions in one or more of these countries could have an adverse effect on our supply of diamonds 
any sustained interruption in the supply of diamonds from these producing countries could adversely affect us and the retail jewelry industry as a whole

concentration of control of friedman s mr 
phillip e 
cohen controls all of the class b common stock through his ownership of ms jewelers  the general partner of the partnership which owns the class b common stock 
the holders of class b common stock elect of our directors and control the outcome of all other issues decided by our stockholders  including major corporate transactions 
mr 
cohen can transfer the class b common stock and its voting rights to a third party  subject to certain limitations 
if mr 
cohen were to convert the class b common stock into class a common stock  he would control approximately of the class a common stock 
limited voting rights of class a common stock holders of class a common stock have the right to elect a minimum of of our directors 
as long as there are shares of class b common stock outstanding  holders of class a common stock have no other voting rights  except as required by law 
mr 
cohen  through the partnership  controls the outcome of substantially all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders 
some potential investors may not like this concentration of control and the price of class a common stock may be adversely affected 
mr 
cohen s control of friedman s may also discourage offers by third parties to buy us or to merge with us 
further  the interests of mr 
cohen could conflict with the interests of the holders of class a common stock 
government regulation federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations limit the manner in which we may offer and extend credit and insurance 
any adverse change in the regulation of credit could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
for example  new laws or regulations could limit the amount of interest or fees we could charge on consumer loan accounts  or restrict our ability to collect on account balances 
compliance with  or any violation of  existing and future laws or regulations could require us to make material expenditures or otherwise adversely effect our business or financial results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s market risk is limited to fluctuations in interest rates as it pertains to the company s borrowings under its credit facility 
the company pays interest on borrowings at either the lenders offered rate plus or  at the company s option  libor plus 
if the interest rates on the company s borrowings average basis points more in than they did in  the company s interest expense would increase and income before income taxes would decrease by  this amount is determined solely by considering the impact of the hypothetical change in the interest rate on the company s borrowing cost without consideration for other factors such as actions management might take to mitigate its exposure to interest rate changes
