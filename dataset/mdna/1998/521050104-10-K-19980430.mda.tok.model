results of operations the company substantially consummated the acquisition of stanley at the end of july  the stanley acquisition 
stanley has been reflected in layne christensen s results of operations beginning august  the stanley acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and will have a significant effect on layne christensen s future operations and on comparisons of income and expense items in future periods in relation to fiscal and the first six months of fiscal among other things  the company has incurred a substantial increase in long term debt and goodwill and will incur a substantial increase in interest expense and goodwill amortization in future periods 
with the recent stanley acquisition  the percentage of the company s revenues and operating income tied to the mining industry has increased substantially 
demand for the company s mineral exploration drilling services and products depends upon the level of mineral exploration and development activities conducted by mining companies  particularly with respect to gold and copper 
mineral exploration is highly speculative and is influenced by a variety of factors  including the prevailing prices for various metals which often fluctuate widely 
in this connection  the recent movement in the prices of gold and copper has adversely impacted the level of mineral exploration and development activities conducted by mining companies which  in turn  has adversely impacted the company s results for the fourth quarter of fiscal should the current trend in the price of precious and other metals continue  it could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results

comparison of fiscal to fiscal results of operations the company s results include the effect of the december merger with cbc the merger  a world leader in providing diamond core drilling services for mineral exploration and among the largest manufacturers of diamond core bits  core barrels  drilling rigs and related equipment used by the mining industry 
the merger was treated as a purchase for financial accounting purposes  and accordingly the results of operations include cbc from the acquisition date 
revenues for fiscal increased  or to  from fiscal water well drilling and maintenance revenues increased to  for fiscal compared to revenues of  for fiscal the company believes the increase in water well drilling revenues for the year was mainly the result of continued increases in domestic municipal spending in certain areas of the united states combined with increased sales of water well equipment

environmental drilling revenues decreased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal the company believes the decrease for the year was mainly the result of a continuing soft market for the environmental services offered by the company 
product sales increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal  as a result of the domestic production facilities of cbc acquired in the merger 
gross profit margin was for compared to for the increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to increased margins on product sales as a result of sales of drilling equipment and bits from manufacturing facilities acquired in the merger which had higher gross profit margins than those associated with the company s products distribution business

income taxes of  for fiscal increased from  for fiscal as a result of higher income before taxes compared to the prior year 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal this improvement in the company s effective tax rate was a result of the tax treatment of the company s earnings from foreign affiliates acquired through the merger 
us federal income taxes are generally not provided by the company on the equity earnings of the affiliates as foreign tax credits should become available under current tax law to significantly reduce or eliminate the resulting us income tax liability 
fluctuation in quarterly results the company historically has experienced fluctuations in its quarterly results arising from the timing of the award and completion of contracts  the recording of related revenues and unanticipated additional costs incurred on projects 
the company s revenues on large drilling contracts are recognized on a percentage of completion basis for individual contracts based upon the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion 
contract price and cost estimates are reviewed periodically as work progresses and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in contract revenues and gross profit in the reporting period when such estimates are revised 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
a significant number of the company s contracts contain fixed prices and assign responsibility to the company for cost overruns for the subject projects  as a result  revenues and gross margin may vary from those originally estimated and  depending upon the size of the project  variations from estimated contract performance could affect the company s operating results for a particular quarter 
many of the company s contracts are also subject to cancellation by the customer upon short notice with limited damages payable to the company 
in addition  adverse weather conditions  natural disasters  force majeure and other similar events can curtail company operations in various regions of the world throughout the year  resulting in performance delays and increased costs 
moreover  the company s domestic drilling activities and related revenues and earnings tend to decrease in the winter months when adverse weather conditions interfere with access to drilling sites and the ability to drill  as a result  the company s revenues and earnings in its second and third quarters tend to be higher than revenues and earnings in its first and fourth quarters 
accordingly  as a result of the foregoing as well as other factors  quarterly results should not be considered indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any full fiscal year

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks to which the company is exposed are interest rates on variable rate debt  equity risk on investments  and foreign exchanges rates giving rise to translation and transaction gains and losses 
the company centrally manages its debt and investment portfolios considering overall financing strategies and tax consequences 
the company generally does not use derivative financial instruments as part of its overall strategies and has no such instruments outstanding at the present time 
the company s variable rate debt is described in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing on page of this form k which is incorporated herein by this reference 
assuming january  debt levels  an instantaneous change in interest rates of one percentage point would impact the company s interest expense by  the company s investments are described in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing on page of this form k which is incorporated herein by this reference 
the investments are carried at market value and are held for long term investing purposes rather than trading purposes 
operating in international markets involves exposure to possible volatile movements in currency exchange rates 
currently  the company s primary international operations are in australia  africa  mexico  canada  indonesia and thailand 
the operations are described in notes and to the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing on pages and  respectively  of this form k which are incorporated herein by this reference 
the majority of the company s contracts in africa and mexico are us dollar based  providing a natural reduction in exposure to currency fluctuations 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of the company s international operations into us dollars may affect year to year comparability of operating results 
we estimate that a ten percent change in foreign exchange rates would have impacted operating income for the year ended january  by approximately  this represents approximately ten percent of the international segment operating profit after adjusting for primarily us dollar based operations 
this quantitative measure has inherent limitations  as it does not take into account any governmental actions  changes in customer purchasing patterns or changes in the company s financing and operating strategies 
foreign exchange gains and losses in the company s statements of income reflect transaction gains and losses and translation gains and losses from the company s mexican subsidiary  which uses the us dollar as its functional currency 
net foreign exchange gains and losses for  and were not significant
