possible environmental liabilities under various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  such as the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or cercla  and common law  an owner or operator of real estate is liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on or in such property as well as certain other costs  including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property 
such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances 
the presence of such substances  or the failure to remediate such substances properly  may adversely affect the owner s or operator s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral 
persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at a disposal or treatment facility  whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person 
certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestos containing materials acm  and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real property for personal injuries associated with acm 
a number of properties contain acm or material that is presumed to be acm 
in connection with the ownership and operation of its properties  the company may be liable for such costs 
in addition  it is not unusual for property owners to encounter on site contamination caused by off site sources  and the presence of hazardous or toxic substances at a site in the vicinity of a property could require the property owner to participate in remediation activities in certain cases or could have an adverse effect on the value of such property 
in a few situations  contamination from adjacent properties has migrated onto property owned by the company  however  based on current information  management of the company does not believe that any significant remedial action is necessary at these affected sites 
as of the date hereof  substantially all of the properties have been subjected to a phase i environmental assessment and or assessment update 
these assessments have not revealed  nor is management of the company aware of  any environmental liability that it believes would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  operations or liquidity taken as a whole 
this projection  however  could prove to be incorrect depending on certain factors 
for example  the company s assessments may not reveal all environmental liabilities  or may underestimate the scope and severity of environmental conditions observed  with the result that there may be material environmental liabilities of which the company is unaware  or material environmental liabilities may have arisen after the assessments were performed of which the company is unaware 
in addition  assumptions regarding groundwater flow and the existence and source of contamination are based on available sampling data  and there are no assurances that the data is reliable in all cases 
moreover  there can be no assurance that i future laws  ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability or ii the current environmental condition of the properties will not be affected by tenants  by the condition of land or operations in the vicinity of the properties  or by third parties unrelated to the company 
some tenants use or generate hazardous substances in the ordinary course of their respective businesses 
these tenants are required under their leases to comply with all applicable laws and are responsible to the company for any damages resulting from the tenants use of the property 
the company is not aware of any material environmental problems resulting from tenants use or generation of hazardous substances 
there are no assurances that all tenants will comply with the terms of their leases or remain solvent and that the company may not at some point be responsible for contamination caused by such tenants 
compliance with the americans with disabilities act under the americans with disabilities act the ada  all public accommodations and commercial facilities are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
these requirements became effective in compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of access barriers  and non compliance could result in imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants 
although the company believes that the properties are substantially in compliance with these requirements  the company may incur additional costs to comply with the ada 
although the company believes that such costs will not have a material adverse effect on the company  if required changes involve a greater expenditure than the company currently anticipates  the company s results of operations  liquidity and capital resources could be materially adversely affected 
impact of year issue the year issue is a general term used to describe the various problems that may result from the improper processing of dates and calculations involving years by many computers throughout the world as the year is approached and reached 
the company has reviewed the impact of year issues and does not expect any remedial actions taken with respect thereto to materially adversely affect its business  operations or financial condition 
fasb statement no 
in  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 earnings per share  which is effective for financial statements for periods ending after december  fasb statement no 
requires the restatement of prior period earnings per share and requires the disclosure of additional supplemental information detailing the calculation of earnings per share 
fasb statement no 
replaced the calculation of primary and fully diluted earnings per share with basic and diluted earnings per share 
unlike primary earnings per share  basic earnings per share excludes any dilutive effects of options  warrants and convertible securities 
diluted earnings per share is very similar to the previously reported fully diluted earnings per share 
it is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock and the dilutive effect of options  warrants and convertible securities outstanding  using the treasury stock method 
earnings per share data is required for all periods for which an income statement or summary of earnings is presented  including summaries outside the basic financial statements 
all earnings per share amounts for all periods presented have  where appropriate  been restated to conform to the fasb statement no 
requirements 
funds from operations and cash available for distributions the company considers funds from operations ffo to be a useful financial performance measure of the operating performance of an equity reit because  together with net income and cash flows  ffo provides investors with an additional basis to evaluate the ability of a reit to incur and service debt and to fund acquisitions and other capital expenditures 
ffo does not represent net income or cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
it should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
ffo does not measure whether cash flow is sufficient to fund all cash needs including principal amortization  capital improvements and distributions to stockholders 
further  ffo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to the company s calculation of ffo  as described below 
ffo and cash available for distributions should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indication of the company s performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
ffo means net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
in march  the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit issued a clarification of the definition of ffo 
the clarification provides that amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non real estate assets are no longer to be added back to net income in arriving at ffo 
cash available for distribution is defined as funds from operations reduced by non revenue enhancing capital expenditures for building improvements and tenant improvements and lease commissions related to second generation space 
ffo and cash available for distribution for the years ended december  and are summarized in the following table in thousands year ended december  ffo income before minority interest and extraordinary item   add deduct dividends to preferred shareholders  depreciation and amortization   minority interest in crocker depreciation and amortization third party service company cash flow ffo before minority interest   cash available for distribution add deduct rental income from straight line rents   amortization of deferred financing costs   non incremental revenue generating capital expenditures building improvements paid   second generation tenant improvements paid   second generation lease commissions paid   cash available for distribution   weighted average shares units outstanding basic   weighted average shares units outstanding diluted   dividend payout ratio ffo cash available from distribution assumes redemption of common units for shares of common stock 
minority interest common unit holders and the stockholders of the company share equally on a per common unit and per share basis  therefore  the per share information is unaffected by conversion 
inflation in the last five years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of the relatively low inflation rate in the company s geographic areas of operation 
most of the leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in addition  many of the leases are for terms of less than seven years  which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at a higher base if rents on the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
disclosure regarding forward looking statements the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their companies without fear of litigation so long as those statements are identified as forward looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the statement 
accordingly  the company hereby identifies the following important factors that could cause the company s actual financial results to differ materially from those projected by the company in forward looking statements i unexpected increases in development of office or industrial properties in the company s markets  ii deterioration in the financial condition of tenants  iii construction costs of properties exceeding original estimates  iv delays in the completion of development projects or acquisitions  v delays in leasing or releasing space  vi incorrect assessments of or changes in the environmental condition of the company s properties  vii unexpected increases in interest rates  and viii loss of key executives
