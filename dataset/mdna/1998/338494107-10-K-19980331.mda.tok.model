air seal produces customized mid range housings and hvac equipment 
precisionaire manufactures air filters and related products for commercial and residential air conditioning and heating systems 
the company also established two new subsidiaries in fil and airpure west 
fil is a singapore based sales and marketing subsidiary marketing the company s products to customers in the pacific rim 
in  airpure west s operations were moved to the company s newly opened henderson  nevada  manufacturing and distribution facility 
as of march  the company acquired the majority of the assets of bb d and placed them in a newly formed  majority owned subsidiary  airseal west 
airseal west sells  manufactures and distributes specialty and standard air filter housings and hvac systems in the western united states 
as of december  the company acquired gfi  inc in a stock for stock exchange 
gfi manufactures glass based filter media and specialty air filters 
the results of operations for the acquired businesses are included in the company s financial statements only from the applicable date of acquisition 
as a result  the company s historical results of operations for the periods presented should be evaluated specifically in the context of the acquisitions 
additionally  the historical results of operations do not fully reflect the operating efficiencies and improvements expected from upgrading and integrating the acquired businesses into the company s operations 
there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to achieve these objectives and gains in efficiency 
the company believes the acquisitions will have a positive impact on its future results of operations 
results of operations fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december the following table summarizes the company s results of operations as a percentage of net sales for the fiscal years ended december  and fiscal year ended december  december  s omitted net sales   gross profit   operating expenses   operating income   income before income taxes   income taxes   net income   net sales net sales for increased by  or  to  from  for the increase in net sales was due to the acquisitions and establishment of new subsidiaries  which contributed approximately  of net sales 
excluding the acquisitions  comparable sales from the company s business at december  to december  were up approximately  or 
the company attributes this slowdown in growth to a cyclical downturn in demand for new semiconductor production facilities 
because of this cyclical slowdown  the company has redirected underutilized capacity normally utilized in the manufacture of high end filtration products for semiconductor cleanrooms to containment environments for the pharmaceutical industry 
see industry outlook 
gross profit gross profit for increased by  or  to  which represented of net sales  from  in  which represented of net sales 
the primary reasons for the decrease in gross margin percentage were i higher than normal costs associated with opening new facilities in momence  illinois and henderson  nevada  which consisted primarily of labor inefficiencies associated with training new production employees  ii higher than normal freight costs associated with shipping products from facilities on the east coast to meet demand from new customers while the new facilities were in their startup phase  and iii higher than normal costs associated with changing portions of the company s high end production facilities to emphasize production of containment environments for the pharmaceutical industry instead of hepa filters for the semiconductor industry 
see industry outlook 
operating expenses operating expenses for increased by  or  to  which represented of net sales  from  in  which represented of net sales 
the primary reasons for the overall increase in operating expenses were the acquisitions and the establishment of airseal west  which accounted for  of the increase 
operating expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales compared to  primarily due to the impact of savings associated with the consolidation of operations of the various subsidiaries 
other factors affecting operating expenses included an increase in sales commissions related to the increase in sales volume  additional travel and management expenses associated with establishing new facilities  and expenses incurred developing and marketing new containment and filtration products

the dispute involves hepa filters manufactured by the company on behalf of a customer to conform to certain specifications 
based on independent testing performed on such filters and other relevant information  the company believes its receivable is valid and collectible 
nevertheless  it is reasonably possible that the company s estimate of collection could be reduced significantly in the near term 
the majority of the company s sales are on terms ranging from to days  and the typical days outstanding for payment of the company s invoices ranges from to days 
net cash provided by operating activities was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company s investing activities consumed  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively

the company has arranged a revolving line of credit facility with suntrust 
the credit agreement is for a term of two years and provides the company with a line of credit up to a maximum principal amount of  outstanding balances on the credit line bear interest at the option of the company  at either a the prime rate of interest publicly announced by suntrust bank  or b the libor rate as reported by the wall street journal plus an amount equal to to  depending on the ratio of total liabilities of the company to its tangible net worth  as of december   this rate would be 
as of december   the company had used none of the revolving credit facility 
in september  the company sold  principal amount of convertible notes pursuant to regulation s to certain unrelated offshore investors 
as of december   such holders have converted all of the convertible notes into an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
continuing expansion of the company will require substantial capital investment for the manufacture of filtration products 
although the company has been able to arrange debt facilities or equity financing to date  there can be no assurance that sufficient debt financing or equity will continue to be available in the future  or that it will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
failure to obtain sufficient capital could materially adversely impact the company s growth strategy 
the company recently purchased the illinois property for a new mid range manufacturing facility 
the company agreed to assume all risk of environmental liability for past  present or future conditions on the illinois property except liability related to ground water environmental problems 
the illinois property had certain environmental problems which required remediation under federal and illinois law 
the seller of the illinois property has worked extensively with the iepa with regard to the environmental matters  and the company has completed phase i and a phase ii environmental surveys with respect to the property  and it appears that the environmental matters have been resolved  except for certain monitoring procedures required by the iepa 
however  resolution of state issues has no effect on any potential federal or common law claims  and there can be no assurance that such claims will not be made 
the company s business and operations have not been materially affected by inflation during the periods for which financial information is presented 
subsequent events in february  the company acquired  through ffi  certain assets and assumed certain liabilities from enviro spin technologies  inc enviro spin 
in connection with such acquisition  ffi also entered into a license agreement with enviro spin in which enviro spin licensed to ffi the right to utilize enviro spin s technologies and processes to produce and sell certain bonded carbon products 
the purchase price for such acquisition was  the company also agreed to pay an initial license fee of  plus royalty payments equal to of sales of certain products up to a maximum of  enviro spin manufactures  builds and designs bonded carbon panel filters 
outlook issues and uncertainties this outlook section  and other sections of this document  contains many forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  including  among others i results of operations including expected changes in the company s gross margin and general  administrative and selling expenses  ii the company s business strategy for expanding its market share of the air filtration industry iii the company s strategy to increase the size and customer base of the air filtration market  and iv the company s ability to distinguish itself from its current and future competitors 
these forward looking statements are based largely on the company s current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from these forward looking statements 
important factors to consider in evaluating such forward looking statements include i the shortage of reliable market data regarding the air filtration market  ii changes in external competitive market factors or in the company s internal budgeting process which might impact trends in the company s results of operations  iii anticipated working capital or other cash requirements  iv changes in the company s business strategy or an inability to execute its strategy due to unanticipated changes in the market  v product obsolescence due to the development of new technologies  and vi various competitive factors that may prevent the company from competing successfully in the marketplace 
in light of these risks and uncertainties  there can be no assurance that the events contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this form k will in fact occur 
additionally  while management of flanders is optimistic about the company s long term prospects  the following issues and uncertainties  among others  should be considered in evaluating the company s prospects 
integration of acquired companies 
prior to their acquisition by the company in  csc  air seal and precisionaire operated under different management philosophies  management teams and marketing strategies 
these companies operations are currently being integrated into the company s and there can be no assurance that the company s systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to accommodate integration of these companies 
failure to successfully integrate these companies could materially adversely affect the company s business and results of operation 
management of growth 
with the company s recent acquisitions  the company s net sales increased by approximately from the year ended december  to the year ended december   and approximately from the year ended december  to the same period ended december  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to expand at this rate  or at all 
additionally  the company plans to continue opening new facilities and has recently opened three new facilities 
if the company continues to grow  the additional growth will place burdens on management to manage such growth while maintaining the company s profitability 
additional growth may require the company to recruit and train additional management personnel in the areas of corporate management  sales  accounting  marketing  research and development and operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so 
both the company s growth by acquisition and expansion may also significantly strain the company s management  financial and other resources 
there can be no assurance that the company s systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support the company s operations and growth 
acquisition strategy 
the company intends to continue to seek increased market share through strategic acquisitions of synergistic businesses 
the company seeks to identify potential acquisition targets with i dominant positions in local or regional markets  ii excess or under utilized capacity  iii an ability to add new product lines to the company s business  and iv significant asset value to enable the company to obtain debt financing or non diluted equity financing for such acquisition 
the company is continuously evaluating acquisition opportunities in light of the above criteria 
once a potential target is identified  the company commences an in depth due diligence evaluation of the target s operations  markets  profitability and examines all potential liabilities including environmental liabilities and any contingent liabilities 
the company s strategy of growth through acquisition exposes the company to the potential risks inherent in assessing the value  strengths  weaknesses  contingent or other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates and in integrating the operations of acquired companies 
additionally  an essential component of the company s acquisition strategy is improving the operating efficiency  output and capacity of each acquired company  and the facilities they operate 
this process may include the repair or replacement of outdated and inefficient equipment to improve the operations and output 
although the company generally has been successful in pursuing these acquisition targets  there can be no assurance that acquisition opportunities will continue to be available  that the company will have access to the capital required to finance potential acquisitions  that the company will continue to acquire businesses or that any business acquired will be integrated successfully or prove profitable 
other than a non binding letter of intent with eco air products  inc  the company has no specific agreements with respect to future acquisitions  but is continuing to investigate potential acquisition opportunities 
need for additional financing for future acquisitions 
the company believes that the revenues from current operations will provide the company with sufficient capital to fund continuing operations for the foreseeable future 
however  to continue its growth through acquisition  substantial additional debt or equity financing may be needed 
failure to obtain sufficient capital could materially adversely affect the company s acquisition strategy 
need for technical employees 
the company s future operating results depend in part upon its ability to retain and attract qualified engineering  manufacturing  technical  sales and support personnel for its operations 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel 
the failure to attract or retain such persons could materially adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
technological change  new product introduction 
as of december   approximately of the company s net sales resulted from sales of high end filtration products which are especially vulnerable to new technology development 
the company s ability to remain competitive will depend in part upon its ability to anticipate technological changes  to develop new and enhanced filtration systems and to introduce these systems at competitive prices in a timely and cost efficient manner 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully anticipate future technological changes or that technologies or systems developed by others will not render the company s technology obsolete 
the company also plans to develop new products as part of its strategy to increase the size and customer base of the air filtration market 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing the new products or that any product developed will be commercially viable 
acquiring and maintaining equipment 
the company designs  manufactures and assembles the majority of the automatic production equipment used in its facilities 
the company also uses other technologically advanced equipment  for which manufacturers may have limited production capability or service experience  which could result in delays in the acquisition and installation of such equipment or extended periods of down time in the event of malfunction or equipment failure 
any such extended period of down time for any critical equipment could have a material adverse impact on the company  its financial condition and operations 
product demand 
approximately of the company s net sales in were from high end products sold for use in the semiconductor industry 
the company believes that new fabricated plant construction for the semiconductor manufacturing industry  which typically occurs in large phases as new manufacturing capacity is brought on line  is in a periodic slowdown 
as such  the demand for the company s laminar flow hepa products may be less in future years than previous years 
potential environmental risks 
the company s business and products may be significantly influenced by the constantly changing body of environmental laws and regulations  which require that certain environmental standards be met and impose liability for the failure to comply with such standards 
while the company endeavors at each of its facilities to assure compliance with environmental laws and regulations  there can be no assurance that the company s operations or activities  or historical operations by others at the company s locations  will not result in civil or criminal enforcement actions or private actions that could have a materially adverse effect on the company 
competition 
the company currently faces significant competition in its business activities  and this competition may increase as new competitors enter the market 
several of these competitors may have longer operating histories and greater financial  marketing and other resources than the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully with existing or new entrant companies 
in addition  new product introductions or enhancements by the company s competitors could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of the company s existing products 
increased competitive pressure could also lead to intensified price based competition resulting in lower prices and profit margins  which could adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s success will depend in significant part upon the continued contributions of its officers and key personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
the company has entered into employment agreements with robert r 
amerson  its president  and steven k 
clark  its chief financial officer 
the loss of any key person could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations of the company 
distribution channels 
the acquisitions give the company a broader product line of air filtration products 
as part of the integration of the acquisitions  the company has adopted a strategy of increasing its market share by providing its manufacturers representatives with the ability to offer a full product line of the company s products and one stop purchasing of air filtration products to existing and new customers 
many of the company s representatives have indicated a willingness to offer the company s products exclusively now that the company offers a broader range of products  however  the company does not have any written agreements with such representatives that require exclusivity for the company s entire product line 
these representatives may decide to work exclusively with some other company for various reasons  thus  the current distribution channels would be unavailable 
automation 
the company has begun a program to increase its gross margins by automating portions of its production lines at ffi  precisionaire and airpure using technology developed at precisionaire and ffi 
currently  approximately of the company s production lines incorporate the new automated equipment designs 
the company will continue to implement the additional automation for these production lines one at a time  to minimize down time 
the company estimates the total cost for automation of its facilities will be approximately  and will fund such automation from funds raised in its recent public offering 
new markets 
the company intends to develop new markets and products for those markets by applying existing technology developed for high technology niche markets to new applications 
for each new application  the company will first develop a line of products to meet the needs of the specific application  and through trade shows  technical publications  mass marketing  distributor education and other appropriate methods  will create demand for the application in the new target market 
the company has established the absolute isolation division and the integrated environmental control division to focus on i methods to manufacture pharmaceutical and other products in synthesized atmospheres and completely isolated and secure environments using absolute isolation barriers and ii iaq diagnosis and solutions for commercial and public buildings and for residential application 
the company believes there will be an increase in interest in absolute isolation barriers in the future because these products prevent cross contamination between different products and different lots of the same product being manufactured at the same facility  as well as increase production yields 
additionally  the company believes there is an increase in public concern regarding the effects of iaq on employee productivity  as well as an increase in interest in standards for detecting and solving iaq problems 
the company will continue to concentrate its efforts on products with high replacement potential 
year the company is in the process of identifying operating and application software problems related to the year issue  both internally and externally 
the company expects to resolve its internal year compliance issues substantially through replacement and upgrades of software and hardware 
the company estimates it will spend approximately  to modify existing systems 
additionally  the company is working with third parties to resolve external year issues 
however  there can be no assurance that there will not be interruption of operations or other limitations of system functionality or that the company will not incur substantial costs to avoid such limitations 
any failure to effectively monitor  implement or improve the company s operational  financial  management and technical support systems could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and consolidated results of operations 
centralize overhead functions 
the company has begun to implement plans to centralize and eliminate duplication of efforts between its subsidiaries in the following areas purchasing  production planning  shipping coordination  marketing  accounting  personnel management  risk management and benefit plan administration 
the company believes this will have a beneficial impact upon its future operating results as these changes are phased in during the next year 
because of the foregoing factors  as well as other variables affecting the company s operating results  past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
industry outlook the company believes that the semiconductor industry has been experiencing a cyclical slowdown in capital spending for new facilities  and thus spending on filtration products  since the first quarter of while the company does expect capital spending for new semiconductor facilities to increase in the future  it does not expect this to be a significant factor in the company s overall business during  where sales for semiconductor plants are expected to remain flat 
because of this slowdown  the company has determined to utilize its excess production capacity and development resources toward the production and marketing of isolation environments to the semiconductor and pharmaceutical industries 
isolating critical process steps from contaminants and the outside environment may increase production yields and operator safety  while decreasing the costs and risks associated with environmental contamination 
the company estimates that industry wide  revenues from placing isolation environments in new and existing semiconductor and pharmaceutical production facilities could reach million during the next three years 
data collected by the company indicates that a residential filter user replaces their filters  on average  approximately once per year 
manufacturers of residential furnace and air condition systems recommend that these filters be changed every month 
a minor trend toward increased maintenance of these residential heating and cooling systems could have a positive impact on the company s business 
the company s most common products  in terms of both unit and dollar volume  are residential throw away filters  which usually sell for prices under 
any increase in consumer concern regarding air pollution  airborne pollens  allergens  and other residential airborne contaminants could result in replacement of some of these sales with higher value sales  such as the company s anti microbial or higher efficiency filters for residential use  with associated sales prices typically over each 
any such trend would have a beneficial effect on the company s business 
currently  the largest domestic market for air filtration products is for mid range ashrae rated products and hvac systems  typically used in commercial and industrial buildings 
to date  the company s penetration of this market has been relatively small  consisting of approximately million  or of net sales  in the company believes that its ability to offer a one stop supply of air filtration products to hvac distributors and wholesalers will increase its share of this market segment 
see distribution channels above 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  reporting comprehensive income 
this statement establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components revenues  expenses  gains and losses in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
comprehensive income is the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from nonowner sources 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company reclassified its financial statements for earlier periods that are provided for comparative purposes 
the company believes that this standard will not have any material effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows
