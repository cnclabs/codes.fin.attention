products at the present time  the company s principal products can be divided into three categories sleep products  respiratory products and asthma  allergy and oem products 
sleep products respironics believes it is the us market share leader in osa therapy devices  with a market share in excess of 
the company s primary osa therapy products are the great performers family  including the solo  remstar  aria and virtuoso cpap units and the duet bi level unit  the bipap s airway management system  the tranquility family of cpap and bi level units and related accessories such as masks  tubes  filters and headgear 
the company s cpap devices in both the great performer and tranquility families consist of a small  portable air pressurization device  an air pressure control and a mask worn by the patient at home during sleep 
the solo  remstar and tranquility cpap systems are low cost  innovative osa therapy devices that meet the company s strategy of offering units at all key price points 
the aria cpap system features built in memory to record patient usage data 
the software necessary to extract this data from the aria unit is known as encore 
the virtuoso and tranquility auto cpap systems utilize innovative technology to monitor the patient s airway and adjust output automatically in order to deliver the appropriate pressure 
the bipap duet airway management system  the tranquility bi level system  and the bipap s airway management system are the company s bi level osa units 
these units sense the patient s breathing cycle and adjust the pressure accordingly 
the duet unit also contains advanced leak sensing technology which improves the unit s pressure adjustment capability 
bi level units are used to treat severe osa and are useful in improving acceptance of therapy by patients who have difficulty tolerating cpap 
the great performers clinical system  consisting of the quartet clinical system  a bedside pressure generator and the maestro clinical remote control unit  is used by clinicians in prescribing therapy for the treatment of adult osa 
the company has received clearance from the united states food and drug administration fda for all of the great performers  tranquility and bipap s airway management products 
respironics also manufactures and distributes a wide range of technologically advanced computer based products for use in the diagnosis of sleep related disorders 
the company develops products for patient testing in the home which allow clinicians to expand the number of patients who can be served by a traditional sleep disorders laboratory 
the company also provides advanced  technically proficient clinical products for use in sleep disorders laboratories 
the company s primary sleep diagnostic product is the alice system 
alice is a computer based system for use in sleep laboratories and other clinical settings 
it is capable of recording up to channels of physiological data which are stored on either a desktop or portable computer prior to permanent storage on optical cartridges 
in addition to acquiring and storing the patient s physiological data  the alice system utilizes physician input and internal algorithms to provide a comprehensive range of reports for clinical analysis 
alice can be used on either infants or adults and separate software programs have been developed specifically for each type of patient 
the company also manufactures and markets nightwatch  a portable sleep system which monitors up to nine channels of physiological data for up to ten hours per patient 
among other factors  nightwatch is distinguished by a unique software algorithm for the analysis of sleep states 
in addition  its physiological sensors are specifically designed for use in the home 
these sensors record a variety of patient data and transmit the information to a base recording station located in the patient s room 
the information is subsequently sent by modem to the sleep laboratory or other clinical setting where it is monitored by a trained clinician 
a single nightwatch system can be expanded economically to conduct sleep studies at multiple locations by adding additional recorders to the central system in order to collect data from several patients simultaneously 
the company estimates that in the us approximately  sleep clinics currently exist at hospitals and other medical centers where pulmonologists  technicians and other medical professionals diagnose osa as well as other sleep disorders and then prescribe the appropriate treatment 
such laboratories provide the most frequent source of patient introductions to the company s sleep products 
the osa patient can purchase the company s osa therapy products from home health care products dealer locations worldwide 
personnel at each of these locations are equipped to train the patient in the product s use and to maintain and service the product see sales  distribution  and marketing 
the retail price for a cpap unit ranges from to  depending on type of unit  geographical market and whether certain accessories are purchased 
the retail price for a bi level osa unit generally ranges from  to  depending on which model is purchased 
the company s sleep diagnostic products are sold through dealers and directly to clinical sites 
the company also provides masks used with cpap and bi level devices  including the contour nasal mask  the gel and gold seal masks  the soft series mask  monarch mini mask  and full face masks 
the company believes that its contour nasal mask was the first mask to adequately seal on a patient s face for air delivery  thereby minimizing patient discomfort and promoting increased patient compliance with prescribed usage 
the monarch mini mask is designed to enhance patient comfort with its small size and unique placement on the patient s face  the gel  gold seal and soft series masks utilize a variety of cushion materials to create a comfortable mask seal around the contours of the face

sales of sleep products and all related accessories and replacement parts accounted for  and of the company s net sales for its fiscal years  and  respectively 
respiratory products the company s respiratory products can be separated into four major subcategories non invasive ventilatory support products  invasive portable volume ventilation products  oxygen concentrators and monitoring devices 
non invasive ventilation products 
the company believes it is the leading manufacturer and marketer of non invasive ventilatory support devices in the us such devices are intended to augment the ventilation of a spontaneously breathing patient  but are not intended to satisfy the total ventilatory requirements of the patient 
the company s principal non invasive ventilatory support products are the bipap ventilatory support system  the initial version of which was introduced in december  and the quantum pressure support ventilator  which was introduced in both products are low pressure  electrically driven flow generators with an electronic pressure control designed to augment patient breathing by supplying pressurized air to the patient 
both products sense the patient s breathing and adjust their output to assist in inhalation and exhalation 
additionally  both products compensate for mask leaks  which often occur in the delivery of ventilatory support to the patient  thereby providing what the company believes is a more efficient and consistent non invasive therapy than competing volume ventilators 
the face masks described in the sleep products section above are also used with the non invasive ventilatory support units 
the company believes that its non invasive ventilatory support products have the potential for increasing patient comfort by adapting to the patient s breathing cycles as opposed to requiring the patient to adapt his breathing to the ventilator cycles and by delivering therapy effectively with a patient mask rather than requiring intubation 
the retail price for the units  which range from  to  also compares favorably to the cost of invasive ventilators  which generally retail for  to  the company also manufactures and markets the hospital bipap ventilatory support system  which includes accessories such as an airway pressure monitor  a detachable control panel  a disposable circuit and a mounting stand  all of which are designed to allow the bipap ventilatory support system to be used more easily in the hospital environment 
the company is supporting clinical trials that are investigating the possible benefits of bipap therapy for different types of patient populations 
applications being studied include use by patients suffering from a variety of respiratory disorders  as well as other in hospital applications 
the marketing of bipap ventilatory support systems for use in these patient populations may require additional clearances from the fda prior to marketing in the us the company s next generation non invasive unit for the hospital market  the bipap vision  is currently being distributed in international markets  with domestic distribution to begin upon receipt of clearance to market from the fda 
the bipap vision features an integrated display screen and an optional oxygen module  provides higher flow and pressure functions than the company s other non invasive units  and is designed to be easily upgradeable when advanced technology becomes available 
international distribution of bipap harmony  the next generation non invasive unit for the homecare market  is expected to begin before the end of fiscal year  with domestic release to follow upon receipt of clearance to market from the fda 
the bipap harmony features simple  menu driven operations and improved portability including ac or dc power capability and is also designed to be easily upgradeable 
the company also is currently working to incorporate proportional assist ventilation pav into its line of bipap ventilatory support products 
pav is a mode of ventilatory support that provides assistance in proportion to the needs of the patient 
the company has conducted extensive clinical studies in europe using pav and has been granted investigational device exemptions by the fda to conduct clinical tests in the us using pav in both non invasive and invasive applications 
application for regulatory clearance to market devices that include pav  which is required prior to the marketing of such products in the us  has not yet been made 
the pav technology was obtained by the company through a non exclusive licensing arrangement with the university of manitoba in winnipeg  canada 
insurance coverage by federal government insurance programs for home use in the united states of non invasive ventilatory support products like the company s bipap ventilatory support system and the quantum pressure support ventilator is currently under review 
during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year  the company s sales of these products for home use in the united states were adversely affected by the uncertainty in the market that this review created and the corresponding reduction in purchases of these units by the company s dealer customers pending resolution of these coverage guidelines 
the company expects that its sales of non invasive ventilatory support units for home use in the united states will continue to be negatively impacted as compared with periods prior to the issuance of the guidelines until final coverage guidelines are issued  or for the foreseeable future if final guidelines are issued that are either as restrictive as  or more restrictive than  the draft guidelines 
see business third party reimbursement for a detailed discussion of this matter 
invasive ventilation products 
the company believes that it is also the leading manufacturer and marketer of invasive portable volume ventilators that are used in the home by individuals who are dependent on the ventilators for continuous life support 
the company s principal invasive portable volume ventilator is the plv  a microprocessor controlled  electrically powered unit specifically designed for long term use in the home and also suitable for transport  short term and institutional use 
the plv can be used to ventilate a wide range of patients 
the small  lightweight unit delivers volume ventilation through the operation of a piston inside the unit  and it can be powered by normal ac power or dc battery power and can be operated in three different ventilation modes depending on the patient s needs 
the unit features a variety of alarms and displays to alert clinicians and caregivers to changes in the patient s pulmonary status or to possible unit malfunction 
the company manufactures and distributes different versions of the plv for international markets based on language differences  and it also manufactures and distributes a variety of accessories for use with the plv the plv unit and related accessories reach end user patients primarily through the company s network of medical product dealers who purchase or rent the unit from the company and resell or rent it to end users 
in certain limited cases  the company rents these units directly to end users 
the company also manufactures  distributes and rents several other home ventilation products  including a version of the plv designed more specifically for institutional use 
oxygen products 
the company s principal oxygen products are oxygen concentrators  which provide a continuous flow of oxygen by separating it from room air with a molecular sieve composed of an inorganic silicate 
oxygen concentrators are generally used in the home by patients who require supplemental oxygen 
supplemental oxygen is prescribed for persons with a variety of chronic pulmonary disorders  such as lung cancer  emphysema  bronchitis or acute pneumonia 
these individuals generally rent an oxygen delivery system from a home medical equipment dealer 
the company believes it is currently one of the leaders in the manufacture and sale of oxygen concentrators in the united states 
the company offers two primary oxygen concentrator products  the alliance series and the recently introduced millenium series  both of which produce a continuous flow of up to oxygen 
both units are designed to be easy to maintain and service and are suitable for chronic patients in the advanced stages of illness and for the less severe respiratory patient 
the company also manufactures and markets oximeter products for use in the home 
the units  which allow patients to take readings of their blood oxygen levels and pulse rate  feature the capability to store up to hours of data 
this data can be later downloaded via the company s software  which prints reports for oximetry analysis 
monitoring products 
the company s primary monitoring products are designed for infants at risk for sudden infant death syndrome or sids 
sids is the sudden unexpected death of an infant which remains unexplained after investigation and is one of the leading causes of death in the united states of infants between one month and one year of age 
despite extensive research  the causes of sids remain unknown 
high risk infants who are prescribed home monitors include infants with low birth weight  those who are premature  those who survive a serious cardiorespiratory episode and those born to a family with a sids incident history 
there is no alternative therapy generally available 
the company s primary infant monitor is the smartmonitor  a fifth generation microprocessor based design that incorporates many aspects of a physiological recorder into the traditional monitor 
in addition to sounding an alarm to alert the parents  the smartmonitor documents patient episodes with an internal electronic memory system  enabling physicians to study up to six channels of patient waveforms in order to assess the medical significance of the alarm episodes and determine the need for continued monitoring or possible hospitalization 
the data collected by the smartmonitor can be transmitted from the home to a clinical center over phone lines or can be extracted from the smartmonitor using a memory transfer device such as a computer or memory module 
the company also manufactures and markets the wallaby ii phototherapy system  a cost effective alternative to conventional overhead phototherapy lights for treating newborn jaundice  a condition which is caused by elevated levels of bilirubin in the blood and which  in severe cases  can result in brain damage 
sales of respiratory products and related accessories and replacement parts accounted for  and of the company s net sales for its fiscal years  and respectively 
asthma  allergy and oem products asthma and allergy products 
the asthma device market is comprised primarily of peak flow meters and drug delivery systems  including spacer devices 
a peak flow meter provides an objective measure of lung function and is used by the patient at home to assist in the management of asthma 
a spacer  when used with a metered dose inhaler mdi  facilitates the delivery of asthma medications 
the company believes that it is currently the national leader in the sale of peak flow meters  with products that include the assess peak flow meter and the portable peak flow meter  personal best 
the company s drug delivery device  optihaler  is consistent with new medical reimbursement guidelines  which give preference to metered dose delivery systems 
the company also markets a spacer product known as optichamber 
in addition  the revised national asthma education and prevention program naepp guidelines issued in march have placed further emphasis on the use of peak flow meters and spacers to ensure effective asthma management 
optichamber represents an important growth area based upon naepp s expanded indications for mdi anti inflammatory therapy  including new recommendations for use with children under five years of age 
the company s asthma products are sold through its subsidiary  respironics healthscan  inc  healthscan located in cedar grove  new jersey 
several distribution channels are used  including specialty hospital dealers 
the company also distributes several models of medication nebulizers  which dispense medication in a fine mist for inhalation deep into the lungs  under the trade name inspiration 
the primary uses for nebulizers have been in the treatment of respiratory diseases  such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis  and conditions such as asthma or allergies 
the company s models utilize a compressor to direct a flow of air through the nebulizer chamber which contains medication in liquid form 
an increase in the number of available respiratory medications in recent years  coupled with the cost and efficacy of aerosol delivery methods  has contributed to the growth of this market 
oem products 
the company provides disposable cushion anesthesia masks primarily for use during surgery 
the company s line of disposable air filled cushion anesthesia masks utilizes a very thin and pliable soft plastic air filled cushion around the nose and mouth  which provides a uniform seal to prevent leakage of the anesthetic gases and helps ensure compliance with anesthesia gas exposure standards imposed on hospitals by regulatory bodies

the company s marketing organization is currently staffed by product managers  who are assigned to each of the company s principal product groups 
the product managers stay abreast of changes in the marketplace  with an emphasis on product use specifications  features  price  promotions  education  training and distribution 
the company s us dealer customer base which ranges in size from large  publicly held dealers with several hundred branch locations to small  owner operated dealers with one location is undergoing significant consolidation  particularly among dealers specializing in home care products 
the impact on the company of this customer consolidation is likely to continue to be reduced selling prices for the company s products as a result of greater purchasing power and market dominance enjoyed by larger customers 
competition the company believes that the principal competitive factors in all of its markets are product and service performance and innovation 
efficient distribution and competitive price are also very important factors 
in the case of a number of the company s and its competitors products  patent protection is becoming more prevalent and of increasing competitive importance 
the company competes on a product by product basis with various other companies  some of which have significantly greater financial and marketing resources and broader product lines 
the company believes that it is the us market leader for osa therapy products  non invasive ventilatory support products  and invasive portable volume ventilation products 
however  other manufacturers  including other larger and more experienced manufacturers of home health care products  are active in these markets and the company expects that competition will increase 
in its major market segments  the company competes with two principal competitors  mallinckrodt  inc mallinckrodt and resmed  inc 
resmed 
mallinckrodt  which is the company s largest major competitor and has the largest financial resources of the company s competitors  offers an array of products which compete with all of the company s products 
resmed competes with the company in the osa and non invasive ventilatory support markets 
the company also competes with invacare corp 
and with divisions of sunrise medical  inc and thermo election corporation in several product lines 
similar to the company s customer base  the medical device manufacturing industry is also undergoing significant consolidation 
several of the company s competitors have announced or completed mergers  such as the acquisition of nellcor puritan bennett by mallinckrodt 
the impact on the company of this competitor consolidation is likely to be greater competition from medical device manufacturers which can utilize the financial and technical resources that may be made available as a result of the consolidation

the company s research and development efforts are focused on understanding the problems faced by cardiopulmonary physicians and their patients needs and on maintaining the company s technological leadership in its core product areas 
the company maintains both formal and informal relationships with physician practitioners and researchers including sleep laboratories to supplement these research and development efforts 
the company s research and development efforts enable it to capitalize on opportunities in the respiratory medical product market by upgrading its current products as well as developing new products 
the company conducts substantially all of its research and development for existing and potential new products in the us the company currently employs approximately engineers and technicians in such activities 
the research and development staff performs overall conceptual design work for all products and the design work related to the manufacturing  engineering and tooling for products manufactured by the company 
the company spent approximately  of net sales in fiscal year   of net sales in fiscal year and  of net sales in fiscal year to support product enhancement and new product development 
new product introductions in all of the company s core product areas took place during fiscal years  and  including the products in the great performers family  the bipap vision hospital ventilatory support system  new versions of the tranquility and quantum units  a new sleep diagnostic product  a new oxygen concentrator  and several new face mask products 
the company expects to release a variety of new devices in its core product areas in fiscal year in some cases  initial distribution has been  and will be  conducted in international markets until regulatory clearance to market in the us is obtained 
see regulatory matters 
in addition to its development efforts in its core product areas  the company is actively pursuing product development activities in new markets  most notably infant care and fetal monitoring 
the company has obtained the north american rights to a patented technology from spectrx  inc for a non invasive method of measuring the level of bilirubin in the blood of infants 
the current method of measuring bilirubin levels to diagnose jaundice in infants  the heel stick  involves drawing blood from the infant and is a painful  costly and time consuming procedure 
the non invasive method for measuring bilirubin has obvious advantages over the heel stick and will allow the detection and diagnosis of jaundice to occur in the entire spectrum of infant care  from hospital to home 
the spectrx device  called the bilicheck  is expected to be launched in canada in the second quarter of fiscal year an application for us regulatory clearance to market has been filed  and the us launch of the bilicheck will begin when this clearance is received 
the company also owns proprietary technology in the area of fetal oximetry monitoring 
the current technology utilized in the united states for determining fetal well being during labor and delivery involves monitoring fetal heart rate 
the company believes that fetal heart rate is reliable as a measure of fetal distress only about of the time  and as a result unnecessary cesarean deliveries are performed  increasing costs and medical legal exposure 
the company s fetal oximetry technology will give clinicians new oxygen data relative to fetal well being and will also provide heart rate data  thereby providing a more complete picture of the fetus s status 
the fetal oximetry product is currently under development and is also undergoing clinical evaluation 
the company also maintains a new ventures group at its facility in plum borough  pennsylvania 
led by a senior vice president of new ventures  this group of employees  which includes engineers  researchers  technicians  and business development experts  is charged with identifying product  technology  and business opportunities outside of the company s core products areas 
patents  trademarks and licenses the company seeks patent protection for certain of its products through the prosecution and acquisition of patents and exclusive licensing arrangements

the company also has registered us and foreign trademarks and has additional us and foreign trademark applications pending 
the company is a party to two legal actions relating to its patents and the patents of its competitors 
see item legal proceedings for more information regarding these actions 
regulatory matters the company s products are subject to regulation by  among other governmental entities  the fda and corresponding foreign agencies 
the fda regulates the introduction  manufacture  advertising  labeling  packaging  marketing and distribution of and recordkeeping for such products 
on june   new fda regulations governing the manufacture of medical devices took effect 
these regulations imposed new requirements on device manufacturers such as design controls 
in manufacturing and marketing its products  the company must comply with fda regulations and is subject to various other fda recordkeeping requirements and to inspections by the fda 
the testing for and preparation of required applications can be expensive  and subsequent fda review can be lengthy and uncertain 
the fda also regulates the clinical testing of medical devices 
moreover  clearance or approval  if granted  can include significant limitations on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed 
failure to comply with applicable fda regulations can result in fines  civil penalties  suspensions or revocation of clearances or approvals  recalls or product seizures  operating restrictions or criminal penalties 
delays in receipt of  or failure to receive  clearances or approvals for the company s products for which such clearances or approvals have not yet been obtained would adversely affect the marketing of such products in the us and could adversely affect the results of future operations 
the company must obtain fda or foreign regulatory approval or clearance for marketing the company s new devices prior to their release 
there are two primary means by which the fda permits a medical device to be marketed 
a manufacturer may seek clearance for the device by filing a k premarket notification with the fda 
to obtain such clearance  the k premarket notification must establish that the device is substantially equivalent to a device that has been legally marketed or was marketed before may  the manufacturer may not place the device into commercial distribution in the us until a substantial equivalence determination notice is issued by the fda 
the fda  however  may determine that the proposed device is not substantially equivalent  or require further information  such as additional test data or clinical data  or require the company to modify its product labeling  before it will make a finding of substantial equivalence 
the process of obtaining fda clearance of a k premarket notification  including testing  preparation of the k premarket notification and subsequent fda review  can take a number of years and require the expenditure of substantial resources 
if a manufacturer cannot establish to the fda s satisfaction that a new device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device  it will have to seek approval to market the device through the premarket approval application pma process 
this process involves preclinical studies and clinical trials 
the process of completing clinical trials  submitting a pma and obtaining fda approval takes a number of years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the fda will approve a pma 
the company s export activities and clinical investigations also are subject to the fda s jurisdiction and enforcement 
foreign regulatory approvals vary widely depending on the country 
the company has received iso certification for its murrysville  marietta and westminster facilities from the international organization of standards  a quality standards organization based in geneva  switzerland 
the company has also received authorization for the same facilities  under the european union s medical device directives  to affix the ce mark to the company s products marketed throughout the world 
the primary component of the certification process was an audit of the facilities quality systems conducted by an independent agency authorized to perform conformity assessments under iso guidelines and the medical device directives 
since receiving its original iso certification  these facilities have undergone periodic update audits by such independent agencies 
third party reimbursement the cost of a significant portion of medical care in the us is funded by government and private insurance programs  such as medicare  medicaid and corporate health insurance programs including health maintenance organizations and managed care organizations 
the company s future results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected by adverse changes made in the reimbursement policies for medical products under these insurance programs 
if such changes were to occur  the ability of the company s customers medical product distributors and dealers to obtain adequate reimbursement for the resale or rental of the company s products could be reduced 
in recent years  limitations imposed on the levels of reimbursement by both government and private insurance programs have become more prevalent 
early in calendar year  government policy makers began a review of the coverage guidelines for home use in the united states of non invasive ventilatory support products like the company s bipap ventilatory support systems and quantum pressure support ventilators 
the majority of end users of these products participate in federal government insurance programs that are impacted by the decisions of hcfa regarding these coverage guidelines 
as part of this review process  the dmerc s  which are the entities that process insurance claims for federal government insurance programs  attended a consensus conference on non invasive ventilation in february this consensus conference was organized and attended by members of the national association for medical direction of respiratory care  an association of clinicians involved in respiratory care 
other attendees included representatives from hcfa  the dmerc s  representatives from major medical and trade associations and equipment manufacturers and distributors 
the conference was intended to develop a consensus regarding appropriate clinical criteria for the use of non invasive ventilation in the home 
during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year  the company s sales of non invasive ventilatory support products for home use in the united states were adversely affected by the uncertainty in the market that this coverage guideline review created and the corresponding reduction in the purchase of these units by the company s dealer customers pending resolution of the coverage guidelines 
in july  the dmerc s issued their draft basic coverage policy for the use of non invasive ventilation in the home 
these draft guidelines as issued were believed by industry observers to be more restrictive than the findings of the consensus conference  particularly with regard to the certifications required of prescribing physicians  the requirement of in hospital testing prior to use and the requirement for a three part evaluation during this in hospital testing 
in addition  the guidelines as drafted appear to contemplate changes in reimbursement classifications in addition to changes in coverage policies 
the company filed formal comments on the dmerc draft guidelines in september as permitted by dmerc and hcfa regulations 
a variety of trade and medical associations  device manufacturers and home care distributors also filed formal comments 
the company  and the other groups filing comments  agreed that while coverage guidelines are needed  the guidelines as drafted are too restrictive  do not reflect the findings of the consensus conference and will in fact increase the total cost of medical care for patients who could benefit from non invasive ventilatory support in the home while at the same time limiting patient access to this type of therapy 
the company estimates that the final coverage policy will be published by the dmerc s in late calendar year or early calendar year after the comments which have been filed have been reviewed and considered 
while the company cannot predict with certainty the provisions of the final coverage policy  it believes that favorable modifications will be made from the draft version that was released in july however  there can be no assurances that the final coverage policy will be favorably modified or that it will not be as or more restrictive than the draft policy 
the company expects that its sales of non invasive ventilatory support units for home use in the united states will continue to be negatively impacted as compared with periods prior to the issuance of the guidelines until the final guidelines are issued  or for the foreseeable future if final guidelines are issued that are either as restrictive as  or more restrictive than  the draft guidelines 
during the quarter ended june   sales of non invasive ventilatory support units for home use in the united states accounted for less than of the company s total sales 
the company has obtained procedure codes for its home care products from hcfa 
these procedure codes enhance the ability of medical product distributors and dealers to obtain reimbursement for providing products to patients covered by medicare 
in addition  many private insurance programs also use the hcfa procedure code system 
however  reimbursement levels can be reduced after a procedure code has been established 
the amount of reimbursement that a hospital can obtain under the medicare diagnosis related group drg payment system for utilizing the company s products in treating patients is a primary determinant of the revenue that can be realized by medical product distributors and dealers who resell or rent the company s hospital products 
many private insurance programs also utilize the medicare drg system 
the various uses of the company s hospital products to treat patients are provided within the drg system 
the levels of reimbursement under the drg system are also subject to review and change 
employees the company currently has  employees  including hourly employees in the us and hourly employees in the far east 
none of the company s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
the company considers its labor relations to be good and has never suffered a work stoppage as a result of a labor conflict

item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition results of operations net sales for fiscal year were  representing a increase in net sales over the  recorded in fiscal year net sales represented a increase over the  recorded in fiscal year increases in sales for the periods presented were due to increases in unit and dollar sales for the company s major product lines and  to a lesser extent  to sales generated by two companies acquired during fiscal year see note k to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these acquisitions 
sales for the second half of fiscal year were adversely impacted by a decrease in sales of the company s non invasive ventilatory support products compared to prior year levels 
these sales decreases were caused by uncertainty in the market concerning insurance coverage guidelines for the home use of these products in the united states and the corresponding reduction in purchases of these units by the company s dealer customers pending resolution of the coverage guidelines 
government policy makers issued a draft coverage policy in july that was more restrictive than had been expected 
the company  along with trade and medical associations  other device manufacturers and home care dealers  have filed formal comments as permitted with the policy makers indicating disagreement with the draft coverage policy 
the company estimates that a final coverage policy will be issued in late calendar year or early calendar year and believes that until these final guidelines are issued  sales of its non invasive ventilatory support units for home use in the united states will continue to be negatively impacted as compared with periods prior to the issuance of the guidelines 
if the final guidelines issued are either as restrictive as  or more restrictive than  the draft guidelines  the company s sales of its non invasive ventilatory support units for home use in the united states will continue to be negatively impacted 
in addition  the company is also experiencing more general challenges in its marketplace due to the january reductions in medicare reimbursement for oxygen therapy  which adversely affected many of the company s dealer customers 
the company s gross profit held constant at of net sales for fiscal years  and  reflecting the fact that decreases in average selling prices for the company s major products which had been expected over the period were offset by manufacturing support costs increasing at rates less than the rate of sales increase  lower product costs and sales mix 
general and administrative expenses were  of net sales for fiscal year as compared to  of net sales for fiscal year and  of net sales for fiscal year the increases in expenses for the periods presented were due primarily to increased information systems costs  legal fees  allowances for doubtful accounts and other administrative expenses 
the increases were also due to costs incurred by the company s respironics colorado  inc respironics colorado and stimotron medizinische gerate gmbh stimotron subsidiaries  since their acquisition in october and february  respectively 
finally  amortization of the goodwill generated by those acquisitions is included in general and administrative expenses starting at the date of acquisition 
these increased expenses for fiscal year were offset by cost reductions that the company obtained since the february closing of the merger with healthdyne 
sales  marketing and commission expenses were  of net sales for fiscal year as compared to  of net sales for fiscal year and  of net sales for fiscal year the increases in expenses for the periods presented were due primarily to increased costs for advertising  trade shows and related marketing communication activities  international sales and marketing activities and sales and marketing management 
the increases were also due to costs incurred by the company s respironics colorado and stimotron subsidiaries since their acquisition 
respironics colorado has a network of fully staffed customer satisfaction centers throughout the us  a portion of the costs of which are included in sales  marketing and commissions 
in addition  because a portion of the company s distribution activities in germany are managed through stimotron  most of stimotron s operating expenses are included in sales  marketing and commissions 
these increased expenses for fiscal year were offset by cost reductions that the company obtained since the february closing of the merger with healthdyne 
research and development expenses were  of net sales for fiscal year as compared to  of net sales for fiscal year and  of net sales for fiscal year the increase in expenses for the periods presented were due to continuing development work on a variety of new products in each of the company s major product lines 
specifically  significant development and clinical work was conducted  and is continuing  on the company s obstructive sleep apnea therapy products and the next generation versions of the company s non invasive ventilation products 
additional development work and clinical trials are being conducted in the company s other primary product areas and in certain product areas outside the company s core products 
during the fiscal year  the company incurred  in costs related to the merger with healthdyne 
the primary components of these costs were direct expenses of the transaction such as legal and investment banking fees  severance and other employment related costs  and asset write downs to reflect decisions made regarding product and operational standardization inventory   other assets  
see note m to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding merger costs 
during fiscal years and  the company also incurred  in costs associated with an unsolicited offer by a third party to acquire healthdyne 
the company s effective income tax rate from operations ie excluding the impact of the merger costs described above was for fiscal year as compared to for fiscal year and for fiscal year changes in the company s effective income tax rate are due primarily to changes in the relative proportions of taxable income attributable to its us and european operations versus taxable income attributable to its hong kong and peoples republic of china operations because the us and european operations pay income taxes at a higher rate approximately before available income tax credits than do the hong kong and peoples republic of china operations 
for the fiscal year to comparison  the proportion of taxable income attributable to the us and european operations increased  due in part to taxable income generated by the company s new subsidiaries  respironics colorado and stimotron  since their acquisitions 
accordingly  since these us operations pay income tax at a higher rate than do the hong kong and peoples republic of china operations the result was an increased effective tax rate for the company s effective income tax rate for fiscal year including the impact of the merger charges was because certain of the direct expenses of the merger transaction  such as investment banking and legal fees  are not deductible for income tax purposes 
as a result of the factors described above  the company s net income loss was  of net sales or 
per diluted share for fiscal year as compared to  of net sales or per diluted share for fiscal year and  of net sales or per diluted share for fiscal year excluding the impact of the merger costs and the costs associated with the unsolicited offer to acquire healthdyne  the company s net income was  of net sales or per diluted share for fiscal year and  of net sales or per diluted share for fiscal year financial condition  liquidity and capital resources the company had working capital of  and  at june  and  respectively 
net cash used by operating activities was  for fiscal year  as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of  and  for fiscal years and  respectively 
the net use of cash by operating activities for the fiscal year as compared to net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year was due primarily to lower earnings including the impact of the cash portion of the merger costs incurred  increases in inventory and accounts receivable and decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities from fiscal year to fiscal year was due primarily to higher earnings  an increase in inventory in fiscal year in an amount smaller than the increase in that account in the prior year and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
net cash used by investing activities was   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
net cash used by investing activities for fiscal year included  relating to the october  acquisition of lifecare international  inc and  relating to the february  acquisition of stimotron 
the majority of the remaining cash used by investing activities for all periods represented capital expenditures  including the purchase of production equipment  computer and telecommunications equipment  and office equipment 
the funding for the investment activities in all periods was provided by positive cash flows from financing activities  accumulated cash and short term investment balances  and for the prior year periods  positive cash flows from operating activities 
see note k to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these acquisitions 
funding for the stimotron acquisition was provided by a  loan received from a commercial bank in february under the terms of a credit agreement 
see notes d and k to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about long term obligations and acquisition financing 
net cash provided by financing activities includes borrowings and repayments under the company s various long term obligations and also includes proceeds of  from a public offering of  shares of common stock completed in april along with proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the company s stock option plans during each of the years presented 
on august   the company s board of directors authorized a stock buy back of up to  shares of the company s outstanding common stock 
as of september   the company has repurchased  shares in open market transactions 
shares that are repurchased are added to treasury shares pending future use and will reduce the number of shares outstanding 
on may   the company finalized a  revolving credit facility with a group of commercial banks 
this credit facility was used to refinance approximately  of the company s long term debt with the remaining balance of the facility available for future borrowing 
the revolving credit facility permits borrowings and repayments until its maturity in may the revolving credit facility is unsecured and contains certain financial covenants with which the company must comply 
the company is currently in compliance with these covenants 
the interest rate on the revolving credit facility is based on a spread over the london interbank borrowing rate libor 
as of june   the resulting interest rate on amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility was approximately 
see note d to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the credit facility 
the company has not provided a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets because it has determined that it is more likely than not that such assets can be realized  at a minimum  through carrybacks to prior years in which taxable income was generated 
the company believes that positive cash flow from operating and financing activities  the availability of additional funds under its new revolving credit facility  and its accumulated cash and short term investments will be sufficient to meet its current and presently anticipated future needs for fiscal year for operating activities  investing activities  and financing activities primarily consisting of payments on long term debt 
year state of readiness 
the company is currently executing an overall year compliance strategy utilizing the services of a year consulting firm 
a program management office is in place consisting of full time staff resources from both the company and the consulting firm to address the four identified primary risk areas core business information systems and technology  issues relative to the company s products  issues relative to third party product and service providers  and issues relative to the company s facilities 
year compliance of the company s core business information systems and technology has been largely addressed with the recent implementation of year compliant enterprise wide resource planning erp software at each of the company s major locations 
one implementation of year compliant software remains to be completed at the company s german distribution subsidiary and is expected to be completed during fiscal year a technical review of the company s current and discontinued product lines addressing year issues has been completed  one non compliance was found and has been corrected 
a strategy for dealing with customer inquiries regarding year compliance of the company s products has been implemented as well 
a review of issues relating to third party product and service providers year compliance  including defining inventory and vendor management processes  planning a third party compliance assessment and identifying potential contingency planning and remediation strategies  is currently in process 
this review is currently scheduled to be completed in october based upon the results of this review  a detail project plan for addressing third party product and supplier issues will be developed and carried out 
the company s current expectation is that issues relating the third party product and suppliers year compliance will be resolved by june a preliminary review of issues relating to the year compliance of the company s facilities infrastructure has been completed and no major problems or significant risks are anticipated based on this preliminary review 
year costs 
total costs for the company s year compliance efforts are currently estimated to be approximately  the majority of these costs relate to the erp system installations and upgrades and have been  and will be  capitalized and charged to expense over the estimated useful life of the associated software and hardware 
the remaining costs have been  and will be charged directly to expense 
additional costs could be incurred if significant remediation activities are required with third party suppliers see below 
risks and contingency plans 
based on the year compliance work conducted to date and described above  the company s most significant risk  and its reasonably likely worst case scenario relative to year compliance  appears to be that upon completion of its review of its third party product and service providers year compliance  it determines that certain of its third party product and service suppliers may not be year compliant 
if such product and service suppliers in fact do not become year compliant in a timely manner and these suppliers cannot provide the company with products and services in a timely and cost effective manner  future operating results could be adversely affected 
the company believes that the vendor management process that is currently being developed will identify these potential risks 
while a formal contingency plan for dealing with third party product and service providers who are not year compliant has not been completed  the company expects to have several options available to deal with identified non compliance 
for product and services where the company s needs are not unique or where a long term relationship with a supplier does not exist  a search for alternative suppliers who are year compliant would be conducted and suppliers changed as needed prior to january  while the company believes that raw materials and components for its products are readily available from a number of suppliers and believes that its service needs are not significantly unique from other companies  it is possible that for some of its suppliers who are identified as being non compliant  certain remediation strategies with the supplier may be employed  at least initially  as an alternative to switching suppliers because of the operational difficulties that switching suppliers could cause 
these remediation strategies include  but are not limited to  increasing purchases from the suppliers in question prior to january  to provide a safety stock if the supplier experiences difficulty and providing the company s year compliance resources to assist the supplier in becoming compliant 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
interest rates the company s primary interest rate risk relates to its long term debt obligations 
at june   the company had total long term obligations  including the current portion of those obligations  of  of that amount   was in fixed rate obligations and  was in variable rate obligations 
assuming a increase in interest rates on the company s variable rate obligations ie  an increase from the june  weighted average interest rate of to a weighted average interest rate of  annual interest expense would be approximately  higher based on the june  outstanding balance of variable rate obligations 
the company has no interest rate swap or exchange agreements 
foreign exchange rates a substantial majority of the company s sales  expenses  and cash flows are transacted in us dollars 
for the year ended june   sales denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily the german mark  and to a lesser extent the french franc and the chinese yuan totaled  or approximately of total sales 
pre tax income denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily the hong kong dollar and the german mark totaled  or approximately of total pre tax income excluding the impact of merger costs and costs related to an unsolicited offer to acquire healthdyne 
an adverse change of in exchange rates would have resulted in a decrease in sales of  and a decrease in net income of  for the year ended june  the company s entities that operate in germany  france  hong kong and china have certain accounts receivable and accounts payable denominated in us dollars in addition to receivable and payable accounts in their home currencies which can act to further mitigate the impact of foreign exchange rate changes 
the company has no significant foreign currency exchange contracts 
inflation inflation has not had a significant effect on the company s business during the periods discussed
