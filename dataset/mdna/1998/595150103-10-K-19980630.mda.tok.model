item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides an analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and the notes thereto and the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto of the company 
forward looking information is subject to risk and uncertainty this discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainty  including management s expectations for fiscal and known trends and uncertainties in the business 
actual future results and trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors  including the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter  the timing and acceptance of new products and product enhancements by the company or its competitors  changes in pricing  product life cycles  seasonality of customer buying patterns  the existence of product errors  extraordinary events  such as litigation or acquisition  including related charges  and economic conditions generally or in various geographic areas 
all of the foregoing factors  and others mentioned elsewhere in this form k  make operating results difficult to forecast 
the company s operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past  and the future operating results of the company may fluctuate as a result of the above and other risk factors detailed in the company s annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended march  and other documents filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission 
due to all of the foregoing factors  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
in prior years  the company s actual financial performance has not always met market expectations 
it is likely that  in some future quarter  the company s financial performance will again fall below market expectations 
overview microware develops  markets and supports real time operating system software and high level language compilers used in consumer electronics  communications  process control and factory automation  scientific research  and government defense applications 
microware s product line is built around the os family of real time operating systems for advanced bit and bit microprocessors 
the company s os product family includes options for programming languages  networking  graphical interfaces and productivity tools 
substantially all of the company s revenues in the last and current fiscal years have been derived from licenses and related services from the os product family 
the company has historically derived revenues from development licenses and run time license royalty fees along with sales of related software productivity tools  maintenance support and custom contract engineering work 
custom contract engineering revenues are typically derived from discrete software engineering projects porting the os operating system along with customized software products to a customer s product 
commonly  license royalty fees follow the completion of these contracts and the successful deployment of the customer s product 
for financial reporting purposes  product revenues primarily consist of software licenses and software development tool products  along with license run time royalty fees earned  including non refundable prepaid royalties 
services revenues principally consist of revenues from custom contract engineering and maintenance support agreements  along with consulting and training activity 
a key element of the company s long term strategy is to develop products which can be embedded into successful  high volume customer products  thereby significantly increasing license run time royalty fees 
any increase in the percentage of revenues attributable to license run time royalties will depend on the company s successful negotiation of license run time royalties and on the successful commercialization by the company s customer of the underlying product 
to date  the company has been negatively impacted by target markets  such as cellular phones  two way paging  personal internet devices and digital and interactive television emerging much slower than anticipated 
in addition  there can be no assurances that the company will be successful when the markets  for which the company products are targeted  emerge 
in july  the company entered into a software license and custom contract engineering agreement with motorola to develop modular software solutions for motorola s personal wireless communication devices 
revenues of approximately  and  resulted from contract engineering services for motorola in fiscal and  respectively 
in addition to up front development fees and future consulting and support activities  the company will receive a royalty for each pager or other wireless product using os sold by motorola or its sub licensees 
no development license fees or run time royalties resulted from this agreement in fiscal or these revenues related to products under development which motorola has not yet begun to distribute 
motorola also acquired an equity position in the company as part of this strategic relationship

international revenues represented  and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company expects international sales to continue to represent a significant portion of its revenues although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period 
in europe and japan  revenues and expenses are primarily denominated in local currencies 
in fiscal and  the us dollar strengthened against many foreign currencies which resulted in relatively lower revenues when translated into us dollars 
the company s operating and pricing strategies take into account changes in exchange rates over time  however  the company s results of operations may be significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  in recent months the currencies of many countries in the asia pacific region have lost significant value against the us dollar 
as a result  revenue in this region could be adversely affected in fiscal this overall general instability in the asian currency and stock markets adversely affects the economic health of the entire region  which could negatively impact customer purchasing patterns

total revenues increased  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal product revenues increased  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal product revenues anticipated for fiscal from certain strategic customers  including motorola  ibm and the company s david licensees  fell significantly below management s expectations due to customer delays in the development and distribution of os based products and other factors 
as a result  product revenue growth remained relatively flat from fiscal to the increase in overall company revenues is primarily attributable to the increase in services revenues 
services revenues increased  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal services revenues increased primarily as a result of the company engaging in the development of new processor ports 
in addition  services revenues increased as a result of the company adapting certain third party software to os for key wireless  internet and david customers 
the proportion of total revenues attributable to international sales decreased  from of total revenues in fiscal to of total revenues in fiscal year this decrease resulted from a proportionate increase in north american sales  the assignment of a services contract from an international subsidiary to the company s north american operations  and from foreign currency exchange movements  primarily in the japanese yen

variability of quarterly operating results the company s revenues and operating results have varied substantially from quarter to quarter and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
the company believes its revenues may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending upon such factors as new product introductions by the company or others  seasonality of customer buying patterns  the company s sales commission plan  renewals of product licenses by customers  product development expenses  changes in company and competitors pricing policies  the timing of significant orders  the mix of products sold  the mix of international versus domestic revenues  currency fluctuations  the existence of product errors and the hiring and training of additional staff 
furthermore  delays in closing product licensing transactions or in completion of custom contract engineering work during any quarter could cause quarterly revenues and net earnings for that quarter to fall below anticipated levels 
the company derives a significant portion of its revenues from a relatively small number of large account customers  therefore any delay in the consummation of business with this small number of customers could significantly impact the company s quarterly performance 
the majority of the company s revenues in a quarter has been historically derived from orders received in the last month of that quarter  which makes the company s financial performance more susceptible to an unexpected downturn in business and makes quarterly results difficult to forecast 
in addition  the company s expense levels are based on present expectations of future revenues levels  and a shortfall in revenues could result in a disproportionate decrease in the company s net earnings 
as the markets n which the company competes mature and as new and existing companies compete for customers  price competition is likely to intensify and such competition could adversely affect quarterly operating results 
variations in product mix may also affect gross profit margin percentages 
therefore  although the company s revenues and gross profit in any period may increase in absolute terms  such an increase may result in lower gross profit margin percentages 
liquidity and capital resources the company has historically funded its operations primarily through cash flow from operations  the sale of common and preferred stock and  to a lesser extent  long term debt 
at march   the company had approximately  in working capital and  in cash and short term investments as compared to  in working capital and  in cash and short term investments at march  the decrease in working capital and cash and short term investments resulted principally from the use of cash during fiscal for operating activities 
cash provided by used in operating activities amounted to   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the  difference in cash provided by used in operating activities in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to a change in net earnings loss of  an increase in trade receivables of  and net changes in other reconciling of  the cash used in operations in fiscal primarily resulted from the net loss of  additionally significant uses of cash resulted from an increase in other assets including purchased software of  and a decrease in accounts payable of  these uses of cash in fiscal were partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of  and other reconciling items of  cash provided by used in investing activities was   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the uses of cash in fiscal were related primarily to the purchase of computer and research equipment and furniture and fixtures 
in fiscal  uses of cash resulted from approximately  of cash being used to purchase land and construct the company s new corporate headquarters facility 
in addition  an approximate net  of cash was used to purchase of short term investments and  was used to purchase the equity investment in unwired planet inc in fiscal  cash provided by financing activities resulted principally due to proceeds from the sale of the company s equity investment in unwired planet inc  and the company s former headquarters facility of  and  respectively  offset principally by capital expenditures 
cash provided by used in financing activities was   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the cash from financing activities in fiscal was primarily due to the issuance of  of common stock 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the cash from financing activities in fiscal resulted primarily from the issuance of approximately  in common stock in connection with the company s initial public offering and proceeds of approximately  on the company s construction loan on its new head quarters facility 
in fiscal  cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from the payoff of the company s construction note  partially offset by proceeds received on the company s new long term promissory note and the issuance of common stock resulting from stock options exercised 
as of march   the company had approximately  of long term debt  including current portion  outstanding relating to its headquarters building 
monthly payments are  including interest at  with the unpaid balance due january  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
management believes current working capital and its million bank line of credit will be adequate to meet the company s future working capital  new product development and capital expenditure requirements at least through the end of fiscal management does not believe that inflation has historically had a material effect on the company s results of operations 
many of the company s international contracts are denominated in local currencies  and an increase in the relative value of the dollar against such currencies would lead to a reduction in company revenues 
the company attempts to minimize its foreign currency exposure by attempting to keep intercompany balances current and minimizing assets in any one currency denomination 
however  due to recent losses  intercompany balances have increased and are not specifically hedged and there can be no assurance that the company s future results of operations will not be adversely affected by currency fluctuations 
the company anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of net sales in the foreseeable future 
as a result  the company will be subject to certain risks  including tariffs and other barriers  difficulty in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations  difficulty in managing distributors and resellers  adverse tax consequences and difficulty in accounts receivable collection 
the company is also subject to the risks associated with the imposition of protective legislation and regulations  including those relating to import or export or otherwise resulting from trade or foreign policy 
the company cannot predict whether quotas  duties  taxes or other charges or restrictions will be implemented by the united states or any other country upon the import or export of the company s products in the future 
there can be no assurance that any of these factors or the adoption of restrictive policies will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
reporting comprehensive income 
sfas no 
establishes standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive income and its components in financial statements 
comprehensive income  as defined  includes all changes in equity net assets during a period from non owner sources 
examples of items to be included in comprehensive income  which are excluded from net income  include foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains losses on available for sale securities 
the disclosure prescribed by sfas no 
must be made beginning with the first quarter of fiscal additionally in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information 
this statement establishes standards for the way companies report information about operating segments in annual financial statements 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
the company has not yet determined the impact  if any  of adopting this new standard 
the disclosures prescribed by sfas no 
will be effective for the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ending march  in april  the aicpa issued sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop provides guidance for determining whether computer software is internal use software and on accounting for the proceeds of computer software originally developed or obtained for internal use and then subsequently sold to the public 
it also provides guidance on capitalization of the losses incurred for computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
the company has not yet determined the impact  if any  of adopting this statement 
the disclosures prescribed by sop will be effective for the year ending march  consolidated financial statements 
in october and march  the aicpa issued sop  software revenue recognition and sop  deferral of the effective date of a provision of sop  software revenue recognition which the company is required to adopt for transactions entered into in the fiscal year beginning april  sop and sop provide guidance on recognizing revenue on software transactions and supercede sop the company believes that the adoption of sop and sop will not have a significant impact on its current licensing or revenue recognition practices 
however  should the company adopt new or change its existing licensing practices  the company s revenue recognition practices may be subject to change to comply with the accounting guidance provided in sop and year issues the company is aware of the numerous issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the year approaches 
the year problem is pervasive and complex  as many computer systems will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to systems that do not properly recognize such information may generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
the year issue creates risk for the company from unforeseen problems in its own computer systems and from third parties with whom the company deals worldwide 
failures in the company s and or third party s computer systems could have a material adverse impact on the company s operations 
to address this concern  the company has evaluated its products to assess their year compliance 
the company believes that the most current release of all of its products will not cease to perform nor generate incorrect or ambiguous data or results solely due to a change in date to or after january  the company believes that the current versions of its products are in material compliance with the year papers by the british standards institute 
while copies of old versions of the company s software may be embedded in deployed products developed by oem licensees  some of which may be used in mission critical functions  the company has made commercially available year fixes to all of its past licensees  and believes that the term of its license agreements preclude any liability for year related failures in such products 
the company is also currently in the process of evaluating its infrastructure along with its external suppliers for year compliance 
management believes its internal infrastructure and external suppliers used will be compliant by the year management does not believe the costs related to achieving year compliance will be material 
there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which the company relies have been or will be accurately converted to be year compliant and will not have an adverse effect on the company s operations
