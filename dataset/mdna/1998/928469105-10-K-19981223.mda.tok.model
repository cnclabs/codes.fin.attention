the company s liquidity could be adversely impacted and its need for capital could materially change if costs are higher than anticipated  the company were to undertake acquisitions demanding significant capital  operating results differ significantly from recent experience or adverse events affect the company s operations 
year compliance the year problem is the result of computer programs written with two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
a computer program written in that manner would recognize the entry of in a date field as referring to the year and not the year an error of this type could result in various types of miscalculations  systems failures and business process interruption 
this issue is not unique to the company and is sometimes known as yk  year or the millennium bug collectively  yk issues 
the company has examined its products and systems to assess and minimize what problems may be encountered with regard to the yk issues and the company s ability to transact business without interruption 
the company s primary focus on yk issues is to assure the ability to continue to provide safe and effective products to its customers and end users 
a technical review of the company s product lines addressing yk issues has been completed 
none of the company s single use products are affected by yk issues because their components do not include any form of microprocessor or clock 
the company has also inquired of its major suppliers of raw materials to obtain their assurances that key raw materials sold to the company will not be impacted by yk issues 
there can be no assurance  however  that there will not be any interruption in supply of any raw materials 
in order to determine the potential impact of yk issues on the company s products  the company has inquired of its suppliers or subcontractors  as appropriate  to obtain an understanding that products will not be affected by yk issues 
the company has not as yet developed a formal contingency plan for addressing problems resulting from vendors and suppliers of goods and services who are not year compliant 
however  based upon the company s yk issues compliance investigations  the company believes that as to most of the raw materials  supplies and services used in its business  alternative means of supply would be available to the extent a supplier or vendor was unable to continue to provide such materials  supplies or services due to yk issues 
notwithstanding the foregoing  if the supply of face masks from respironics  inc were interrupted as a result of yk issues including  without limitation  yk issues relating to common carriers in transporting face masks from the place of manufacture in china  no assurance can be given that the company could maintain the required supply of face masks in the quantity and at a cost that would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  including sale of compatible products 
the company will continue its communication with its suppliers including respironics to address adverse consequence of yk issues 
however  no assurance can be given and the company s policy is to maintain a sufficient inventory of face masks to lessen the impact of temporary interruptions 
the company began a process of upgrading its computer software approximately two years ago 
while this effort was not undertaken in order to address yk issues  the need to upgrade the software occurred contemporaneously with an increased awareness of yk issues 
the hardware and software components purchased or licensed by the company in connection with the upgrade of the computer software were analyzed for yk issues compliance 
the company believes that when the new software is fully installed and operational  all material computer systems will be yk compliant 
certain components of the system have already been installed and are operating generally as anticipated 
the company anticipates that the software upgrade will be fully operational during the second quarter of calendar year because the upgrade of the computer software was to address increases in volume  number of users and unsupported software  the company has not ascribed any of these computer costs to yk issues compliance  but as capital expenditures made in the ordinary course of business 
several of the company s in house manufacturing lines used to manufacture raw materials into component parts are controlled by equipment incorporating microprocessors 
the company also has certain other operating equipment which incorporate microprocessors 
the company has made inquiry of manufacturers and providers of certain key equipment and device contract companies and is upgrading certain equipment 
the company believes that the costs to upgrade such equipment are not expected to be material to the company and that such other equipment material to the company s operations will not be materially affected by yk issues 
the estimates and conclusions herein with respect to yk issues are forward looking statements under the reform act and are based on management s best estimates of future events 
actual results could differ materially from the company s estimates and conclusions as a result of a number of factors incluidng the availability of resources  the ability to discover and correct the potential yk sensitive issues which could have a serious impact on certain operations and the ability of the company s vendors  suppliers  providers of goods and services and customers to bring their systems into yk issues compliance 
recent accounting pronouncements the company adopted the financial accounting standards board statement no 
earning per share  beginning with the quarter ended december  earnings per share data for all prior years have been restated to conform to the provisions of this statement

historically  the international portion of the company s sales has been relatively small and the effect of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on the company s earnings generally has been small relative to other factors that also affect earnings  such as unit sales and operating margins
