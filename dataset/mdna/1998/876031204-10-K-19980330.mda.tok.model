item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the results of operations of napro biotherapeutics  inc together with its subsidiaries  napro 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 
special note certain statements set forth below constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the reform act 
see special note regarding forward looking statements 
general napro is a natural product pharmaceutical company which is focusing primarily on the development  manufacture and commercialization of paclitaxel  a naturally occurring anti cancer agent found in certain species of yew taxus trees 
napro s paclitaxel is referred to herein as nbt paclitaxel 
napro has devoted its efforts primarily to the development and implementation of its propriety extraction  isolation and purification eip tm technology for producing nbt paclitaxel 
to advance the development and commercialization of nbt paclitaxel  napro entered into year  exclusive agreements with each of fh faulding co  ltd 
faulding and ivax corporation including its subsidiaries  ivax for the clinical development  sales  marketing and distribution of nbt paclitaxel 
napro and ivax entered into an agreement on march  the termination agreement terminating their development and marketing relationship  and napro is actively seeking one or more partners to replace ivax 
napro is currently dependent for revenue exclusively on sales of nbt paclitaxel  on royalties from licenced technology and amounts due under the termination agreement 
through december   napro s production of nbt paclitaxel was limited primarily to research and pilot scale production  and much of napro s product sales were for use in clinical trials and for research and development purposes 
accordingly  napro has generated only limited revenue from such activities and has incurred significant operating losses  including operating losses of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  resulting in an accumulated deficit of million as of december  napro expects that it will continue to have a high level of operating expense and will be required to make significant up front expenditures in connection with its biomass procurement  product development and research and development activities 
napro anticipates that operating losses will continue until such time  if ever  as napro is able to generate sufficient revenue to support its operations 
napro believes that its ability to generate such revenue depends primarily on the ability to obtain regulatory approval in the us or another major market for the commercial sale of nbt paclitaxel  on napro s ability to obtain regulatory approval for its manufacturing facilities and on napro s ability to construct manufacturing facilities that produce quantities of nbt paclitaxel sufficient to supply napro s strategic partners requirements for commercial sales 
in january  faulding received approval to market nbt paclitaxel commercially in australia under the trade name anzatax tm 
the ability of faulding to continue to market nbt paclitaxel in australia pursuant to faulding s marketing approval and the success of these marketing efforts will continue to have a significant effect on napro s revenue and profitability 
in february  bristol myers squibb company bms submitted a supplemental new drug application with orphan drug designation for paclitaxel for the treatment of kaposi s sarcoma ks ahead of the filing by ivax of a new drug application nda for the same indication 
the bms application was approved by the food and drug administration fda in august under the orphan drug act of  this approval resulted in ivax napro being denied marketing approval for the ks indication for seven years 
in february  due to the delay in receiving marketing approval for paclitaxel  napro underwent a restructuring to decrease overall costs 
napro s total number of employees will be reduced to  resulting in a reduction in full time positions and an estimated annual savings of million in payroll expense 
this decrease in payroll expense will be reflected in general and administrative  as well as research and development expense 
in addition  non payroll expenses are also expected to decrease as the result of the restructuring 
as part of this restructuring  the company discontinued operations at its british columbia manufacturing facility 
this restructuring is expected to produce annualized savings in personnel costs of about million 
as part of the restructuring  napro temporarily closed its british columbia manufacturing facility and suspended construction of its commercial scale manufacturing facility in boulder  colorado 
completion of the boulder facility will require additional financing  which the company intends to seek at such time as napro foresees sufficient product demand to warrant completion of the facility 
in march  napro and ivax entered into the termination agreement 
termination of the ivax agreement leaves napro free to seek regulatory approvals and market nbt paclitaxel itself or to seek a new partner or partners with which to pursue regulatory approvals and marketing of nbt paclitaxel  in either such case in areas outside the faulding territory 
however  the termination of the ivax agreement currently leaves napro without such a partner  and there can be no assurance that napro will be able to secure such approvals or form new long term relationships for the approval  marketing  and distribution of nbt paclitaxel in these areas  or that napro or such a partner  if found  will be able to effectively market nbt paclitaxel 
napro s future growth and profitability will depend on the success of napro s strategic partners in fostering acceptance in the oncology market for nbt paclitaxel as a preferred form of chemotherapy to be used alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
there were no sales to affiliate for such sales for were  sales to affiliate were to ivax  which was not an affiliate in sales to ivax for were million and are included in other sales 
sales to ivax are expected to increase substantially in  however  as a result of the termination agreement  such sales are expected to end soon thereafter 
future product sales in territory outside that covered by napro s agreement with faulding the faulding agreement may be dependant upon the ability of napro to secure new agreements supporting the development and marketing of nbt paclitaxel within that territory 
sales other than to ivax for were million  representing a decrease of million from total sales for were million  up  from the increase was due primarily to the timing of product shipments and to inventory fluctuations of napro s strategic partners 
shipments to napro s strategic partners may vary significantly depending on a number of factors  including the timing and size of any clinical trials  the level of inventory carried and changes in approved markets 
this variability will continue until stable commercial demand has been established for the product in one of napro s principal markets 
research  development and cost of products sold 
research and development expense and cost of products sold for was million  representing an increase of million from the increase resulted primarily from expansion of napro s development and research operations in anticipation of possible approval of the nda filed by ivax with the fda 
napro s production process is not distinct from its research and development processes 
accordingly  the cost of products sold is included with napro s research and development expense 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense for was million  an increase of million from the increase is attributable primarily to increases of million in administrative and support staff   in legal costs   of occupancy costs  and  in consulting and outside service expense 
interest income 
interest income for was  a decrease of  from the decrease is attributable to smaller free cash balances available for investment 
see liquidity and capital resources 
interest and other expense 
interest and other expense for was million  representing an increase of million from approximately million of the expense related to the amortization of original issue discount  a non recurring charge  on the senior convertible debt 
the remainder of the increase is attributable to interest on the senior convertible debt and increased borrowing on equipment financing 
see liquidity and capital resources 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
sales to affiliate increased  to  for sales to affiliate were to ivax 
other sales increased  to million for from million for total revenue increased  to million for from million for through december   the majority of product sales had been for use in clinical trials and for research and development purposes 
research  development and cost of products sold 
research  development and cost of products sold increased million to million for from million for the increase was due primarily to an increase in the level of process development and research  including higher production cost due to higher production volume 
this was offset by plantation fees which decreased from  in to zero  reflecting the completion of research related to plantation development as of december  in  napro began capitalizing plantation expenditures incurred prior to the first commercial harvest and depletes such cost over the remaining life of the plantation contract using the units of production method 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased million to million for from million for this increase was due primarily to an increase in facility cost and an increase in administrative and support staff 
interest income 
interest income increased  to  for from  for this increase was the result of larger free cash balances associated with the completion of napro s offering of common stock in august and its warrant call completed in june see liquidity and capital resources 
interest and other expense 
interest and other expense increased  to  for from  for the increase was attributable to interest on increased borrowings on the equipment lease line and note payable to faulding 
see liquidity and capital resources 
liquidity and capital resources napro s capital requirements have been and will continue to be significant 
as of december   napro had a negative working capital balance of million 
this compared to a working capital balance of million as of december   and reflects the classification as a current liability of million of napro s senior convertible notes the senior notes  which are due in but redeemable by the holders during under certain conditions 
to date  the funding of napro s capital requirements has been dependent primarily on the net proceeds of public offerings of its common stock of approximately million  on private placements of its equity securities of approximately million  on the exercise of warrants and options of million  on net borrowings of million  and on loans and advances from its stockholders and strategic partners 
napro raised approximately million in through the sale of convertible securities 
the net proceeds from the sale of these securities  combined with licensing fees associated with the termination agreement ranging from to million are expected to provide adequate capital to fund its operations and capital expenditures 
pharmaceutical development is  however  a costly and time consuming process 
napro is actively pursuing partners to assist in the development and marketing of its products  and may seek other forms of long term financing should such financing become available on acceptable terms 
in june  napro privately placed million of the senior notes 
the senior notes mature in june and bear an interest rate of 
the interest on the senior notes is payable either in cash  or in napro common stock  at napro s option 
the senior notes are convertible into common stock at discounts ranging from to from the market price of the common stock during specified periods prior to the conversion 
if not converted  upon maturity  the senior notes will be exchanged for year debentures 
the net proceeds of the senior notes totaled million after the placement agent s fees and other offering cost 
under the original terms of the senior notes  the holders of the senior notes are entitled to require partial redemption of the notes in certain circumstances  including significant declines in the market value of napro common stock 
in january napro redeemed  in principal of the senior notes and paid  premium and interest in connection with such a redemption 
in december  napro closed a private placement of  shares of series c senior convertible preferred stock the series c preferred for an aggregate issuance price of million 
the series c preferred accrues dividends at per year payable in common stock or cash at napro s option 
the series c preferred is convertible into common stock at a discount from the average of the lowest closing trade prices to occur during the trading days immediately preceding the conversion date 
under certain circumstances the investor can cause napro to redeem a portion of the series c preferred 
at december  napro may force the conversion of any remaining shares at the conversion price in effect as of december  in january  napro entered into amendments the amendments with the holder of the series c preferred and the holders of the senior notes the investors 
the parties agreed to  over the period through december  i limit the number of shares which could be converted in the event the stock price is below per share to no more than  shares per month and ii suspend the ability of the investors to force napro to redeem any portion of the securities for cash 
in the event there is an unconverted amount of securities outstanding on january   such amount will be convertible in accordance with the original terms of the agreements 
the amendments require napro to propose for approval by its stockholders  at a meeting to be held no later than june   an amendment to its certificate of incorporation that would increase its authorized number of shares of common stock and a proposal to permit the issuance of common stock in excess of of the common stock outstanding at the dates of original issuance of the series c preferred and the senior notes upon conversion of the series c preferred and the senior notes  respectively 
if stockholder approval for those matters is not obtained  the amendments will terminate and in certain circumstances the holders of the series c preferred and the senior notes would have the right to require napro to redeem any inconvertible portion of the series c preferred and the senior notes  respectively 
napro intends to seek the stockholder approvals required by the amendment 
while there can be no assurance that such approvals will be obtained  napro believes it to be in the interest of stockholders that such approvals be given 
in march  napro and ivax entered into the termination agreement  which terminated their development and marketing relationship 
ivax paid napro approximately million pursuant to the termination agreement  and ivax received a royalty free limited  non exclusive license for one of napro s pending patents the pending patent in the united states  europe and certain other markets 
another million in additional payments is to be paid to napro contingent upon the issuance of the pending patent in various countries 
while there can be no assurance these issuance will occur  napro believes it is highly probable that they will do so 
in addition  ivax will transfer to napro within days of napro filing its annual report on form k   shares of napro common stock currently owned by ivax 
napro is actively pursuing another strategic partner  or partners  to assist in the regulatory approval and marketing of nbt paclitaxel in the us and other areas not covered by the faulding agreement 
working capital and cash flow cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million at december  net cash provided by financing activity and from the net proceeds from investments was partially offset by million used in operating activities and by capital expenditures of million 
inventory increased million to million in the year ended december  from million at december  the amount of product held as finished goods equivalents in work in progress inventories as well as finished goods inventories is dependent on a number of factors  including the shipping requirements of napro s strategic partners and napro s production planning for meeting those needs 
inventory balances may vary significantly during product development and launch periods 
napro made significant investments in biomass and work in process in anticipation of the commencement of commercial production if the dna filed with the fda had been approved 
capital expenditures napro expended million during for capital projects 
these expenditures primarily included plantation cost  work on a new large scale commercial eip tm manufacturing facility in boulder  and expansion and improvement to napro s boulder laboratories and facilities 
due to the fda s determination that nbt paclitaxel could not be marketed in the us during bms s period of exclusivity under the orphan drug act  napro has significantly reduced the scope of its operations and has reduced or delay capital expenditures 
napro is seeking a new strategic partner or partners to replace ivax 
the nature of napro s relationship with its strategic partners may change significantly its planned capital expenditures 
the amount and timing of future capital expenditures will depend upon numerous factors  including the progress of napro s research and development programs  the magnitude and scope of these activities  the cost of preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and marketing developments  changes in or terminations of existing strategic relationships  the establishment of additional strategic relationships and the cost of manufacturing scale up 
napro may seek additional long term financing to fund capital expenditures should such financing become available on terms acceptable to napro 
net operating loss carryforwards as of december   napro had net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes of approximately million to offset future taxable income 
under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards is limited after an ownership change  as defined in such section  to an annual amount equal to the value of the loss corporation s outstanding stock immediately before the date of the ownership change multiplied by the federal long term tax exempt rate in effect during the month the ownership change occurred 
such an ownership change occurred in september as a result  napro will be subject to an annual limitation on the use of its net operating losses 
this limitation only affects net operating losses incurred up to the ownership change and does not reduce the total amount of net operating loss which may be taken  but rather limits the amount which may be used during a particular year 
therefore  in the event napro achieves profitability  such limitation would have the effect of increasing napro s tax liability and reducing the net income and available cash resources of napro if the taxable income during a year exceeded the allowable loss carried forward to that year 
year napro has determined that there no material year issues with its own management information system and that is unlikely there will be any issues with its vendors that would have a material effect upon it
