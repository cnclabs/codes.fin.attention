worldwide tire unit sales in were higher than and higher than unit sales of other automotive and industrial rubber products were higher in both and tire unit sales in rose on increased replacement volume in all regions and higher original equipment volume in north america  europe and latin america 
in  tire unit sales rose on higher volume in europe and asia  although original equipment volume decreased in north america and latin america 
revenues in were favorably impacted by higher tire unit sales and the acquisition of manufacturing and distribution operations in south africa  but decreased due primarily to continued worldwide competitive pricing pressures and the adverse effect of currency translations on international results

interest rate management the company actively manages its fixed and floating rate debt mix  within defined limitations  using refinancings and unleveraged interest rate swaps 
the company enters into fixed and floating interest rate swaps to alter its exposure to the impact of changing interest rates on consolidated results of operations and future cash outflows for interest
