liquidity over the next year will be determined by a net cash flow from operations  b capital expenditures including the possible replacement of the company s mis system  c payments on outstanding debt  d receipt of payment on million note due january  relating to the sale of its santa barbara property 
given the number of factors  some of which cannot be foreseen  which can influence this expectation  actual results may differ materially from those expected 
at june   the company had million of debt and equipment lease financings  million of which was classified as short term  and million of which was classified as long term 
the company had million of bank debt and equipment lease financings at june  the credit facilities with the company s bank consist of the following an million term loan term loan available on an approval basis  of which million was drawn down at june   a million revolving line of credit revolving credit  of which million was used at june   and a thousand debt as of june  arising from the equipment financing equipment lease arranged with the bank s equipment leasing subsidiary 
the term loan is due on september   and bears interest at the bank s floating prime rate  currently per annum 
the revolving credit is due on january   and  if the company is not in default  is automatically renewable for one year renewal terms unless the bank  at its option  delivers written notice of non renewal to the company at least months prior to the end of the initial term or any renewal term 
no notice of non renewal was received by october   and  thus  the revolving credit is currently repayable on january  the revolving credit has typically been renewed in the past  and the company anticipates that it will continue to be renewed  although there is no guarantee of renewal 
the revolving credit bears interest at the bank s floating prime rate  currently per annum 
the term loan and revolving credit facilities are collateralized by the company s working capital and equipment 
the equipment lease was originally for a term of months which commenced in june and bears interest at 
it is now expected to be paid in full by the end of fiscal  under the revised payment schedule

on february  and may   the loan agreement was again amended as of december  and march   respectively  to bring the company into compliance with the covenants thereunder 
at june   the company was in compliance with its covenants under this agreement 
the chairman of the board of the bank providing the credit under the loan agreement and equipment lease is a member of the board of directors of the company 
the company believes that the terms of its credit agreements with the bank are substantially similar to those that could have been obtained from an unaffiliated third party 
outlook with the discontinuation of the telecommunications and advanced products divisions  the company is now focused on its information technology and professional services business 
this business has been and is expected to remain profitable with positive operating cash flows 
with the positive free cash flow expected from the services business and with the potential to raise additional equity from the company s equity line agreement  the company expects  over time  to reduce substantially the outstanding principal amount of its bank debt 
risk factors the company and its shareholders face a number of risks  including  but not limited to the following the company s ability to sufficiently grow its services business to generate the needed positive free cash flow to support the debt service described above 
the company s ability to manage within amounts accrued for  and to fund residual net cash expenditures required by  its discontinued operations 
the company s ability to keep and attract the personnel required to service its current and future contract portfolio 
a dependence upon government contracting in general  and particularly a high concentration of the company s business with the us department of defense and its instrumentalities 
the high degree of financial leverage under which the company will continue to operate until its current debt levels are reduced and its equity levels increased 
the risk that the equity line agreement will not remain available  either because the investor does not make required purchases due to any future securities registration problems  or otherwise 
the risk that the company will not be sufficiently prepared for the so called yk problem  and or that the company may incur yk related liabilities see the next section 
year issue the year yk problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
thus the year is represented by the number in many legacy software applications 
consequently  on january   the year will jump back to in accordance with many non yk compliant applications 
to systems that are non yk compliant  the time will seem to have reverted back years 
so  when computing basic lengths of time  the company s computer programs  certain building infrastructure components including  elevators  alarm systems  telephone networks  sprinkler systems  security access systems and certain hvac systems and any additional time sensitive software that are non yk compliant may recognize a date using as the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations which could cause personal injury  property damage  disruption of operations  and or delays in payments from the company s customers  any or all of which could materially adversely effect the company s business  financial condition  or results of operations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company implemented an internal yk compliance task force 
the goal of the task force is to minimize the disruptions to the company s business which could result from the yk problem  and to minimize other liabilities which the company might incur in connection with the yk problem 
the task force consists of existing employees of the company  and no new employees have been hired specifically to address the company s internal yk issues 
the company is in the process of conducting a company wide assessment of its computer systems and operations infrastructure  including systems being developed to improve business functionality  to identify computer hardware  software  and process control systems that are not yk compliant 
the company presently believes that its business critical computer systems which are not presently yk compliant will have been replaced  upgraded or modified in the normal replacement cycle prior to the company s financial accounting software system is an old system which was built in the early s on a commercial database platform by company employees 
the company has modified this system to be yk compliant  but its yk compliance has not been tested by any independent party 
the company presently intends to have this system independently tested in the quarter ending december  if significant deficiencies are found  the company may have to expend significant resources to correct them  or in an extreme case  the company may have to purchase and implement a new system on an accelerated basis 
either of those outcomes would be likely to have a material adverse affect on the company s operating results and financial position 
the company has also initiated communications with third parties whose computer systems functionality could impact grci 
these communications will facilitate coordination of yk solutions and will permit grci to determine the extent to which the company may be vulnerable to failures of third parties to address their own yk issues 
however  as to the systems of the third parties that are linked to grci  in particular those of the us government  there can be no guarantee that such systems that are not now yk compliant will be timely converted to yk compliance 
the company is also assessing any potential yk related exposure it may have with respect to software or hardware it has delivered to its customers 
the costs of the company s yk compliance efforts are being funded with cash flows from operations 
as normal business costs  these costs are generally reimbursible by the government under the company s government contracts under present regulations 
in total  these costs are not expected to be substantially different from the normal  recurring costs that are incurred for systems development  implementation and maintenance 
as a result  these costs are not expected to have a material adverse effect on grci s overall results of operations or cash flows 
additionally  there can be no guarantee that third parties of business importance to grci  in particular the us government  will successfully and timely reprogram or replace  and test  all of their own computer hardware  software and process control systems 
because the majority of the company s business is contracted with the us government  the failure of the us government to achieve yk compliance by the year would have a significant adverse effect on grci s business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
furthermore  if the company s government customers delay other work in order to accelerate their own yk compliance efforts  it could have a significant adverse effect on grci s business  financial position and results of operations 
the company does not yet have a comprehensive contingency plan with respect to the yk problem  but intends to establish such a plan during calendar as part of its ongoing yk compliance effort 
the foregoing assessment of the impact of the yk problem on grci is based on management s best estimates at the present time  and could change substantially 
the assessment is based upon numerous assumptions as to future events 
there can be no guarantee that these estimates will prove accurate  and actual results could differ from those estimated if these assumptions prove inaccurate
