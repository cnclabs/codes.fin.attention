item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general background and performance measurement the company believes that the most significant measures of its operating performance are funds from operations and ebitda 
funds from operations is defined as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of real property  plus depreciation and amortization excluding depreciation on personal property and amortization of loan and financial instrument costs  and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities 
adjustments for unconsolidated entities are calculated on the same basis 
funds from operations does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs 
ebitda represents earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization  minority interest  income in unconsolidated entities  extraordinary items and gain loss on sale of assets 
this data is relevant to an understanding of the economics of the shopping center business as it indicates cash flow available from operations to service debt and satisfy certain fixed obligations 
ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of the company s operating performance  or to cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap or as a measure of liquidity 
while the performance of individual centers and the management companies determines ebitda  the company s capital structure also influences funds from operations 
the most important component in determining ebitda and funds from operations is center revenues 
center revenues consist primarily of minimum rents  percentage rents and tenant expense recoveries 
minimum rents will increase to the extent that new leases are signed at market rents that are higher than prior rents 
minimum rent will also fluctuate up or down with changes in the occupancy level 
additionally  to the extent that new leases are signed with more favorable expense recovery terms  expense recoveries will increase 
percentage rents generally increase or decrease with changes in tenant sales 
as leases roll over  however  a portion of historical percentage rent is often converted to minimum rent 
it is therefore common for percentage rents to decrease as minimum rents increase 
accordingly  in discussing financial performance  the company combines minimum and percentage rents in order to better measure revenue growth 
the following discussion is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of the company for the years ended december   and the following discussion compares the activity for the year ended december  to results of operations for also included is a comparison of the activities for the year ended december  to the results for the year ended december  this information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto

many of the variations in the results of operations  discussed below  occurred due to the addition of these properties to the portfolio during and many factors  such as the availability and cost of capital  overall debt to market capitalization level  interest rates and availability of potential acquisition targets that meet the company s criteria  impact the company s ability to acquire additional properties

the long term closure of these or other stores could adversely affect the company s performance

the company does not believe it will have any significant accounting or operations impact as a result of the year funds from operations the company believes that the most significant measure of its performance is funds from operations ffo

adjustments for unconsolidated entities will be calculated on the same basis

the following reconciles net income to ffo shares amount shares amount amounts in thousands net income   adjustments to reconcile net income to ffo minority interest   depreciation and amortization on wholly owned properties   pro rata share of unconsolidated entities depreciation and amortization   extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt gain on sale of assets from wholly owned centers  pro rata share of gain loss on sale of joint venture assets  amortization of loan costs  including interest rate caps and swaps   depreciation of personal property ffo basic     add back interest expense and amortization of loan costs on convertible debentures  weighted average additional shares assuming debenture conversion  sub total after conversion of debentures     to arrive at ffo diluted deduct effect of antidilutive debentures   impact of stock options and restricted stock using the treasury method ffo diluted     calculated based upon basic net income as adjusted to reach basic ffo 
weighted average number of shares includes the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding for assuming the conversion of op units 
the computation of dilutive and diluted average number of shares outstanding includes the effect of common stock options outstanding and restricted stock using the treasury method 
convertible debentures are antidilutive and are not included 
included in minimum rents were rents attributable to the accounting practice of straight lining of rents 
the amount of straight lining of rents that impacted minimum rents was  for   for and  for inflation in the last three years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of a relatively low inflation rate 
most of the leases at the centers have rent adjustments periodically through the lease term 
these rent increases are either in fixed increments or based on increases in the consumer price index 
in addition  many of the leases are for terms of less than ten years  which enables the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rents if the rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
additionally  most of the leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses 
this reduces the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation
