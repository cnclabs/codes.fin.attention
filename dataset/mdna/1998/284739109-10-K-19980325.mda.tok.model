item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sale of product to american airlines  inc employees was not material in fiscal and did not impact seasonality 
since the company is selling travel related products to pilots and flight attendants  there is little seasonality  as the customers are using the products on a daily basis as part of their normal work routine 
the expansion of this business to additional airports or to other airlines may eventually have the effect of decreasing the company s overall seasonality 
the company anticipates that its acquisition of essex and the development of its clec business also will eventually impact the company s overall seasonality trends by making quarterly revenues less divergent 
design and merchandising the company s licensed and branded products feature dynamic and colorful new styles that use innovative graphics and product designs and are constructed of quality fabrics and other materials 
in order to continue to provide high quality designs for both its licensed and non licensed products  the company established a design development center employing creative and merchandising professionals who work with state of the art resources 
in addition  the company actively solicits participation from key customers in the development of specific products 
the company s design and merchandising department  which is based out of the company s headquarters  emphasizes creativity and responsiveness to consumer preferences in the development of new products 
the design and merchandising department  together with the company s marketing personnel  evaluates the designs and fashion trends in the marketplace and applies these in its product development 
the company s design and marketing personnel frequently visit customers  suppliers and trade shows and conduct market research to identify developing consumer trends and new product ideas 
license agreements the company has licensing agreements which allow it to produce and sell luggage  sport bags and related travel accessories bearing the trade names of dunlop  generra  gold s gym  hedgren  koosh  maui and sons  and perry ellis 
sales by the company under trademarked names licensed from others accounted for approximately  and of the company s net sales during the fiscal years ended november   and  respectively 
the company s licenses generally entitle the company to use the names  symbols and logos of the licensors on an exclusive basis in the manufacture and sale of the company s products within a defined territory 
all of the company s licenses call for a royalty to be paid to the licensor based on a percentage of net sales  except for the license for hedgren products  which is based on a percentage of net purchases 
royalties vary by product and licensor and generally range from to of net sales 
minimum payments are applied against royalty fees either over the term of the contract or annually  depending on the contract 
in addition  the licenses generally require payments by the company to certain promotional programs sponsored by the licensor 
the company s license agreements generally have terms of three years 
the terms of renewal options are negotiated and vary on a license by license basis 
the company recently negotiated the termination of its license to sell luggage and luggage related products bearing the skechers name and logo 
the company s license for cherokee products expired on december  and was not renewed 
the company believes that  in fiscal  it can replace the sales of products bearing the cherokee name with sales of its dunlop and mondo products 
during fiscal  the company received notification from airway industries inc airway that airway would not renew its license agreement with the company pursuant to which sirco international canada limited  the company s canadian subsidiary sirco canada  was granted an exclusive license to sell in canada  luggage and luggage related products under the trade names atlantic and oleg cassini through december  during the fiscal years ended november   and  sales of atlantic product approximated   and  respectively  which represented approximately  and  respectively  of the company s total net sales for those periods  and approximately  and  respectively  of the total net sales of sirco canada for those periods 
sirco canada lost approximately  in the fiscal year ended november  and earned approximately  and  in fiscal years ended november  and  respectively 
in addition  following receipt of notification from airway and douglas turner  then the president of sirco canada and a director of the company  that airway and mr 
turner had mutually agreed to airway s future employment of mr 
turner in its efforts to distribute directly its products in canada  the company terminated its employment of mr 
turner in september the loss of the airway license had an adverse effect on the company s results of operations for the fiscal year ending november  after extensive negotiations with fila sport spa fila  in february  the company and fila entered into an agreement pursuant to which the company ceased shipping fila product under a non exclusive license with fila during fiscal net sales of the fila product for the fiscal years ended november  and were approximately  including approximately  sold to fila and  respectively  or and  respectively  of the company s total net sales 
the loss of the ability to sell product bearing the fila trademark had an adverse effect on the company s results of operations through the fiscal year ending november  although the company continuously explores the licensing of new trademarked names  future net sales could be negatively impacted if sales from new licenses or increases in sales under the existing licenses do not replace the sales of fila product 
trademarks the company sells products under proprietary trade names and logos  including cross trainer  jt madison  mondo  and sirco kids  all of which are registered in the united states 
the company considers its trademarks to be of considerable value to its business and intends to protect them to the fullest extent practicable 
the company takes all reasonable measures to assure that any product bearing a company owned trademark or logo reflects the consistency and quality associated with its products bearing licensed trademarks or logos 
backlog a substantial portion of net sales is based on orders for immediate delivery and therefore  backlog is not necessarily indicative of future net sales 
suppliers the company s luggage  sport bag  backpack and related products are primarily produced by various manufacturers in indonesia  the people s republic of china  the philippines  taiwan and thailand 
although the simultaneous loss of several of these manufacturers would temporarily adversely affect the company s business  the company is of the opinion that generally these manufacturers could be replaced by others 
the company s business could also be adversely affected by a disadvantageous change in the exchange rate of the dollar with certain foreign currencies  by changes in tariffs or import restrictions  as well as political and economic conditions in the countries from which it imports 
for the fiscal years ended november   and  the company s products were manufactured in the following countries fiscal fiscal fiscal china taiwan thailand philippines indonesia korea other the company purchases products for its american airlines employee stores from various domestic suppliers who have license agreements to sell product displaying the american airlines  inc logo or trade name 
the company also buys non logo product from a variety of domestic sources 
competition the company experiences substantial competition in most of its luggage  sport bag  backpack and related product categories from a number of well established domestic and foreign distributors  some of which have greater financial resources than the company 
the company believes the principal competitive factors affecting its business are styling  pricing and distribution 
increased competition by existing and future competitors could result in reductions in sales or prices of the company s products that could materially impair the company s profitability 
in addition  a substantial portion of the company s products are sold under non exclusive licensing agreements 
although the company has been successful in obtaining and renewing such licenses  there can be no assurance that existing competitors will not obtain competing licenses in the future or that additional large  well financed companies will not enter the licensed luggage  sport bag or backpack business 
because the company imports its manufactured goods from overseas suppliers  delivery to its customers is dependent upon the timing of overseas manufacturing and shipping schedules  which may put the company at a competitive disadvantage to domestic manufacturers 
the company expects that it will face significant competition in connection with its proposed entry into the telecommunications industry 
the company expects to experience significant competition for its proposed local telephone services  including local exchange services  from incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs  which currently dominate their local telecommunications markets  and others  including other clecs 
ilecs have long standing relationships with their customers which may create significant competitive barriers 
furthermore  ilecs may have the potential to subsidize competitive service from monopoly service revenues 
in addition  a continuing trend toward business combinations and alliances in the telecommunications industry may create significant additional competitors 
the company will also face competition in its proposed markets and in most other markets into which it may expand from one or more clecs operating fiber optic networks 
most of the company s existing and potential competitors in the telecommunications industry have financial  personnel and other resources significantly greater than those of the company 
employees at february   the company employed employees  of which were employed on a full time basis and two were employed on a part time basis  and had approximately independent sales representatives 
at such date  approximately of the company s employees were employed in the company s executive offices in stamford  connecticut  approximately were employed in the company s warehouse in la mirada  california  nine were employed in the company s american airlines store in dallas  texas  one was employed in the company s showroom facility in new york  new york  and three were employed in the company s canadian showroom and warehouse facilities in ontario  canada 
the company is not subject to any collective bargaining agreement and believes that its relationship with its employees is good 
recent developments on february   the company commenced operations in the telecommunications industry by acquiring essex  a startup clec that has filed in new jersey  new york and connecticut to become a reseller of local telephone services 
the company believes that essex is positioning itself to take advantage of the opportunities created by the telecommunications act of the telecommunications act  which requires the regional bell operating companies rbocs to perform a number of duties  including allowing local telephone service competition  in order to qualify for long distance entry in their local service areas 
essex believes that it will be able to gain rapid market entry because it is a non facilities based provider and will therefore not incur the significant costs and developmental delays that are inherent in constructing network and transmission facilities 
furthermore  essex intends to take advantage of telecom relationships established by the company s affiliate  chc  which has negotiated favorable long distance rates and voice mail rates from third party providers  and will not incur extra time or expense having to negotiate such agreements 
where possible  essex will attempt to provide service to chc s multi state customers that also have business locations in the new york metropolitan area 
all of the telecommunications operations of essex are subject to state and federal regulations 
essex must obtain and maintain certificates of public convenience and necessity from most states in which it plans to offer services 
many comprehensive changes in the regulatory environment have already occurred as a result of the telecommunications act  and essex cannot predict how the relevant provisions of the telecommunications act will evolve and be interpreted by federal and state regulators  courts and the rbocs 
the timing and terms of any resale agreement between essex and a rboc is at least partially controlled by the individual rboc  although the rbocs have the duty to negotiate the resale agreements on a good faith basis 
essex has been negotiating with bell atlantic corporation and has executed a resale agreement for new jersey  in addition to various other operational agreements  such as on line access to computer facilities

factors that might cause such a difference include  among others  general economic and business conditions  industry trends  the loss of major customers  dependence on foreign sources of supply  the loss of licenses  availability of management  availability  terms and deployment of capital  the seasonal nature of the company s business  and changes in state and federal regulations of the telecommunications industry 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales for fiscal year decreased by approximately  to approximately  as compared to approximately  reported in fiscal net sales for the company s united states and canadian operations decreased in fiscal by approximately  and  respectively  from amounts reported in the prior fiscal year 
this decline in net sales is primarily attributable to three developments the company s loss of the license to sell fila product see below in the united states  effective in june  the company s loss of the license to sell airway product see below in canada  effective in december  and a decrease in demand in the united states for the company s other mature brand names 
this decline in sales was partially offset by sales growth in new licenses that were signed in for the perry ellis and hedgren brand names 
net sales per brand name for the two fiscal years were as follows fiscal fiscal increase decrease perry ellis  hedgren    fila   airway    other brand names    total brand names    unlicensed product    total net sales    the company s gross profit for fiscal decreased by approximately  to approximately  from approximately  in fiscal  and the gross profit percentage in fiscal decreased to from in fiscal the decrease in gross profit percentage is attributable to the discontinuance of certain products in fiscal for which the company recorded an inventory reserve of approximately  the lack of a sufficiently large revenue base over which to spread fixed costs and to a change in product mix 
the change in product mix has two components 
first  fiscal sales contained a higher percentage of unlicensed products  which traditionally have a lower gross profit margin  and second  fiscal sales contained the new brand names of perry ellis and hedgren  as compared to the more established brand names of fila and atlantic in fiscal established brand name products generally are able to demand a higher gross margin than less established brand name products  which are vying for shelf space with other new products from competitors 
after extensive negotiations in february  the company and fila entered into an agreement pursuant to which the company ceased shipping products under the fila license on june  the company sold approximately  of fila product in fiscal compared to no sales of fila product in fiscal the loss of the fila trademark had an adverse impact on the company s results of operations in the fiscal year ended november   and will have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations for the fiscal year ending november  during fiscal  airway notified the company that it would not renew its license agreement with the company  pursuant to which sirco canada was granted an exclusive license to sell in canada luggage and luggage related products under the trade names atlantic and oleg cassini through december  in november  the company entered into an asset purchase agreement with airway  whereby airway agreed  among other things  to purchase any remaining atlantic inventory owned by sirco canada on december   to purchase certain fixed assets and to enter into a two year lease for a substantial portion of the premises owned by sirco canada at fair market value 
in november  the company restructured sirco canada  hired a new president to run the operation and started to market the company s other licensed products in canada 
sirco canada sold approximately  of airway product in the first quarter of fiscal prior to the december  termination date

the company anticipates that the skechers sales volume in fiscal will be replaced by new licenses see below that the company believes will have a greater level of acceptance in the marketplace 
on december   the company s license for cherokee products expired and was not renewed 
the company believes that sales of cherokee products will be replaced by an increase in sales of the company s dunlop and mondo products in fiscal the company continuously evaluates potential licenses and seeks to determine the value an individual trade name will add to its product mix 
licensed trade names can help give the company a marketing advantage with certain retailers over similar products offered by competitors 
the company started shipping products under the perry ellis and hedgren trade names in fiscal and recorded aggregate net sales for these products of approximately  in fiscal  compared to aggregate net sales of approximately  in fiscal the company has recently introduced new products under the trade names of koosh  which is for children s products  and maui and sons  which is for active young men s and children s products

the company believes that  although a licensed name can often help the company sell a product  the excellent service and high quality products provided by the company to its customers  regardless of what name is on the product  will result in most of the company s customers reordering products from the company based primarily on quality and value  and  to a lesser extent  on the trade name 
selling  warehouse and general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately  to approximately  from approximately  in fiscal the reduction in expenses is attributable to lower selling expenses as a result of the reduction in net sales  and lower warehousing and general and administrative expenses as a result of the restructuring of the company s canadian operation

net cash provided by used in operating activities aggregated approximately   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the increase of approximately  in net cash used in operating activities in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily reflects the poor operating results for fiscal as compared to fiscal and the need to maintain higher inventory levels than normal to generate sales 
the increase of approximately  in net cash provided by operating results in as compared to  reflects improved operating results between the two years and a lower level of inventory being required to generate sales

approximately  of net cash was used to pay long term debt in fiscal in fiscal  approximately  of net cash was used to repay short term debt and approximately  was used to repay long term debt 
in fiscal  the company received  in proceeds from the exercise of stock options

management believes that the company s present sources of financing  combined with its present working capital and cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to meet the cash and capital requirements for the company s travel division for the next twelve months 
however  if the depressed levels of sales do not increase or the company is unable to improve its cash position by raising additional capital  the company may experience temporary cash shortages 
such cash shortages may negatively impact the company s ability to purchase inventory in a timely manner  which could negatively impact the company s results of operations 
the company anticipates that it will need to raise up to million to meet the cash requirements for its telecommunications division contemplated by the fiscal business plan for that division 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to obtain such funding when needed  or that such funding  if available  will be obtainable on terms acceptable to the company 
the failure by the company to raise the necessary funds to finance its telecommunications operations will have an adverse effect on the ability of the company to carry out its business plan for its telecommunications division
