item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s core business is acquiring and leasing  primarily pursuant to operating leases  commercial aircraft spare engines and other aircraft equipment 
the company  through wasi  also specializes in the purchase and resale of aftermarket airframe and engine parts  engines  modules and rotable components 
in addition  the company engages in the selective purchase and resale of commercial aircraft engines 
revenue consists primarily of operating lease revenue  income from the leasing and sale of spare parts and components and income from the sale of engines and equipment 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue is summarized as follows year ended december  amount amount dollars in thousands operating lease revenue   gain on sale of leased equipment  spare parts sales   sale of equipment acquired for resale   finance lease revenue interest and other income total   lease portfolio 
during  engines  aircraft  and spare parts packages were added to the company s lease portfolio at a total cost of million 
nine engines were sold or transferred from the portfolio 
leasing activities 
operating lease revenue for the year ended december   increased to million from million for the comparable period in this increase reflects lease revenues from additional engines and spare parts packages 
in late june  the company entered into two finance leases 
finance lease income generated from these transactions totaled  for the period ended december  there were no comparable transactions for the year ended december  expenses directly related to operating lease activity increased to million 
interest expense related to all leasing activities increased to million for the year ended december   from the comparable period in  due primarily to an increased loan base and the replacement of an existing facility with a new loan agreement in the first quarter of bearing a higher interest rate 
depreciation expense increased to million for the year ended december   from the comparable period in  due to the larger asset base in residual sharing expense increased to million for the year ended december   from the million for the comparable period in this expense is calculated by comparing the net book value of the engines subject to such agreements to their related debt balances and adjusting the residual share payable to the appropriate amount representing the sharing percentage of any excess of the net book value over the corresponding debt balance for the engines subject to residual sharing 
gain on sale of leased engines 
during the year ended december   the company sold engines from the lease portfolio 
these engines had a net book value of million and they were sold for a gain of million 
spare parts sales 
revenues from spare parts sales increased to million 
the gross margin  decreased to in  from in the corresponding period in sale of equipment acquired for resale 
during the year ended december   the company sold engines for million which resulted in a gain of million  compared to the year ended december   during which the company sold engines for million resulting in a gain of million 
included in the sales was one transaction involving the sale of four engines acquired at a cost of  and sold for a gain of  equipment sales opportunities and profitability may vary materially from period to period 
interest and other income 
interest and other income for the year ended december   increased to million from million for the year ended december  this is a result of interest earned on deposits held  primarily the proceeds from the initial public offering 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from the comparable period in this increase reflects expenses associated with staff additions  increased rent due to the expansion of the wasi facility  as well as an increase in professional fees  insurance expense and public company costs 
income taxes 
income taxes  exclusive of tax on extraordinary items  for the year ended december   increased to million from million for the comparable period in this increase reflects an increase in the company s pre tax earnings 
extraordinary item 
in february  the company obtained a new loan agreement for million to replace an existing loan of million 
the transaction resulted in an extraordinary gain of million  net of tax 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue is summarized as follows year ended december  amount amount dollars in thousands revenue leasing activities   gain loss on sale of leased equipment spare parts sales   sale of equipment acquired for resale   interest and other income total   lease portfolio 
at december   the company had engines in its operating lease portfolio 
during  four engines were either transferred or sold from the lease portfolio 
one of the four engines was transferred at its net book value to wasi and dismantled for spare parts sales 
the remaining three engines were sold to third parties 
in addition  another engine from the lease portfolio was sold under a sale and leaseback agreement and is now reflected on the company s balance sheet as an engine on capital lease 
in the third quarter of  the company acquired one engine for million and in the fourth quarter of  the company acquired four engines for a total cost of approximately million  as well as two auxiliary power units apu s and a spare parts package for a total cost of approximately million 
at december   the company held engines and spare parts packages in its lease portfolio 
operating leases 
operating lease revenue for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the corresponding period in this decrease is primarily due to a decrease in revenue from one engine which was off lease and in a repair facility for eight months in and two engines which were sold in  offset slightly by five engines purchased and leased late in in  expenses directly related to operating lease activity dropped to million from million in the reduction in expenses in was due to a reduction in depreciation expenses of million as a result of two engines in that were fully depreciated and the sale of two engines in the third quarter of interest expense dropped million in from  due primarily to the modification of the then existing term loan with marine midland bank the midland loan in june resulting in more favorable interest rates 
residual sharing expenses  however  increased to  in from the corresponding period in due to changes in the company s portfolio of engines subject to such agreements 
this expense is calculated by comparing the net book value of these engines to their related debt balances and adjusting the residual share payable to the appropriate amount representing the sharing percentage of any excess of the net book value over the corresponding debt balance for the six engines subject to residual sharing 
gain loss on sale of leased engines 
the loss in was attributable to unanticipated overhaul expenses of  required in order to prepare an engine for resale and a  loss on the sale of the engine 
spare parts sales 
revenues from spare parts sales increased to million primarily due to increased volume 
gross margin rose to in from in the corresponding period in  primarily due to a change in the mix of parts sold and the gross margins related thereto 
sale of equipment acquired for resale 
during the year ended december   the company sold four engines for proceeds of million  generating gains of million 
in  the company sold three engines for million  a fuselage and miscellaneous components it acquired in connection with an aircraft purchase for  and other components for  the aggregate cost of the equipment sold was million and million in and  respectively 
interest and other income 
interest and other income for increased to  from  in  an increase of 
this increase was due primarily to increased marketing brokerage fee income earned on one engine  nonrecurring credits due the company regarding excessive engine overhaul costs and an increase in interest earned on the net proceeds from the initial public offering  as well as interest earned on certain engine security deposits 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in  up from million in this increase reflects additional compensation due to an increased workforce and increased bonus payments  increased telephone and travel costs due to increased marketing personnel and activity  increased rent due to the expansion of the wasi facility and an increase in professional fees and insurance as a result of the initial public offering 
gain on modification of credit facility 
in  the company modified the terms of the midland loan 
the gain of million in on the modification of credit facility reflects a gain from the removal of residual sharing provisions of million and a  loss on the sale of two engines to the lender 
income taxes 
income taxes decreased to million in from million in the company s effective tax rates for federal and state taxes was approximately and in and  respectively 
therefore  the decrease in tax expense was due to the decrease in the company s income before taxes and minority interest offset by a slight increase in the effective tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company has financed its growth through borrowings secured by its lease portfolio 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations above and business aircraft equipment financing source of funds 
cash of approximately million  million  and million in the years ended december   and  respectively  was derived from this activity 
in these same time periods  million  million and million  respectively  was used to pay down related debt 
in december  net proceeds from a secondary common stock offering were approximately million  as discussed below 
in  net proceeds from the initial public offering were approximately million  as discussed below 
cash flows from operating activities generated approximately million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company s primary use of funds is for the purchase of equipment for operating and finance lease 
approximately million  million  and million of funds were used for this purpose in the years ended december   and  respectively 
additional funds were used in these periods to finance the growth of inventories to support parts sales 
the secondary offering which occurred in december was for  shares of common stock at per share 
the proceeds to the company  net of all expenses  were million 
the primary use of these proceeds was repayment of amounts outstanding under the company s revolving credit facility 
the initial public offering which occurred in september was for  shares of common stock at per share 
the proceeds to the company  net of all expenses  were million 
these proceeds were used to prepay million of indebtedness under an existing term facility  and to purchase an amortizing interest rate cap to hedge a portion of the company s exposure to increases in interest rates on its variable rate borrowings for a cost of  the balance of the proceeds  together with debt financing  were used to acquire additional engines for lease  to acquire engine and airframe component inventory  and for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
until february  the company s primary lender was marine midland bank midland 
prior to june  the midland loan provided  among other things  for interest payable at libor plus to  required a specified percentage of lease payments to be applied to debt service but required final payment only upon the sale of the subject engine  and provided to the lender a share of the residual value of financed engines 
in june  the company modified the midland loan 
as part of the modification  the midland loan was converted to a ten year  full payout loan  the existing residual sharing arrangement with the lender was terminated  the interest rate was reduced to libor plus  and the lender acquired two engines from the company with a net book value of million 
this modification resulted in a gain to the company of million 
in february   the company repaid the midland loan at a discount which resulted in an extraordinary book gain  net of tax and related costs  of approximately million 
the transaction was financed through a loan of million from a financial institution at an interest rate of libor plus 
in december  a substantial portion of this loan was repaid from proceeds of the funding corp 
facility defined below 
the remainder of the loan was to mature in february but has been extended to june as of december   million was outstanding under this facility 
the company has a revolving credit facility to finance the acquisition of engines and high value spare parts for sale or lease 
assuming compliance with the facility s terms  including sufficiency of collateral  at december  and march   million and million was available under this facility  respectively 
fifteen million of this facility matures on may  and the remainder of the facility expires on june  the facility bore interest at prime plus 
on december  and may be renewed annually 
the company has an million warehouse facility  available to a special purpose finance subsidiary of the company  for the financing of jet aircraft engines transferred by the company to such finance subsidiary the funding corp 
facility 
this transaction s structure facilitates future public or private securitized note issuances by the special purpose finance subsidiary 
this facility has an eight year term and bears interest at libor plus 
this facility requires the issuer to hedge of the facility against interest rate changes no later than april  assuming compliance with the facilities terms  including sufficiency of collateral  as of december  and march   million and million was available under this facility  respectively 
wasi has a million secured working capital facility for the acquisition of engines to be dismantled and sold for parts through wasi 
this facility provides for advances against the purchase price of parts for resale and bears interest at prime plus 
this facility requires interest only payments for the first five months with the principal balance due six months after drawdown and expires on april  the company directly guarantees wasi s obligations under this facility 
assuming compliance with the facilities terms  including sufficiency of collateral  as of december  and march   approximately million and million was available under this facility respectively 
approximately million of the company s debt is repayable during the majority of such repayments consist of scheduled balloon payment maturities on term loans 
the balance of the repayments consist of scheduled installments due under term loans 
a portion of the balloon payment maturities was refinanced subsequent to year end under the company s million warehouse facility 
the company anticipates that it will refinance the remaining balloon payment maturities during the course of the company believes that its current equity base and internally generated funds are sufficient to fund the company s anticipated equity requirements operations for at least months  at which time additional equity may be required to fund projected growth 
the company believes its current credit facilities are sufficient to fund the company s debt capital needs into the second quarter of the company is seeking to expand its existing revolving credit facility and make other borrowing arrangements to fund future growth 
the company s ability to successfully execute its business strategy is dependent in part on its ability to raise equity capital and to obtain debt capital 
there can be no assurance that the necessary amount of such equity or debt capital will continue to be available to the company on favorable terms  or at all 
if the company were unable to continue to obtain required financing on favorable terms  the company s ability to add new engines and parts packages to its portfolio or to conduct profitable operations with its existing asset base would be impaired  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   the company had engines and spare parts packages which had not been financed 
the company will likely seek financing for this equipment  although no assurance can be given that such financing will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
in addition  certain of the company s engines have been financed under floating rate facilities 
until fixed rate financing for these assets is in place  the company is subject to interest rate risk  since the underlying lease revenue is fixed 
see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations interest rate risks below 
between december  and march   the company and wasi purchased nine engines for the lease portfolio and one engine for the parts operation 
the total cost of these purchases was approximately million 
these purchases were funded with cash and borrowings under the company s revolving line of credit and the funding corp 
facility 
additionally  the company committed  subject to documentation  to purchase  during and  certain used aircraft for its wasi parts operation 
certain deposits have and will be made in connection with this commitment and the total commitment to purchase over the course of and is not more than million 
management of interest rate exposure at december   million of the company s borrowings were on a variable rate basis at various interest rates tied to either libor or the prime rate 
the company s equipment leases are generally structured at fixed rental rates for specified terms 
to date  this variable rate borrowing has resulted in lower interest expense for the company 
increases in interest rates could narrow or eliminate the spread  or result in a negative spread  between the rental revenue the company realizes under its leases and the interest rate that the company pays under its borrowings 
see risk factors interest rate risks 
in september  the company purchased an amortizing interest rate cap in order to limit its exposure to increases in interest rates on a portion of its variable rate borrowings 
pursuant to this cap  the counter party will make payments to the company  based on the notional amount of the cap  if the three month libor rate is in excess of 
as of december   the notional principal amount of the cap was million and said amount will decline to million at the end of its term 
the cost of the cap is being amortized as an expense over a four year period 
the company will be exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance of the interest rate cap counter party 
risk factors in addition to other information in this report  the following risk factors should be considered carefully by potential purchasers in evaluating an investment in the common stock of the company 
except for historical information contained herein  the discussions in this report contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of the company s plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
the cautionary statements made in this report should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements wherever they appear in this report 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below as well as those discussed elsewhere herein 
ownership risks the company leases its portfolio of aircraft engines  aircraft and spare parts packages primarily under operating leases as opposed to finance leases 
under an operating lease  the company retains title to the aircraft equipment and assumes the risk of not recovering its entire investment in the aircraft equipment through the re leasing and remarketing process 
operating leases require the company to re lease or sell aircraft equipment in its portfolio in a timely manner upon termination of the lease in order to minimize off lease time and recover its investment in the aircraft equipment 
numerous factors  many of which are beyond the control of the company  may have an impact on the company s ability to re lease or sell aircraft equipment on a timely basis 
among the factors are general market conditions  regulatory changes particularly those imposing environmental  maintenance and other requirements on the operation of aircraft engines  changes in the supply or cost of the aircraft equipment and technological developments 
further  the value of a particular used aircraft engine or aircraft varies greatly depending upon its condition  the number of hours remaining until the next major maintenance of the aircraft engine aircraft part or aircraft is required and general conditions in the airline industry 
in addition  the success of an operating lease depends in part upon having the aircraft equipment returned by the lessee in marketable condition as required by the lease 
consequently  there can be no assurance that the company s estimated residual value for the aircraft equipment will be realized 
as of december   the company had engines  aircraft and parts packages under lease to customers in countries additional engines were off lease  one of which was leased in january if the company is unable to re lease or sell the aircraft equipment on favorable terms  its business  financial condition  cash flow  ability to service debt and results of operations could be adversely affected 
the company  through wasi  also acquires aviation equipment such as whole engines and aircraft which can be dismantled and sold as parts 
before parts may be installed in an aircraft  they must meet certain standards of condition established by the federal aviation administration 
see government regulations below 
parts must also be traceable to sources deemed acceptable by the faa 
see business spare parts sales 
parts owned by the company may not meet applicable standards or standards may change  causing parts which are already in the company s inventory to be scrapped or modified 
engine manufacturers may also develop new parts to be used in lieu of parts already contained in the company s inventory 
in all such cases  to the extent the company has such parts in its inventory  their value may be reduced 
in addition  if the company does not sell airframe and engine component parts that it purchases in the time frame contemplated at acquisition  the company may be subject to unanticipated inventory financing costs as well as all the risks of ownership described above 
the company also engages in the selective purchase and resale of commercial aircraft engines and engine components in the aftermarket 
on occasion  the company purchases engines or components without having a commitment for their sale 
if the company were to purchase an engine or component without having a firm commitment for its sale or if a firm commitment for sale were to exist but not be consummated for whatever reason  the company would be subject to all the risks of ownership described above 
industry risks downturns in the air transportation industry affect each of the three components of the company s business 
in particular  substantial increases in fuel costs or interest rates  increased fare competition  slower growth in air traffic  or any significant downturn in the general economy could adversely affect the air transportation industry and may therefore negatively impact the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
while the company believes that its lease terms protect its aircraft equipment and the company s investment in such aircraft equipment  there can be no assurance that the financial difficulties experienced by a number of airlines will not have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
in recent years and as discussed in customer credit risks below  a number of commercial airlines have experienced financial difficulties  in some cases resulting in bankruptcy proceedings 
customer credit risks a lessee may default in performance of its lease obligations and the company may be unable to enforce its remedies under a lease 
the company s existing and prospective customers include smaller domestic and foreign passenger airlines  freight and package carriers and charter airlines  which  together with major passenger airlines  may suffer from the factors which have historically affected the airline industry 
as a result  certain of these customers may pose credit risks to the company 
the company s inability to collect receivables due under a lease or to repossess aircraft equipment in the event of a default by a lessee could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
a number of airlines have experienced financial difficulties  certain airlines have filed for bankruptcy and a number of such airlines have ceased operations 
in most cases where a debtor seeks protection under chapter of title of the united states code the bankruptcy code  creditors are automatically stayed from enforcing their rights 
in the case of united states certified airlines  section of the bankruptcy code provides certain relief to lessors of the aircraft equipment 
specifically  the debtor airline has days from the date the airline seeks protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code to agree to perform its obligations and to cure any defaults 
if it does not do so  the lessor may repossess the aircraft equipment 
the scope of section has been the subject of significant litigation and there can be no assurance that the provisions of section will protect the company s investment in an aircraft engine in the event of a lessee s bankruptcy 
in addition  section does not apply to lessees located outside of the united states and applicable foreign laws may not provide comparable protection 
during the three years ended december   four lessees of the company filed for bankruptcy protection or otherwise became insolvent or ceased operations 
in two of these cases the company s engines were returned and re leased 
in the third case  the lessee was acquired by another airline and the lease continues 
on october   western pacific airlines  inc  west pac a domestic lessee of three of the company s engines with a combined net book value of million  filed a petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code in the district of colorado 
in that case  west pac cured all defaults under its leases with the company 
in march  west pac and the company entered into a stipulation wherein the three engines have been returned to the company 
the company believes it will not have a problem re leasing these engines 
on february   pan american airways corporation  a domestic lessee with one spare parts package with a book value of million the pan am lease  filed a petition under chapter the bankruptcy code in florida 
the company believes its lawfully terminated the pan am lease prior to the bankruptcy 
it has possession of the majority of the spare parts in the pan am lease in value terms and believes it should obtain possession of most of the remaining spare parts 
the company intends to re lease or sell these spare parts 
fluctuations in operating results the company has experienced fluctuations in its quarterly operating results and anticipates that these fluctuations may continue 
such fluctuations may be due to a number of factors  including the timing of sales of engines and spare parts and engine marketing activities fluctuation of and activities margins on such  unanticipated early lease terminations  the timing of engine acquisitions or a default by a lessee 
given the possibility of such fluctuations  the company believes that comparisons of the results of its operations for preceding quarters are not necessarily meaningful and that results for any prior quarter should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
in the event the company s revenues or earnings for any quarter are less than the level expected by securities analysts or the market in general  such shortfall could have an immediate and significant adverse impact on the market price of the company s common stock 
international risks in  approximately of the company s lease revenue was generated by leases to foreign customers of which of lease revenue which was generated by leases to asian customers 
such international leases may present greater risks to the company because certain foreign laws  regulations and judicial procedures may not be as protective of lessor rights as those which apply in the united states 
in addition  many foreign countries have currency and exchange laws regulating the international transfer of currencies 
the company attempts to minimize its currency and exchange risks by negotiating all of its lease transactions in us dollars and all guarantees obtained to support various lease agreements are denominated for payment in us dollars 
to date  the company has experienced some collection problems under certain leases with foreign airlines  and there can be no assurance that the company will not experience such collection problems in the future 
the company may also experience collection problems related to the enforcement of its lease agreements under foreign local laws and the attendant remedies in such locales 
consequently  the company is subject to the timing and access to courts and the remedies local laws impose in order to collect its lease payments and recover its assets 
in addition  political instability abroad and changes in international policy also present risks associated with expropriation of the company s leased engines 
to date  the company has experienced limited problems in reacquiring assets  however  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience more serious problems in the future 
certain countries have no registration or other recording system with which to locally establish the company s or its lender s interest in the engines and related leases  potentially making it more difficult for the company to prove its interest in an engine in the event that it needs to recover an engine located in such a country 
the company s engines and the aircraft on which they are installed can be subject to certain foreign taxes and airport fees 
consequently  unexpected liens on an engine or the aircraft on which it is installed could be imposed in favor of a foreign entity  such as eurocontrol or the airports of the united kingdom 
dependence upon availability of financing the operating lease business is a capital intensive business 
the company s typical operating lease transaction requires a cash investment by the company of approximately to of the aircraft equipment purchase price  commonly known as an equity investment 
the company s equity investments have historically been financed from internally generated cash  the net proceeds of the company s initial public offering which was completed on september  at a price of per share the initial public offering  and the net proceeds of the secondary offering which was completed on december  at a price of per share 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the balance of the purchase price is typically financed with the proceeds of secured borrowings 
accordingly  the company s ability to successfully execute its business strategy and to sustain its operations is dependent  in part  on the availability of debt and equity capital 
there can be no assurance that the necessary amount of such capital will continue to be available to the company on favorable terms  or at all 
if the company were unable to continue to obtain required financing on favorable terms  the company s ability to add new leases to its portfolio and parts inventory would be limited  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company typically acquires the engines it leases with a combination of equity capital and funds borrowed from financial institutions 
in some circumstances  the company acquires assets before it has obtained debt financing 
there can be no assurance that debt financing will be available after the asset has been acquired or  if available  at attractive rates or terms 
factors that could cause debt financing to be more expensive or unavailable include changes in interest rates  financial conditions of the lessee or the company  prospects for the airline industry or the asset type as well as general economic conditions 
if debt financing is not available  a like amount of the company s equity capital would be unavailable for use to acquire additional assets  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
interest rate risks the company s engine leases are generally structured at fixed rental rates for specified terms 
as of december   borrowings subject to interest rate risk totaled million or of the company s total borrowings 
increases in interest rates could narrow or eliminate the spread  or result in a negative spread between the rental revenue the company realizes under its leases and the interest rate that the company pays under its lines of credit or loans 
in  the company purchased an amortizing interest rate cap which had a notional principal amount of million as of december   to reduce its interest rate exposure  however  there can be no assurance that the company s business  operating results or financial condition will not be adversely affected during any period of increases in interest rates 
competition in the medium term engine lease market segment  which is the company s target market  the company principally competes with shannon engine services  headquartered in shannon  ireland  which is owned by cfm 
the company also competes with rolls royce 
rolls royce limits its leasing activities to products of its parent company and related parties 
the bank of tokyo mitsubishi  through its affiliate engine lease finance in shannon  ireland  also competes with the company 
each of these competitors is substantially larger and has greater financial resources than the company which may permit  among other things  greater access to capital markets at more favorable terms 
in addition  certain major aircraft lessors  including international lease finance corporation and gecas  compete with the company to the extent that they include spare engine leases with their aircraft leases or may compete on transactions involving numerous engines 
with respect to engine marketing and spare parts and component sales  the company competes with airlines  engine manufacturers  aircraft  engine and parts brokers  and parts distributors 
the company s major competitors include aar  ages  the memphis group  aviation sales company  kellstrom industries and avteam  inc certain of these competitors may have  or may have access to  financial resources substantially greater than the company 
significant increases in competition encountered by the company in the future may limit the company s ability to expand its business  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the spare parts package leasing market  the company competes with aar  ages  aviation sales company  kellstrom industries and others 
in the commuter aircraft leasing market  the company competes with ages  gecas  the leasing arms of certain commuter aircraft manufacturers and others 
certain of the company s competitors have substantially greater resources than the company  including greater name recognition  larger inventories  a broader range of material  complementary lines of business and greater financial  marketing and other resources 
in addition  original equipment manufacturers oems  aircraft maintenance providers  faa certified repair facilities and other aviation aftermarket suppliers may vertically integrate into the aircraft engine leasing or aircraft engine spare parts sales industry  thereby significantly increasing industry competition 
a variety of potential actions by any of the company s competitors  including a reduction of product prices or the establishment by competitors of long term relationships with new or existing customers  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to compete effectively against present and future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
management of growth the company has recently experienced significant growth in revenues 
such growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on the company s managerial  operational and financial resources 
due to the company s rapid pace of growth during  the company hired three new officers an executive vice president and chief administrative officer  an executive vice president and chief financial officer and a senior vice president and general counsel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively manage the expansion of its operations  or that the company s systems  procedures or controls will be adequate to support the company s operations 
an inability to effectively manage growth could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
year the company s operations are not highly dependent on systems technology and management believes the company s exposure to loss as a result of year issues is minimal 
the company does not believe that the year issue will have a bearing on lessees ability to adhere to the terms of their lease agreements with the company 
however  it has been reported in the general press that airlines and the faa may have material year issues  which could effect their operations 
such an effect could impact future dealings with lessees and other customers 
acquisition and expansion risks one of the components of the company s growth strategy is the possible select acquisition of businesses complementary to the company s existing businesses and possible expansion into new aviation related activities 
the inability of the company to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to complete acquisitions or expansions on reasonable terms could adversely affect the company s ability to grow 
in addition  any acquisition or expansion made by the company may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt and future charges to earnings related to the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company also may experience difficulties in the assimilation of operations  services  products and personnel  an inability to sustain or improve historical revenue levels  the diversion of management s attention from ongoing business operations and the potential loss of key employees 
any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the acquisition of other equipment leasing companies or portfolios creates certain additional risks 
for example  because acquired leases have been originated by other companies  they are not subject to the company s underwriting policies and procedures and  therefore  may be subject to greater risks of payment delinquencies and charge offs 
in addition  acquired leases may consist of products not currently offered by the company  or offered only on a limited basis 
acquired leases may also increase the concentration of the company s portfolio of leases serviced in certain geographical regions or change the relative concentration of such portfolio among geographical regions 
acquired leases may not contain the same indemnification provisions  maintenance provisions  equipment residual value assumptions and other material terms as the company s current leases 
finally  the provisions of acquired leases may not adequately protect the company from claims arising out of the lessee s use of the acquired lease equipment 
product liability risks the company is exposed to product liability claims in the event that the use of its aircraft engines or parts is alleged to have resulted in bodily injury or property damage 
in addition to requiring indemnification under the terms of the lease  the company requires its lessees to carry the types of insurance customary in the air transportation industry  including comprehensive liability insurance and casualty insurance 
the company and  if applicable its lenders  are named as an additional insured on liability insurance policies carried by lessees  with the company or its lenders normally identified as the payee for loss and damage to the equipment 
the company monitors compliance with the insurance provisions of the leases 
to date  the company has not experienced any significant uninsured or insured aviation related claims and has not experienced any product liability claims related to its aircraft engines or parts 
however  an uninsured or partially insured claim  or claim for which third party indemnification is not available  could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
risk of changes in tax laws or accounting principles the company s leasing activities generate significant depreciation allowances that provide the company with substantial tax benefits on an ongoing basis 
in addition  the company s lessees currently enjoy favorable accounting and tax treatment by entering into operating leases 
any change to current tax laws or accounting principles that make operating lease financing less attractive could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
dependence on key management the company s business operations are dependent in part upon the expertise of certain key employees 
loss of the services of such employees  particularly charles f 
willis  iv  president and chief executive officer or edwin f 
dibble  the president of wasi  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company has entered into an employment agreement with mr 
dibble and the company maintains key man life insurance of million on mr 
willis and million on mr 
dibble
