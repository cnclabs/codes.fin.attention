item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in late  the company began implementing certain strategic initiatives in response to a significant deterioration in the company s operating performance and financial condition during the second half of this deterioration was primarily caused by i an overly aggressive expansion of twa s capacity and planned flight schedule  particularly during the summer season  which forced the company to rely disproportionately on lower yield feed traffic and bulk ticket sales to fill the increased capacity of its system  ii the delayed delivery of four older s intended to increase capacity for incremental international operations during the summer of  and iii unexpected maintenance delays due to the capacity increase  higher levels of scheduled narrow body heavy maintenance and increased contract maintenance performed for third parties 
these factors caused excessive levels of flight cancellations  poor on time performance  increased pilot training costs and higher maintenance expenditures and adversely affected the company s yields and unit costs 
in addition  the crash of twa flight on july  distracted management s attention from core operating issues and led to lost bookings and revenues 
the company also experienced a increase in fuel costs in versus  primarily due to a increase in the average fuel price paid per gallon during the year 
the primary focus of the company s new strategic initiatives commencing in late and continuing throughout was to reestablish twa s operational reliability and schedule integrity and overall product quality in order to attract higher yield passengers and enhance overall productivity  which should improve the company s financial results 
as the initial steps in implementing this strategy  the company temporarily reduced its flight schedule during the first quarter of to more closely match aircraft available for active service and worked to reduce the number of aircraft in maintenance backlog by increasing overtime and utilizing maintenance capacity made available by the termination of an unprofitable aircraft maintenance contract with the us government 
the other key initiatives which twa began implementing in late included i acceleration of the company s fleet renewal plan  ii a restructuring of twa s operations at jfk  iii a focus on improving productivity  iv implementation of a series of revenue enhancing marketing initiatives  and v implementation of a number of employee related initiatives to reinforce the company s focus on operational performance 
general the airline industry operates in an intensely competitive environment 
the industry is also cyclical due to  among other things  a close relationship of yields and traffic to general us and worldwide economic conditions 
small fluctuations in revenue per available seat mile rasm and cost per available seat mile casm can have a significant impact on the company s financial results 
the company has experienced significant losses excluding extraordinary items on an annual basis since the early s  except in when the company s combined operating profit was million 
the airline industry has consolidated in recent years as a result of mergers  alliances and liquidations  and further consolidation may occur in the future 
this consolidation has  among other things  enabled certain of the company s major competitors to expand their international operations and increase their domestic market presence 
the emergence and growth of low cost  low fare carriers in domestic markets represents an intense competitive challenge for the company  which has higher operating costs than many of such low fare carriers and fewer financial resources than many of its major competitors 
in many cases  such low cost carriers have initiated or triggered price discounting 
the labor agreements became amendable after august  negotiations on a new collective bargaining agreement with the iam with regard to the flight attendants commenced in july and are currently ongoing  and negotiations regarding the company s ground employees represented by the iam commenced in february and are currently ongoing 
at the request of the iam  a mediator was appointed on august  in connection with the negotiations on the collective bargaining agreement covering the ground employees 
negotiations on a new collective bargaining agreement with alpa commenced in june and are also currently ongoing 
while wage rates currently in effect will likely increase  management believes that it is essential that the company s labor costs remain favorable in comparison to its largest competitors 
the company will seek to continue to improve employee productivity as an offset to any wage increases and will continue to explore other ways to control and or reduce operating expenses 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining such productivity improvements or unit costs reductions 
in the opinion of management  the company s financial resources are not as great as those of most of its competitors  and therefore  any substantial increase in its labor costs as a result of any new labor agreements or any cessation or disruption of operations due to any strike or work action could be particularly damaging to the company 
there are a number of uncertainties relating to agreements with employees  the resolution of which could result in significant non cash charges to future operating results of the company 
shares granted or purchased at a discount under the esip will generally result in a charge equal to the fair value of shares granted plus the discount for shares purchased at the time when such shares are earned 
if the esip s target prices for the common stock are realized  the minimum aggregate charge for the years to the and target prices having been met would be approximately million based upon such target prices and the number of shares of common stock and employee preferred stock outstanding at january  the charge for any year  however  could be substantially higher if the then market price of the common stock exceeds certain target prices 
on february   the first target price of was realized and a grant of of the outstanding common stock and employee preferred stock will be made on july  based on the current number of outstanding shares of common stock and employee preferred stock and taking into account a credit with respect to the company s required contribution  the net contribution will be  shares and the non cash charge in the first quarter of will be approximately million 
in addition  on march   the market price of the company s common stock exceeded the target price for the grant for a day period 
as a result  the company will be required to make an additional contribution to the relevant employee trusts of of its common stock and employee preferred stock on july  based on the current number of outstanding shares of common stock and employee preferred stock  that contribution would be  shares and the non cash charge would be approximately million 
pursuant to the labor agreements  the company agreed to pay to employees represented by the iam a cash bonus for the amount by which overtime incurred by the iam from september through august was reduced below specified thresholds 
this amount was to be offset by the amount by which medical savings during the period for the same employees did not meet certain specified levels of savings 
the obligation is payable in three equal annual installments beginning in the company has estimated the net overtime bonus owed to the iam to be approximately million and has reflected this amount as a liability in the consolidated financial statements 
such amount reflects a reduction of approximately million pursuant to an agreement to reduce proportionately the obligation based upon the size of the reduction of indebtedness achieved by the regoranization 
the iam  while not providing a calculation of its own  has disputed the method by which management has computed the net overtime bonus and has indicated that it believes the amount due to the iam is much greater than the amount which has been estimated by management 
twa also entered into an agreement which provides for an adjustment to existing salary rates of labor represented employees based on the amount of the cash bonus for overtime ultimately paid to the employees represented by the iam as described in this paragraph 
the exact amount of such adjustment is not capable of being determined until the amount of the iam bonus payment is finally determined 
in addition  in connection with certain wage scale adjustments afforded to non contract employees  employees previously represented by the iffa have asserted and won an arbitration ruling with respect to the comparability of wage concessions made in that  if sustained  would require that the company provide additional compensation to such employees 
the company estimates that at december  such additional compensation that would be payable pursuant to the arbitration ruling would be approximately million 
the company denies any such obligation and is pursuing an appeal of the arbitration ruling and a court award affirming the ruling 
effective september   the company also reduced the overall compensation and benefits package for non contract employees so as to offset  in the company s view  any claims by such employees previously represented by iffa for any retroactive or prospective wage increases 
as such  no liability has been recorded by the company 
in connection with the reorganization  the company entered into a letter agreement with employees represented by alpa whereby if the company s flight schedule  as measured by block hours  does not exceed certain thresholds in and  a defined cash payment would be made to alpa 
the defined thresholds were exceeded during the measurements periods through december  and no amount was therefore owed to alpa as of that date 
a payment of approximately million was due under the agreement on august  for the period january through june management estimates that its aggregate obligation for is approximately million 
the company made a payment of million in january and anticipates payment of the remaining million on april  twa has historically experienced significant variations in quarterly and annual operating revenues and operating expenses and expects such variations to continue 
due to the greater demand for air travel during the summer months  airline industry revenues for the third quarter of the year are generally significantly greater than revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year and moderately greater than revenues in the second quarter of the year 
in the past  given the company s historical dependence on summer leisure travel  twa s results of operations have been particularly sensitive to such seasonality 
while the company  through an acceleration of its fleet renewal program and restructuring of its jfk operations  anticipates that the deseasonalization of operations affected thereby will reduce quarter to quarter fluctuations in the future  there can be no assurance that such deseasonalization will occur 
notwithstanding actions taken to date and planned by management to improve the company s future operating results and performance  the company anticipates reporting operating and net losses in the first quarter of  which losses may be substantial 
the company s results of operations have also been impacted by numerous other factors that are not necessarily seasonal 
among the uncertainties that might adversely impact twa s future results of operations are i competitive pricing and scheduling initiatives  ii the availability and cost of capital  iii increases in fuel and other operating costs  iv insufficient levels of air passenger traffic resulting from  among other things  war  threat of war  terrorism or changes in the economy  v governmental limitations on the ability of twa to service certain airports and or foreign markets  vi regulatory requirements necessitating additional capital expenditures  vii the outcome of certain ongoing labor negotiations  and viii the reduction in yield due to the continued implementation of a discount ticket program entered into by the company with karabu in connection with the reorganization on the terms currently sought to be applied by karabu  which terms are  in the opinion of the company  inconsistent with and in violation of  the agreement governing such program 
the company is unable to predict the potential impact of any of such uncertainties upon its future results of operations 
on july   twa flight crashed shortly after departure from jfk en route to paris  france 
there were no survivors among the passengers and crew members aboard the boeing aircraft 
the company is cooperating fully with all federal  state and local regulatory and investigatory agencies to ascertain the cause of the crash  which to date has not been determined 
the national transportation safety board held hearings relating to the crash in december and is continuing its investigation 
while twa is currently a defendant in a number of lawsuits relating to the crash  it is unable to predict the amount of claims which may ultimately be made against the company or how those claims might be resolved 
twa maintains substantial insurance coverage and  at this time  management has no reason to believe that such insurance coverage will not be sufficient to cover the claims arising from the crash 
therefore  twa believes that the resolution of such claims will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
the company is unable to identify or predict the extent of any adverse effect on its revenues  yields or results of operations which has resulted or may result from the public perception of the crash or from any future findings by the national transportation safety board 
following the crash of twa flight in july  the faa implemented new security measures primarily impacting international operations 
the company does not believe that these measures have had any material effect on its revenues or operating costs to date 
additionally  a special committee appointed by the president to review aviation safety and airport security issued its final report on february  the report contains several recommendations 
however  the company is unable to predict which recommendations will be adopted or their impact on the company s future operating results 
additional government mandated security measures could have a direct adverse impact on the company s operating costs to the extent any such costs are directly assessed to commercial airlines or  if funded through new taxes or user fees  could indirectly have an adverse impact on the company s future operating results in the event that the company is not able to fully pass on those charges in the form of ticket price increases 
management believes that the company benefitted from the expiration on december  of the ticket tax  which imposed certain taxes including a air passenger tax on tickets for domestic flights  a air cargo tax and a per person international departure tax 
the ticket tax was reinstated on august  and expired again on december  at the end of february  the ticket tax was reinstated effective march  through september  congress passed tax legislation reimposing and significantly modifying the ticket tax  effective october  the legislation includes the imposition of new excise tax and significant fee tax formulas over a multiple year period  an increase in the international departure tax  the imposition of a new arrivals tax  and the extension of the ticket tax to cover items such as the sale of frequent flier miles 
management believes that the imposition and modification of the ticket tax have a negative impact on the company  although neither the amount of such negative impact nor the benefit previously realized by its expiration can be precisely determined 
however  management believes that the recent tax legislation and any other increases of the ticket tax will result in higher costs to the company and or  if passed on to consumers in the form of increased ticket prices  might have an adverse effect on passenger traffic  revenue and or margins 
during the period from through  twa underwent two separate chapter reorganizations  the first in and the second in in connection with the reorganization  twa has applied fresh start reporting in accordance with sop which has resulted in the creation of a new reporting entity for accounting purposes and the company s assets and liabilities being adjusted to reflect fair values on the effective date 
a description of the adjustments to financial statements arising from consummation of the reorganization and the application of fresh start reporting is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
for accounting purposes  the effective date is deemed to be september  because of the application of fresh start reporting  the financial statements for periods after the reorganization are not comparable in all respects to the financial statements for periods prior to the reorganization 
similarly  the consolidated financial statements for the periods prior to the reorganization are not consistent with periods subsequent to the reorganization 
as a result of the application of fresh start reporting as of the effective date  substantial values were assigned to routes  gates and slots million and reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets million 
the company has evaluated its future cash flows and  notwithstanding the operating loss experienced since the effective date  expects that the carrying value of the intangibles at december  will be recovered 
however  the achievement of such improved future operating results and cash flows are subject to considerable uncertainties 
in future periods these intangibles will be evaluated for recoverability based upon estimated future cash flows 
if expectations are not substantially achieved  charges to future operations for impairment of those assets may be required and such charges could be material 
the company s ability to improve its financial position and meet its financial obligations will depend upon a variety of factors  including significantly improved operating results  favorable domestic and international airfare pricing environments  absence of adverse general economic conditions  more effective operating cost controls and efficiencies  and the company s ability to attract new capital and maintain adequate liquidity 
no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in generating the operating results or attracting new capital required for future viability

results of operations for the fiscal year ended december  compared to the fiscal year ended december  total operating revenues of  million for were million or less than the total operating revenues of  million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily reflected in twa passenger revenues  which were million less than in  resulting from the elimination of certain unprofitable international destinations and the planned reduction in capacity as the company replaced older l and b aircraft with new b  b and md aircraft on many routes 
additionally  revenues from contract work decreased million primarily due to the termination of an unprofitable aircraft maintenance contract with the u 
s 
government and overall reduction in other third party maintenance as the company focused its resources on maintenance of its own aircraft 
revenue from freight and mail also decreased million as a result of the reduction in capacity 
as a result of the company s planned retirement of older widebody aircraft and elimination of unprofitable services  capacity and traffic decreased in as compared to system wide capacity  measured in asms  decreased by in as compared to reflecting a decrease in domestic asms and a decrease in international asms 
passenger traffic volume  as measured by total rpms in scheduled service  decreased in over passenger load factor for was compared to in twa s yield per passenger mile increased from cents in to cents in reflecting the company s efforts to improve productivity and reduce operating costs  operating expenses declined to  million in  million lower than the total operating expenses of  million for the year ended december   representing a net change in the following expense groups salaries  wages and benefits of  million for were million less than  primarily due to a decrease in the average number of employees 
the average number of employees declined to  in as compared to  in a reduction of the number of employees occurred in several areas  particularly those impacted by the reduction in flying or maintenance of older narrow and widebody aircraft 
earned stock compensation charges of million for and million for represent primarily the non cash compensation charge recorded to reflect the expense associated with the distribution of shares of stock on behalf of employees as part of the reorganization 
for a further discussion of future charges related to non cash compensation  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
aircraft fuel and oil expense of million for was million less than expenses of million for the year ended december  the decrease in expenses is primarily due to decreases in the price of fuel million and in gallons consumed million 
passenger sales commission expense of million for was million less than the expense of million in primarily related to the million decrease in twa passenger revenues 
other factors contributing to the decrease were a reduction in commission rates in october and a decrease in the percentage of commissionable sales resulting in decreases in commission expense of million and million  respectively 
aircraft maintenance materials and repairs expense of million in represented a decrease of million from million for the decrease was primarily the result of higher levels of scheduled maintenance in  including heavy maintenance  a decrease in flying hours in versus  addition of new aircraft and retirement of old aircraft from twa s fleet  and a decrease in contract repair work performed by the company for other air carriers and third parties 
the average age of twa s operating fleet decreased from years at december  to years at december  depreciation and amortization expense decreased million from million in to million in primarily represented by decreases in the provision for obsolescence million  depreciation of aircraft million and amortization of intangible assets million 
the decrease in obsolescence was significantly related to the retirement of l and b aircraft fleets and its replacement with newer aircraft fleets 
the decrease in aircraft depreciation was related to b  b and l fleets becoming fully depreciated partially offset by increased depreciation on b  b and dc fleets related to new aircraft acquisitions and aircraft modifications on the dc aircraft associated with noise compliance and aging aircraft 
the decrease in amortization of intangible assets was related to the write off of the carrying value of twa s new york to athens route authority as a result of twa s decision to discontinue unprofitable service to athens and the sale of three gates at newark international airport in early operating lease rentals of million for were million more than the total rentals of million for the increase was primarily due to an increase in the average number of aircraft under operating leases from in to in and higher lease rates attributed to the introduction of newer aircraft into the fleet 
passenger food and beverage expense of million in represented a decrease of million from million for the twelve months of the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the number of passengers boarded on international flights resulting from the reduction in international scheduled asms together with savings derived from changes and improved efficiencies in food and beverage service 
during the fourth quarter of  special charges of million were recorded in connection with the company s decision to modify its international route structure and related aircraft fleet plan 
the charges included a write off of the carrying value of twa s new york athens route authority million and international employee severance liabilities million related to the termination of service to athens and frankfurt 
the special charges also include a reduction in carrying value of twa s owned l and b fleets million and the related inventories million 
these charges were based upon management s estimate of the amounts to be realized upon the disposition of these assets when they are removed from service 
actual amounts could materially differ from such estimates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of these special charges 
all other operating expenses decreased million to million in from million during the year ended december  decreases were noted in the cost of services sold million  cost of services purchased million  advertising and publicity million  navigation charges million  landing fees million  subsidiary expenses million  uncollectible accounts million  taxes other than income million and numerous other miscellaneous categories 
these decreases were primarily related to twa s planned reductions in capacity reduction in system scheduled asms and maintenance performed for third parties 
other charges credits were a net charge of million for as compared to million for interest expense decreased million in over as a result of the reduction of debt arising from the restructuring and additional reductions of debt during and interest income decreased by million in primarily as a result of lower levels of invested funds 
dispositions of assets resulted in a net gain of million in  compared to a net loss of million in the net gain in included million from the sale of three gates at newark international airport and million from the sale of aircraft  engines and other property 
other charges and credits net were unfavorable by million in compared to  primarily due to a million decline in foreign currency translation adjustments  a million decrease in vendor discounts and a million credit in to reflect a litigation settlement 
the provision for income taxes in and related primarily to foreign taxes 
in future periods  the amortization of reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets and certain other non deductible items will likely result in the company s effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes exceeding statutory rates  notwithstanding the company s substantial net operating loss carryforwards 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the above  the operating loss of million for was million less than the operating loss of million for the net loss of million for was million less than the net loss of million for the operating and net losses for included special charges for nonrecurring items of million as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the net loss also included million in extraordinary charges related to the early extinguishment of debt while the net loss included million of such charges

aircraft fuel and oil expense of million for was million over the total expenses of million for this increase is primarily due to an increase in the price of fuel  an increase in gallons consumed and the expiration in october of the airlines exemption from paying fuel taxes of cents per gallon  which impacted fuel expense by approximately million 
passenger sales commission expense of million for was million higher than the combined expenses of million in  and is primarily related to the million increase in twa passenger revenues offset by an increase in non commissionable international tickets

liquidity and capital resources the following is a discussion of the impact of significant factors affecting twa s liquidity position and capital resources 
these comments should be read in conjunction with  and are qualified in their entirety by  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
liquidity the company s consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance at december  was million  a million increase from the december  balance of million 
this increase in the company s cash balances resulted primarily from the issuance of long term debt and sale of preferred stock as described below 
although the company s operational performance substantially improved during the second  third and fourth quarters of  the residual effects of difficulties experienced in continued throughout the first two quarters of and  to a lesser extent  during the third quarter of however  the company has taken various initiatives designed to improve the company s financial performance 
as a result  the company s financial performance for the final six months of was better than its performance in the final six months of in february  in order to improve its liquidity  the company entered into an agreement with and received approximately million from certain st 
louis business enterprises  representing the advance payment for tickets for future travel by such enterprises 
in march  the company raised approximately million in net proceeds from the issuance of  units  with each unit consisting of i one senior secured note due  in the principal amount of  and ii one redeemable warrant to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of approximately per share 
in december  the company raised net proceeds of million from the sale of the preferred stock  net proceeds of million from the sale of the notes  a portion of the proceeds of which was used to repay the reset notes  and net proceeds of million from the sale of the receivables securitization notes  a portion of the proceeds of which was used to repay the outstanding balance of the icahn loans 
the net increase in cash and cash equivalents during was due  in large part  to cash provided by financing activities of million in versus cash used by financing activities of million in sources of cash generated by financing activities related primarily to proceeds from long term debt  warrants and preferred stock sold of million in versus million in these proceeds were partially offset by the repayment of long term debt and capital lease obligations of million in versus million in  and the redemption of preferred stock in the amount of million 
cash provided by operating activities improved to million in from cash used by operating activities of million in this favorable change reflects a reduction in the net loss from million in to million in additionally  as an offset  net discounted sales from tickets sold under the karabu ticket agreement are excluded from cash provided by operating activities as the related amounts are applied as a reduction of the icahn loans and pbgc notes 
during  million of such proceeds had been applied as a reduction to the principal balance of the icahn loans and had been applied as a reduction to the pbgc notes 
during  the proceeds applied as reductions to the icahn loans and the pbgc notes were million and million  respectively 
additionally  million in cash was generated from an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses  primarily due to the timing of payments of certain obligations  and million in cash was generated from a decrease in receivables  offset by a related reduction of million in advanced ticket sales 
cash used by investing activities decreased to million in from million in components of this decrease include a decrease in capital expenditures including aircraft pre delivery payments to million in from million in  an increase in proceeds from the sale of assets to million in versus million in and the return of million in pre delivery deposits related to a new b aircraft which was purchased by a lessor and simultaneously leased back to twa 
gross proceeds from assets sold during included million for three gates at newark international airport and million from the sale of aircraft  engines and other surplus property and equipment 
the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents during as compared to was due  in large part  to the fact that cash used in operating activities in was million as compared to when cash provided by operating activities was million 
the adverse change was primarily attributable to the decrease in operating income as compared with additionally  as discussed above  net discounted sales from tickets sold under the karabu ticket agreement are excluded from cash provided by operating activities as the related amounts were applied as a million reduction of the icahn loans and a million reduction of the pbgc notes 
at december  approximately million of such proceeds had been applied to the principal balance of the icahn loans  while no proceeds had been applied to the pbgc notes 
the increase of million in trade accounts payable during was primarily due to the company utilizing a safe harbor provision with regard to payment of us transportation taxes of million for the period september through december  a significant portion of which was paid in february cash used in investing activities increased million from million in to million in a large part of this increase was related to capital expenditures million in versus million in which had been somewhat restricted by fiscal controls in place during most of financing activities used million of cash in  compared with a net use of cash of million in proceeds from long term debt issued and sale and leaseback transactions decreased from million in to million in repayments of long term debt and capital leases required million more cash in than in in  net proceeds from the sale of preferred stock were million while the early redemption of the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock and cash dividends required million and million  respectively 
in  the net proceeds from an equity rights offering generated million 
in march  the company completed the sale of million in senior notes due resulting in net proceeds to the company of million 
the company intends to use the net proceeds for certain capital expenditures  including pre delivery deposits on new aircraft acquisitions  and for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
in late  the company began implementing a series of new strategic initiatives designed to improve the company s financial and operating results 
the achievement of these improved operating results is subject to significant uncertainties  including the company s ability to achieve higher revenue yields and load factors  the cost of aircraft fuel  the company s ability to finance or lease suitable replacement aircraft at reasonable rates and the containment of operating costs 
no assurance can be given that any of the initiatives already implemented or any new initiatives  if implemented  will be successful  or if successful  that such initiatives will produce sufficient results for the company to be successful in generating the operating revenues and cash required for profitable operations or future viability 
pursuant to the reorganization  the company issued  ticket vouchers  each with a face value of  which may be used for up to a discount off the cost of a twa airline ticket for transportation on twa ticket vouchers 
pursuant to certain agreements  the company repurchased approximately  of the ticket vouchers at an aggregate cost of million 
payments in respect of these ticket vouchers were approximately million in and approximately million in concurrently  the company undertook aircraft lease payment deferrals to increase liquidity and improve the company s financial condition 
gross deferrals of lease and conditional sale indebtedness payments aggregated approximately million with a weighted average repayment period of approximately two years 
the aircraft lease payment deferrals contemplated by the reorganization generally anticipated six month deferrals with various payback periods  extending in some instances over the remaining life of the lease  and in other cases over a specified period 
cash repayments of lease deferrals  including interest  were approximately million in the fourth quarter of  million in  million in and are expected to approximate million in on june   the company signed an agreement the extension and consent agreement with karabu to extend the term of the icahn loans from january  to january  and to obtain the consent of karabu and the icahn entities to certain modifications to the pbgc notes 
collateral for the icahn loans included a number of aircraft  engines and related equipment  along with substantially all of the company s receivables 
on december  the company repaid the outstanding balance of the icahn loans with a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the receivables securitization notes 
on june   in consideration of  among other things  the extension of the icahn loans  twa and karabu entered into the ticket agreement  which permitted karabu to purchase two categories of discounted tickets domestic consolidator tickets  which are subject to a cap of million  based on the full retail price of the tickets million in the first months and million per year for seven consecutive years through the term of the ticket agreement  and system tickets  which are not subject to any cap throughout the term of the ticket agreement
