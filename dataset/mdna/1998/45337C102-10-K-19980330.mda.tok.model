when used in this discussion  the words expects  anticipates  estimates  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements  which include statements as to expected expenditure levels and the adequacy of capital resources  are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  those risks discussed below  as well as the extent of utilization of genomic information by the pharmaceutical industry in both research and development  risks relating to the development of new database products and their use by potential collaborators of the company  the impact of technological advances and competition  the ability of the company to obtain and retain customers  competition from other entities  early termination of a database collaboration agreement or failure to renew an agreement upon expiration  the ability to successfully integrate the operations of recent business combinations  the cost of accessing technologies developed by other companies  uncertainty as to the scope of coverage  enforceability or commercial protection from patents that issue on gene sequences and other genetic information  the viability of joint ventures and businesses in which the company has purchased equity  and the matters discussed in item under the caption business factors that may affect results 
these forward looking statements speak only as of the date hereof 
the company expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in the company s expectations with regard thereto or any change in events  conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based 
overview incyte pharmaceuticals  inc the company designs  develops and markets genomic database products  genomic data management software tools and related reagents and services 
the company s genomic databases integrate bioinformatics software with proprietary and  when appropriate  publicly available genetic information to create information based tools used by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in drug discovery and development 
in building the databases  the company utilizes high throughput  computer aided gene sequencing and analysis technologies to identify and characterize the expressed genes of the human genome  as well as certain animal  plant and microbial genomes 
in january  the company completed the acquisition of synteni  inc synteni  a microarray based gene expression company 
revenues recognized by the company are predominantly related to database collaboration agreements and consist primarily of non exclusive database access fees 
revenues also include sales of genomic screening products and services and fees for custom or satellite database services 
the company s database collaboration agreements provide for future milestone payments and royalties from the sale of products derived from proprietary information obtained through the databases 
there can be no assurance that any database collaborators will ever generate products from information contained within the databases and thus that the company will ever receive milestone payments or royalties 
while the company reported net income for  there can be no assurance that the company can maintain profitability 
the company s ability to maintain significant revenues will be dependent upon its ability to obtain additional database collaborators and retain existing collaborators 
the company s ability to maintain profitability will also be dependent upon the level of expenditures necessary for the company to maintain and support its services to its collaborators and the extent to which it incurs research and development  investment  acquisition related or other expenses related to the development and provision of its products and services to database collaborators 
further  the company s database collaboration agreements typically have a term of three years 
some of these agreements require the company to meet certain performance obligations 
these agreements may not be renewed upon expiration and a database collaboration agreement may be terminated earlier by a collaborator if the company breaches the agreement 
in addition  one database collaborator has the right on days written notice to terminate its database collaboration agreement 
there can be no assurance that any of the company s database collaboration agreements will be renewed upon expiration or not terminated earlier in accordance with its terms 
the loss of revenues from any database collaborator could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of a variety of factors including changes in the demand for the company s products and services  the pricing of database access to database collaborators  the nature  pricing and timing of other products and services provided to the company s collaborators  changes in the research and development budgets of the company s collaborators and potential collaborators  capital expenditures  acquisition and licensing costs and other costs related to the expansion of the company s operations  including operating losses of acquired businesses such as synteni  the introduction of competitive databases or services  and expenses related to  and results of  litigation 
in particular  the company has a limited ability to control the timing of database installations  there is a lengthy sales cycle required for the company s database products  the company s revenue levels are difficult to forecast  the time required to complete custom orders can vary significantly  and the company s increasing investments in external alliances could result in significant quarterly fluctuations in expenses due to the payment of milestones  license fees or research payments 
the company s investments in joint ventures and businesses  particularly diadexus  llc diadexus  a joint venture with smithkline beecham corporation sb  may require the company to record losses or expenses related to its proportionate ownership interest in such entities  to record charges for the acquisition of in process technologies  or to record charges for the recognition of the impairment in the value of the securities underlying such investments 
in addition  the company could incur substantial expenses in its defense of the lawsuit filed in january by affymetrix  inc affymetrix alleging patent infringement by synteni and incyte 
affymetrix seeks a permanent injunction enjoining synteni and incyte from further infringement and  in addition  seeks damages  costs  attorneys fees and interest 
affymetrix further requests that any such damages be trebled on its allegation of willful infringement by incyte and synteni 
incyte and synteni believe they have meritorious defenses and intend to defend the suit vigorously 
however  there can be no assurance that incyte and synteni will be successful in the defense of this suit  and litigation  regardless of the outcome  could result in substantial expenses and diversion of the efforts of management and technical personnel 
further  there can be no assurance that any license that may be required as a result of this suit or the outcome thereof would be made available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
the need for continued investment in development of the company s databases and related products and services and for extensive ongoing collaborator support capabilities results in significant fixed expenses 
if revenue in a particular period does not meet expectations  the company may not be able to adjust significantly its level of expenditures in such period  which would have an adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company may also experience difficulty in forecasting levels of operating expenditures for  and integration related expenses with respect to  subsidiaries acquired through acquisitions  at least until a substantial period of time has passed since the acquisition date 
this is particularly true when attempting to forecast expenditure levels for acquired businesses that focus on technologies for which there is not yet an established market 
the company believes that quarterly comparisons of its financial results will not necessarily be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
due to the foregoing and other unforeseen factors  it is likely that in some future quarter or quarters the company s operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
the company believes that quarterly comparisons of its financial results will not necessarily be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
as a result of computer programs being written using two digits  rather than four  the performance of the company s computer systems  and those of its suppliers and customers  in the year is uncertain 
any computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company plans to initiate a year project  using internal and external resources  to evaluate the impact of the year on its products and operating systems 
this will include the initiation of formalcommunications with its significant suppliers and customers to determine the extent to which the company s interface systems are vulnerable to third party failures to remediate their own year issues 
there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted and would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems 
the company will perform a comprehensive review of all internally used financial and administrative systems as well as the internally developed products sold to customers 
at this time  given that the company s internal financial and administrative systems have been installed within the last few years  and all internally developed software based products sold to customers have been developed over the last few years  the company does not expect the cost of addressing the year issue to have a material impact on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
however  there can be no guarantee that if modifications or replacement of portions of the software are necessary  it will be completed in a timely manner 
in july  the company issued common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of genome systems  inc genome systems  a genomics service company located in st 
louis  missouri 
the transaction has been accounted for as a pooling of interests  and the consolidated financial statements discussed herein and all historical financial information have been restated to reflect the combined operations of both companies 
in august  the company acquired for common stock combion  inc combion  a microarray technology company located in pasadena  california 
the acquisition of combion has been accounted for as a purchase  and the consolidated financial statements discussed herein include the results of combion from the date of acquisition  august   forward 
in september  the company formed a joint venture  diadexus  with sb  which will utilize genomic and bioinformatic technologies in the discovery and commercialization of molecular diagnostics 
the company and sb each hold a percent equity interest in diadexus 
the investment is accounted for under the equity method and the company will record its share of diadexus earnings and losses on its statement of operations 
in january  the company issued common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of synteni  a microarray based genomics company located in fremont  california 
the transaction will be accounted for as a pooling of interests in pro forma unaudited historical data summarizing the combined results of the company and synteni is set forth in note of notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this report 
as part of its business strategy  the company may from time to time acquire assets and businesses principally relating to  or complementary to  its operations 
these acquisitions  such as the acquisitions mentioned above  are accompanied by risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of companies 
these risks include  among other things  potential fluctuations in the company s quarterly and annual operating results as discussed above  the difficulty and expense of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses  the potential disruption of the company s ongoing business and diversion of management time and attention  the inability to successfully integrate or to complete the development and application of acquired technology and the potential failure to achieve anticipated financial  operating and strategic benefits from such acquisitions  and difficulties in establishing and maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies

the net loss per share in and reflects the issuance of million shares in in connection with the company s business combinations with genome systems and combion and the issuance of million shares in a november follow on public offering 
all share and per share data have been adjusted retroactively for a two for one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend paid on november  to holders of record on october  revenues 
revenues for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
revenues resulted primarily from database access fees and  to a much lesser extent  from custom satellite database services and genomic screening products and services 
the increase in revenues from year to year was predominantly driven by an increase in the number of database collaboration agreements 
expenses 
total costs and expenses for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
total costs and expenses for the year ended december  included a one time charge of million for the purchase of in process research and development relating to the acquisition of combion 
total costs and expenses are expected to increase in the foreseeable future due to continued investment in new product and technology development  obligations under existing and future research and development alliances  and increased investment in marketing  sales and customer services 
however  if the company does not obtain additional collaborators in a timely manner  if the company s database collaborators do not renew their collaboration agreement at the end of their applicable terms  or if the delivery of custom orders is delayed  the company may not be able to adjust significantly its level of expenditures in any period  which would have an adverse effect on the company s operating results 
research and development expenses for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses resulted primarily from an increase in bioinformatics and software development efforts  increased data and reagent production capacity  technology development initiatives  license and milestone payments under research and development alliances  and increased costs related to intellectual property protection

interest and other income  net for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
interest and other income  net increased as a result of increased interest income from higher average combined cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances 
losses from joint venture 
losses from joint ventures were million for the year ended december  the loss represents the company s share of diadexus losses from operations 
since diadexus was formed in september  no losses from joint ventures were recognized prior to the company expects that losses from joint ventures will increase in  accounting for a full year of expanding operations income taxes 
the estimated effective annual income tax rate for is  which represents the provision of federal and state alternative minimum taxes after utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
no provisions have been recorded prior to the fiscal year as the company incurred annual net operating losses 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  compared to million as of december  this increase was primarily due to net proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock in a july follow on public offering 
the company has classified all of its marketable securities as short term  as the company may not hold its marketable securities until maturity in order to take advantage of favorable market conditions 
available cash is invested in accordance with the company s investment policy s primary objectives of liquidity  safety of principal and diversity of investments 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  and net cash used by operating activities of million for the year ended december  the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in compared to resulted primarily from increases in deferred revenue due to the prepayment of database collaboration fees  the change from net loss to net income  and increased depreciation and amortization expenses partially offset by the increase in accounts receivable 
net cash provided by operating activities in as compared to a use of cash in resulted from increases in deferred revenue and accounts payable  and decreases in net loss and accounts receivable 
in the future  net cash generated by operating activities may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to the timing of large prepayments by database collaborators

capital expenditures for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures increased in and primarily due to investments in computer and laboratory equipment as well as leasehold improvements related to the expansion of the company s facilities 
the company has entered into a multi year lease with respect to a  square foot building to be constructed adjacent to the company s palo alto headquarters 
the company does not expect to incur expenses related to this facility until late or early long term investments in companies with which the company has research and development alliances increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  new investments in included equity investments in netgenics  inc and oncormed  inc in addition  million was categorized as restricted cash due to future obligations to diadexus pursuant to a joint venture agreement with sb entered into in in the future  net cash used by investing activities may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to the timing of strategic equity investments  capital expenditures and maturity sales and purchases of marketable securities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities in and was primarily due to proceeds from follow on public stock offerings in august and november  respectively  while net cash provided by financing activities in was due to issuances of common stock upon exercise of stock options 
based upon its current plans  the company believes that its existing resources and anticipated cash flow from operations will be adequate to satisfy its capital needs at least through however  the company may be unable to obtain additional collaborators or retain existing collaborators for the company s databases  and its database products and services may not produce revenues which  together with the company s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  would be adequate to fund the company s cash requirements 
the company s cash requirements depend on numerous factors  including the ability of the company to attract and retain collaborators for its databases and genomic products and services  expenditures in connection with alliances  license agreements and acquisitions of and investments in complementary technologies and businesses  competing technological and market developments  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the purchase of additional capital equipment  including capital equipment necessary to ensure the company s sequencing and microarray operations remain competitive  capital expenditures required to expand the company s and synteni s facilities  and costs associated with the integration of new operations assumed through mergers and acquisitions 
in particular  the company expects its cash requirements to increase in as it increases its investment in data processing related computer hardware in order to support its existing and new database products  continues to seek access to technologies through investments  alliances  license agreements  and or acquisitions  makes investments associated with integration of acquired companies  and addresses its needs for larger facilities and or improvements in existing facilities 
the company expects to continue to fund future operations with revenues from genomic database products and services in addition to using its current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
changes in the company s research and development plans or other changes affecting the company s operating expenses may result in changes in the timing and amount of expenditures of the company s capital resources 
if additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of these securities could result in dilution to the company s existing stockholders 
additional funding  if necessary  may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds through entering into collaborative arrangements that may require the company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies  product candidates  products or potential markets
