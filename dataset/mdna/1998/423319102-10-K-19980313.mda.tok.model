sales decreased in the fourth quarter due to uncertainty in the asian market 
total gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in compared with in the increase in gross profit was principally due to efficiencies derived from the company s flexible manufacturing strategies and ongoing cost reduction initiatives 
research and development expenses increased to million or of net sales for fiscal as compared to million or of net sales for the prior fiscal period 
this increase reflects continued funding by the company of long term strategic development programs in response to the increasing demand for new products and product enhancements from the semiconductor industry 
part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million or of net sales for fiscal as compared to million or of net sales for the prior fiscal year 
this increase is primarily due to increases in salaries and variable compensation expense  and to increased sales and marketing efforts worldwide

part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued total gross profit as a percentage of net sales improved percentage points during compared with the increase in gross margin was principally due to efficiencies derived from the company s manufacturing competencies 
as a result of the company s flexible manufacturing strategy  gross margins remained strong at the low revenue levels of the second half of the company s investment in research and development increased in compared with incorporation of our on board technology in a full range of vacuum components will allow us to offer a broader range of products to our current market 
the company has been developing unique vacuum solutions for customers who are moving to larger wafer sizes and finer geometries in next generation semiconductors 
the company continues to fund long term strategic development programs despite short term market conditions 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increases in selling costs and was somewhat offset by performance based management compensation expense
