average net sales per gross square foot for fiscal has been calculated on the basis of a fifty two week fiscal year 
net sales for purposes of the above calculations are comprised of net sales generated from computer superstores  as well as the company s national accounts group  but exclude mail order sales 
comparable store sales are net sales for computer superstores open the same number of months in both the indicated and previous period  including stores that were relocated or expanded during either period 
the comparable store sales increase for fiscal has been calculated by comparing net sales for the fifty two weeks ended june  with net sales for the fifty two weeks ended june  the comparable store sales increase for fiscal has been calculated by comparing net sales for the fifty three weeks ended june  with net sales for the fifty three weeks ended july  average net sales per gross square foot declined during fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to reductions in average net sales per computer superstore 
in fiscal  average net sales per computer superstore decreased approximately from fiscal average net sales per computer superstore were negatively impacted by declines in average selling prices of certain of the company s products and increased sales of lower end computer systems 
additionally  in fiscal  net sales of stores open less than two years comprised a higher proportion of the company s total net sales than in fiscal less mature stores typically have lower net sales per gross square foot than more mature stores 
in addition  management believes net sales have decreased at certain stores when the company has opened additional stores in the same market 
the comparable store sales increase declined in fiscal compared with fiscal due to the reasons noted above 
in addition  the company believes the opening of additional computer superstores in existing markets has resulted in some reductions in the rate of comparable store sales growth 
compusa has opened additional stores in existing markets largely to increase market penetration and to provide customers with more convenience and better service 
the company plans to continue its strategy of opening additional computer superstores in existing markets 
management believes the resulting diversion of sales from existing stores has adversely affected the company s comparable store sales 
however  the company believes that this strategy should increase its awareness with local consumers  enhance its competitive position in such markets  and create efficiencies in advertising and management  and therefore is in the company s long term best interest 
acquisition of computer city on august   the company completed its acquisition of computer city from tandy corporation for million  payable in a note and cash 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the purchase price is subject to certain post closing adjustments based on the completion of an audit of computer city s balance sheet as of the closing date 
the acquisition will be accounted for under the purchase accounting method 
the computer city stores that the company currently intends to close are generally in closer proximity to  and therefore the company believes would have been more directly competitive with  existing compusa computer superstores than the computer city stores in the united states that will remain open as compusa computer superstores 
of the stores that will remain open  are located in metropolitan areas in which there are existing compusa computer superstores 
the company believes its decision to continue to operate these stores is consistent with its strategy of opening additional computer superstores in existing markets to increase market penetration and to provide customers with more convenience and better service 
however  the continued operation of these stores may cause the rate of comparable store sales growth in the compusa computer superstores already in operation in such metropolitan areas to be lower than it would have been if these stores had been closed 
results of operations as a result of the expansion of the company s store base  period to period comparisons of financial results may not be meaningful and the results of operations for historical periods may not be indicative of the results to be expected in future periods 
in addition  the company expects that its quarterly results of operations will fluctuate depending on the timing of the opening of  and the amount of net sales contributed by  new stores and the timing of costs associated with the selection  leasing  construction  and opening of new stores  as well as seasonal factors  product introductions  and changes in product mix

year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
the company s computer equipment and software and devices with imbedded technology that are time sensitive may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has undertaken various initiatives intended to ensure that its computer equipment and software will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
for this purpose  the term computer equipment and software includes systems that are commonly thought of as it systems  including accounting  data processing  and telephone pbx systems  cash registers  hand held terminals  scanning equipment  and other miscellaneous systems  as well as systems that are not commonly thought of as it systems  such as alarm systems  fax machines  or other miscellaneous systems 
both it and non it systems may contain imbedded technology  which complicates the company s year identification  assessment  remediation  and testing efforts 
based upon its identification and assessment efforts to date  the company believes that certain of the computer equipment and software it currently uses will require replacement or modification 
in addition  in the ordinary course of replacing computer equipment and software  the company attempts to obtain replacements that are year compliant 
utilizing both internal and external resources to identify and assess needed year remediation  the company currently anticipates that its year identification  assessment  remediation and testing efforts  which began in october  will be completed by june   and that such efforts will be completed prior to any currently anticipated impact on its computer equipment and software 
the company estimates that as of september   it had completed approximately of the initiatives that it believes will be necessary to fully address potential year issues relating to its computer equipment and software 
the projects comprising the remaining of the initiatives are in process and expected to be completed on or about june  percent year initiative time frame complete initial it system identification and assessment remediation and testing regarding central system issues remediation and testing regarding departmental system issues remediation and testing regarding store and distribution system issues upgrades to telephone pbx and other systems electronic data interchange trading partner conversions identification  assessment  remediation and testing regarding desktop and individual system issues identification and assessment regarding non it system issues remediation and testing regarding non it system issues the company has also mailed letters to its significant vendors and service providers and has verbally communicated with many strategic customers to determine the extent to which interfaces with such entities are vulnerable to year issues and whether the products and services purchased from or by such entities are year compliant 
as of september   the company had received responses from approximately of such third parties  and of the companies that have responded have provided written assurances that they expect to address all their significant year issues on a timely basis 
a follow up mailing to significant vendors and service providers that did not initially respond  or whose responses were deemed unsatisfactory by the company  has been completed  with responses due by october  the company believes that the cost of its year identification  assessment  remediation and testing efforts  as well as currently anticipated costs to be incurred by the company with respect to year issues of third parties  will not exceed million  which expenditures will be funded from operating cash flows 
such amount represents approximately of the company s total actual and anticipated it expenditures for fiscal through fiscal as of june   the company had incurred costs of approximately million related to its year identification  assessment  remediation and testing efforts 
all of the million relates to analysis  repair or replacement of existing software  upgrades of existing software  or evaluation of information received from significant vendors  service providers  or customers 
other non year it efforts have not been materially delayed or impacted by year initiatives 
the company presently believes that the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for the company 
however  if all year issues are not properly identified  or assessment  remediation and testing are not effected timely with respect to year problems that are identified  there can be no assurance that the year issue will not materially adversely impact the company s results of operations or adversely affect the company s relationships with customers  vendors  or others 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the year issues of other entities will not have a material adverse impact on the company s systems or results of operations 
the company has begun  but not yet completed  a comprehensive analysis of the operational problems and costs including loss of revenues that would be reasonably likely to result from the failure by the company and certain third parties to complete efforts necessary to achieve year compliance on a timely basis 
a contingency plan has not been developed for dealing with the most reasonably likely worst case scenario  and such scenario has not yet been clearly identified 
the company currently plans to complete such analysis and contingency planning by december  the company has engaged an independent expert to evaluate its year identification  assessment  remediation and testing efforts 
the costs of the company s year identification  assessment  remediation and testing efforts and the dates on which the company believes it will complete such efforts are based upon management s best estimates  which were derived using numerous assumptions regarding future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party remediation plans  and other factors 
there can be no assurance that these estimates will prove to be accurate  and actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated 
specific factors that could cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in year issues  the ability to identify  assess  remediate and test all relevant computer codes and embedded technology  and similar uncertainties 
in addition  variability of definitions of compliance with year and the myriad of different products and services  and combinations thereof  sold by the company may lead to claims whose impact on the company is not currently estimable 
no assurance can be given that the aggregate cost of defending and resolving such claims  if any  will not materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
although some of the company s agreements with manufacturers and others from whom it purchases products for resale contain provisions requiring such parties to indemnify the company under some circumstances  there can be no assurance that such indemnification arrangements will cover all of the company s liabilities and costs related to claims by third parties related to the year issue

in addition  the company s credit agreement provides for borrowings which bear interest at variable rates based on either a prime rate or the london interbank offering rate 
the company had no borrowings outstanding pursuant to the credit agreement in fiscal the company believes that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on the company s financial position  results of operations  and cash flows should not be material
