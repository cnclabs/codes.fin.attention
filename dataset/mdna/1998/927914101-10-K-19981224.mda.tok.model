the following table sets forth statement of income data as a percentage of revenues for the fiscal years indicated 
fiscal year ended september  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative acquired technology and merger expenses total operating expenses operating income interest and other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income revenues revenues include fees from the license of software products  maintenance and support contracts  net of reserves for estimated future returns and allowances 
license revenues are derived from packaged software products  volume licenses and certain oem arrangements 
the company periodically upgrades its products 
revenues from upgrades are cyclical and are typically highest in the periods of and immediately following an upgrade 
the last significant upgrade occurred in august when visio standard  visio technical and visio professional were upgraded to version included in upgrade revenues are revenues from cross grades whereby customers purchase upgrades to move from one visio product to another 
the company s average selling price per unit is typically higher on sales of new units of packaged products than sales of upgrades  volume licenses or oem arrangements 
of the company s primary products  visio professional  visio technical  intellicad and visio enterprise have higher average selling prices than visio standard 
volume discounts are generally granted on products sold through the volume licensing channel 
the increase in revenues for the three fiscal years ended september  was due primarily to sales volume growth across product groups  distribution channels and geographic regions as well as an aggregate increase in average selling price due to the change in product mix toward the higher priced products 
the company anticipates increasing the selling prices for most of its major products in fiscal however  the company cannot predict how such price increases will affect total revenues due to potential changes in sales volume and continued fluctuations in aggregate average selling prices from shifts in product  channel and geography mix 
contributing most significantly to the growth in revenues in fiscal and fiscal was the release of visio professional in january product groups the following table sets forth revenues by product group with the corresponding percentage of total revenues and the year to year percentage growth for the fiscal periods indicated 
fiscal year ended september  total total growth total growth in thousands revenues business diagramming    technical drawing    it design and documentation  n a  total revenues    the company classifies its products into the following product groups visio standard  visio business modeler and visio maps in the business diagramming product group  visio technical and intellicad in the technical drawing product group  and visio professional and visio network equipment in the it design and documentation product group 
in early fiscal  the company introduced visio enterprise that will be classified in the it design and documentation product group 
the increase in business diagramming product revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal was attributable to an increase in the volume of new licenses  offset by a decrease in upgrade revenues as well as a decrease in average selling prices due to an increase in the percentage of product sold through the volume licensing channel 
the increase in business diagramming product revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal was attributable to an increase in upgrade revenues due to the version upgrade released in august revenues from new licenses were flat in fiscal compared to fiscal the company believes that in fiscal and the percentage growth in the business diagramming product group was impacted by cannibalization from visio professional to the extent that customers such as it professionals who may otherwise have purchased visio standard chose visio professional instead for its added features and content 
the increase in technical drawing product revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal was attributable to an increase in new license volume and upgrade volume  offset by a decline in average selling prices due to the increase in the percentage of product sold through the volume licensing channel 
the increase in technical drawing product revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal was attributable to an increase in new license volume  upgrade volume and the release of intellicad in march average selling prices for technical drawing products in fiscal were up slightly from fiscal due to a higher percentage of revenues attributable to new licenses rather than upgrades  offset by a higher percentage of revenues sold through the volume licensing channel 
the company believes that in fiscal and the percentage growth in the technical drawing product group was also impacted by cannibalization from visio professional 
prior to the release of visio professional  visio technical was marketed to it professionals as a solution for network diagramming 
visio professional  the company s first significant product in the it design and documentation product group  significantly impacted the revenue mix within the product groups 
since visio professional was introduced in the second quarter of fiscal  sales of that product have grown as the product has been accepted as a viable solution for it professionals in the design and documentation of their networks  databases  software applications and web sites 
also contributing to the growth of visio professional has been the growth of the it design and documentation market as a whole 
the revenue growth of the it design and documentation product group was slightly offset by decreases in average selling prices due to the increase in the percentage of products sold through the volume licensing channel 
sales channels the following table sets forth revenues by sales channel with the corresponding percentage of total revenues and the year to year percentage growth for the fiscal periods indicated 
fiscal year ended september  total total growth total growth in thousands revenues distribution    direct    volume licensing    oem  total revenues    visio classifies its revenues into four sales channels distribution  direct  volume licensing  and oem 
distribution revenues represent sales of packaged products through national distributors and corporate  value added  retail and mail order resellers 
direct revenues represent sales of packaged products directly by the company generally to end users responding to advertising or marketing promotions 
volume licensing revenues are derived from volume licenses which are generally administered through corporate resellers after the company s sales staff has negotiated the sale 
the sales cycle for a volume license can extend up to eighteen months on significant volume licenses as organizations can require extensive time to evaluate and consider a large scale implementation 
volume licensing revenues usually do not include any significant amount of packaged goods  but do include maintenance and support revenues which are priced separately and recognized over the terms of the contracts 
oem revenues include licenses of visio products to hardware and software manufacturers for bundling arrangements 
oem revenues include packaged product sales  as well as royalty payments with no associated product costs 
growth during each of fiscal and in both the distribution and direct channels was primarily driven by the growth of the it design and documentation product group revenues as well as revenues from the version upgrade in august the strong growth in volume licensing reflects continued investment in the corporate sales force and the volume licensing programs 
the company increased its corporate sales staff from at september  to at september  the company expects to hire additional corporate sales staff in fiscal and therefore expects revenues from volume licensing to continue to increase as a percentage of total revenues 
geography the following table sets forth revenues by geography with the corresponding percentage of total revenues and the year to year percentage growth for the fiscal periods indicated 
fiscal year ended september  total total growth total growth in thousands revenues north america    europe    rest of world    total revenues    the increase in europe and rest of world revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the release of visio professional and continued growth of visio technical in these geographies 
the decrease in europe revenues as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to the strong performance of visio professional in the united states and a lower growth rate in europe due to weaknesses in certain european markets 
the increase in europe and rest of world revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to the growth of the it design and documentation product group  the upgrade to version and the increase in volume licensing 
in addition  continued investment in international markets  including localized products  sales offices and staffing  also contributed to the growth of international revenues 
the growth in rest of world in fiscal compared to fiscal was partially offset by general weakened economic conditions and foreign currency devaluations in japan and southeast asia 
these economic and currency conditions may continue to negatively impact revenues and operating results in the rest of world region in upcoming periods 
the company s operating results are affected by foreign exchange rates 
approximately  and of the company s revenues were collected in foreign currencies during fiscal  and  respectively 
the impact on operating income due to exchange rate fluctuation is partially mitigated as most of the company s international production costs and operating expenses are incurred in foreign currencies as well 
therefore  the net impact of exchange rate fluctuations on income from operations is less than the impact on revenues 
cost of revenues fiscal year ended september  change change in thousands cost of revenues    percentage of revenues cost of revenues varies with the mix of distribution  direct  volume licensing and oem revenues and with relative variations in the standard product costs associated with each product group  and fluctuations in period costs 
standard product costs consist primarily of documentation  packaging  media duplication  assembly and material management costs 
period costs consist primarily of certain royalties  technical support  production management  freight and fulfillment  amortization of capitalized technology  standard material variances and inventory valuation adjustments 
standard costs associated with each product group are primarily determined by the amount of packaged product delivered in that product group 
accordingly  most of the company s standard costs are associated with distribution and direct revenues  the majority of which are derived from sales of packaged products 
volume licensing revenues have the lowest standard cost because they generally do not include any substantial amount of packaged goods 
the decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in each of fiscal and primarily resulted from increased use of lower cost cd rom media and other raw material cost reductions  an increase in the percentage of revenues from the technical drawing and it design and documentation product groups which generally have lower standard product costs as a percentage of revenues than the business diagramming products  and increased volume licensing revenues which have little or no standard product costs 
these decreases were partially offset by increased royalty costs for licensed technology including visual basic for applications from microsoft corporation and increased amortization costs of capitalized technology 
the company believes its cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues may increase in the future due to expected increases in support for future products of more complexity and increased amortization of capitalized technology from recent acquisitions 
see acquired technology and merger expenses 
research and development fiscal year ended september  change change in thousands research and development    percentage of revenues research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel  contract services  occupancy and equipment costs required to conduct the company s product development efforts 
product development includes product engineering  documentation development  localization  usability testing  quality assurance and advanced research and development costs 
product localization costs and lump sum payments for technology are capitalized and amortized to development generally over the lesser of the useful life or months 
research and development expenses are charged to operations as incurred 
the company has not capitalized certain software development costs subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility  as these costs have not been material 
research and development expenses for each of fiscal and increased primarily due to planned hiring in the company s development organization and staffing additions associated with the acquisition of certain technology and assets from third parties 
see acquired technology and merger expenses 
the company believes it will be necessary to continue to increase research and development spending on an absolute basis during fiscal and beyond to expand its product lines and introduce new language version product to international markets 
sales and marketing fiscal year ended september  change change in thousands sales and marketing    percentage of revenues sales and marketing expenses have increased each fiscal year as the company continues building its worldwide sales  marketing and customer service infrastructure 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses in absolute terms and as a percentage of revenues for each of fiscal and was primarily due to expansion in international markets  increased product marketing costs to introduce and support new products and product upgrades and investment in the corporate sales force and the volume licensing programs 
the company believes substantial spending on marketing awareness and corporate sales staffing is essential to achieve revenue growth and to maintain and enhance the company s competitive position 
accordingly  visio expects sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute terms over time 
general and administrative fiscal year ended september  change change in thousands general and administrative    percentage of revenues general and administrative expenses increased in each of fiscal and in absolute terms primarily due to increased staffing and new information technology systems to support the company s growth as well as the establishment and growth of visio s international operations 
the company expects general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute terms in future periods as the company continues to develop a sufficient infrastructure to support its revenue growth 
acquired technology and merger expenses for all acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method  assets are recorded at fair market value 
the allocation of the purchase price to acquired technology or capitalized technology is based on known valuation techniques in the software industry 
for some transactions  the company obtains an independent appraisal of the technology 
amounts allocated to acquired technology relate to in process research and development that were immediately expensed in the period of acquisition because technological feasibility was not established and no alternative commercial use was identified 
amounts allocated to capitalized technology relate to technology that had achieved technological feasibility at the time of acquisition 
capitalized technology is amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the technology

accordingly  the financial statements include the combined results of operations for visio and kaspia  and all prior financial statements have been restated 
the transaction resulted in approximately million in merger related costs in fiscal see note of notes to the financial statements in item for additional information on the above business combinations 
interest and other income  net interest income was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in each of fiscal and was primarily due to larger cash and short term investment balances 
other income includes grant income from the industrial development agency of ireland and foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
the company conducts business in various foreign currencies and is therefore subject to transaction exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate movements between the dates that foreign currency transactions are recorded and the dates that they are settled 
in fiscal  visio began hedging certain foreign exchange transaction exposures through the use of forward exchange contracts 
to the extent the company has assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are not hedged  the company is subject to foreign currency gains and losses 
at september  and  approximately  and million  respectively  of forward exchange contracts were outstanding with maturities not exceeding days 
the net asset of forward exchange contracts was approximately  and  at september  and  respectively 
there have been no significant foreign currency transaction gains or losses to date with respect to these activities  however  there can be no assurance that the company s strategies will continue to be effective or that transaction gains or losses can be minimized or forecasted accurately 
the company does not hedge its translation risk 
income taxes the company s effective income tax rate was  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the statutory tax rate in the us was for fiscal and and for fiscal the effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rates for the respective years  and the decline in the effective tax rate in fiscal and was primarily due to increases each year in the percentage of income taxed in foreign jurisdictions at rates lower than in the us  increases in tax exempt interest income  increases in research and development credits and tax benefits from the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards obtained in the acquisition of certain technology and assets of infomodelers and the merger with kaspia in fiscal offsetting the decrease in effective tax rate in fiscal was the tax effect of non deductible acquired technology and merger expenses 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash and short term investments totaled million at september  compared to million at september  the investment portfolio consisted of high quality fixed income securities and government issues 
the increase in cash and short term investments for fiscal and was due primarily to cash generated from operations and cash proceeds from the issuance of shares through the employee stock option and stock purchase programs 
the increase in cash and short term investments was partially offset by purchases of equipment  leasehold improvements and capitalized technology  the payoff of the note payable issued in the acquisition of sysdraw and the payoff of the company s lines of credit 
the increase in cash and short term investments in fiscal was also partially offset by the increase in accounts receivable at september  this was due to a larger percentage of revenues being generated later in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the same period in fiscal in addition  receivables have grown due to the mix of revenues from international markets growing from in to in payment cycles are generally longer in international regions than domestically 
the company believes the percentage of revenues from international regions will continue to grow and thus expects that accounts receivable will grow  over time  faster than normal revenue growth would indicate 
the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  each of which could adversely affect the value of the company s investments 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the company maintains a short term investment portfolio consisting of interest bearing securities with an average maturity of less than one year 
these securities are classified as available for sale securities 
the interest bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at september   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
because the company has the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity  it does not expect its operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on its securities portfolio 
the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain balance sheet exposures against future movement in foreign exchange rates 
gains and losses on the forward contracts are largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying exposure 
a hypothetical appreciation or depreciation of each of the denominated foreign currencies from september  market rates would impact the unrealized value of the company s forward contracts by plus or minus  these gains or losses on the forward contracts are largely offset by the gains and losses on the underlying transactions and  consequently  the company does not expect that a sudden or significant change in foreign exchange rates would have a material impact on future net income or cash flows 
to the extent the company has assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are not hedged  the company is subject to foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
the company does not hedge its translation risk 
at september   the company s principal commitments consisted primarily of leases on its facilities 
the company s capital expenditures of million in fiscal included the purchase of a year compliant enterprisewide business software system 
the company s capital expenditures of million in fiscal included the purchase of furniture and fixtures  leasehold improvements and computer equipment associated with the increase in the company s staffing level 
in february  the company expects to relocate its seattle  washington operations to a new leased facility 
at september   the company had commitments for capital expenditures of approximately million related to facility expansion 
subsequent to september   the company entered into a lease for a new facility in dublin  ireland 
the company also exercised an option for additional space in connection with its new facility in seattle 
the company believes that its current cash balances  short term investments and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
from time to time  the company evaluates potential acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies that complement the company s business 
in fiscal the company paid a combined million related to the acquisition of technology and other assets from boomerang and sysdraw 
in addition  the company issued a million note payable to sysdraw  which note was paid in fiscal  and agreed to pay contingent consideration of million based on the achievement of certain performance goals within three years of the acquisition date 
in fiscal the company paid a combined million related to the acquisition of certain technology from decision graphics and ketiv 
at september   the company had no other material agreements or commitments with respect to any such transactions 
year issues the calendar year has the potential to cause problems in computer systems that record years using only the last two digits of the year 
for example  such systems record as  and as this method of dating can introduce problems in date calculation so that systems that rely on two digit date identifiers may not work as expected after december  or when handling dates after december  the year issue creates risks for the company from unforeseen problems in its own products or systems or in the systems of third parties from whom the company obtains products or services or with whom the company otherwise transacts business 
in fiscal the company replaced its worldwide accounting finance  manufacturing  sales and distribution systems with a year compliant enterprisewide business software system  and in fiscal the company extended the application of such enterprisewide software to its human resources systems 
by mid  the company intends to replace its worldwide customer management systems with a system that has been certified as year compliant 
in addition  the company has established cross functional teams to identify and resolve the company s year issues 
the primary functions of these teams include a conducting audits of the company s main internal systems  including telecommunications and all material software and hardware in the company s desktop environments  b implementing any necessary plans to correct deficiencies in such internal systems  c communicating with certain key parties with whom the company conducts business regarding the year readiness of such parties systems and d coordinating the testing of the company s products to determine the year readiness of those products 
internal systems the company has completed the audit of its telecommunication systems and expects to complete the audits of its other internal systems by march  the company intends to complete any required corrective actions identified in such audits by september  although the company does not believe that it will incur any material costs or experience material disruptions in its business associated with preparing its internal systems for the year  there can be no assurances that the company will not experience serious unanticipated negative consequences or material costs caused by undetected errors or defects in the technology used in its internal systems  which are composed of third party software  third party hardware that contains embedded software and the company s own software 
the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios would include corruption of data contained in the company s internal information systems  hardware failure  and the failure of infrastructure services provided by government agencies and other third parties eg  electricity  phone service  water transport  internet services  etc the company intends to prepare contingency plans for such events by september  the company expects its contingency plans to include  among other things  manual work arounds for software and hardware failures  as well as substitution of systems  if necessary 
vendors and service providers in september  the company began distributing detailed questionnaires to key vendors and service providers to determine the year status of their systems 
approximately one half of those questionnaires have been returned 
though the company expects to receive additional questionnaires throughout  there can be no assurance that all of the contacted third parties will respond 
to date  no material year risks have been identified during the company s communications with its key vendors and service providers 
to the extent the company identifies such risks  the company will work with the appropriate third parties to mitigate such risks 
however  the disruption or failure at or after the year of the systems of key vendors or service providers  as well as the failure of any contingency plans  remains a possibility and could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
company products with respect to its own products  the company is continuing to conduct quality and testing practices regarding the year transition 
current information about the year status of the company s products is available on the company s web site at www 
visio 
com yrhtml 
the company believes its current products  with any applicable updates  are well prepared for year issues 
however  there can be no guarantee that one or more current company products do not contain year deficiencies that may result in material costs to the company 
in particular  versions of the company s products that are not the most currently released or that are not currently being developed may not be year compliant 
because it is in the business of selling software products  the company s risk of being subjected to lawsuits relating to year issues is likely to be greater than that of companies in other industries 
because computer systems may include different hardware  firmware and software components from different manufacturers  it may be difficult to determine which component in a computer system may cause a year issue 
as a result  the company may be subjected to year related lawsuits independent of whether its products and services are year compliant 
the outcomes of any such lawsuits and the impact on the company cannot be predicted at this time 
the company does not expect total costs associated with becoming year compliant to be material to its financial position or results of operations 
to date  the cost of the year project has been approximately  and the total cost of the project is anticipated to be approximately  these amounts do not include the cost of the enterprisewide business software implemented in fiscal or the anticipated cost of the company s new customer management system 
european monetary union within europe  the european economic and monetary union the emu will introduce a new currency  the euro  on january  the new currency is in response to the emu s policy of economic convergence to harmonize trade policy  eliminate business costs associated with currency exchange and to promote the free flow of capital  goods and services 
on january   the participating countries are scheduled to adopt the euro as their local currency  initially available only for currency trading on currency exchanges and non cash banking transactions 
the existing local currencies  or legacy currencies  will remain legal tender through january  beginning on january   euro denominated bills and coins will be issued for cash transactions 
for a period of six months from this date  both legacy currencies and the euro will be legal tender 
on or before july   the participating countries will withdraw all legacy currency and use exclusively the euro 
the company has recognized the introduction of the euro as a significant event with potential implications for existing operations 
currently  participating countries in the emu where the company operates include ireland  germany  france  italy  spain and the netherlands 
the company expects non participating european union countries  such as the united kingdom  to eventually join the emu 
the company has committed resources to conduct risk assessments and to take corrective actions  where required  to ensure the company is prepared for the introduction of the euro 
the company has undertaken a review of the euro implementation and has concentrated on areas such as operations  finance  treasury  legal information management  procurement and others  both in participating and non participating european union countries where the company operates 
also  a review of existing legacy accounting and business systems and other business assets have been reviewed for euro compliance  including assessing any risks from third parties 
progress regarding euro implementation is reported periodically to management 
because of the staggered introduction of the euro regarding non cash and cash transactions  the company has developed its plans to address first its accounting and business systems and then its business assets 
the company expects to be euro compliant within its accounting and business systems by december and compliant within its other business assets prior to the introduction of the euro bills and coins 
compliance in participating and non participating countries will be achieved primarily through upgraded systems in cases where existing systems were already planned to be upgraded 
remaining systems for which there is no planned upgrade will be modified to achieve compliance 
the company does not currently expect to experience any significant operational disruptions or to incur any significant costs  including any currency risk  which could materially affect the company s liquidity or capital resources 
the company is preparing plans to address issues within the transitional period when both legacy and euro currencies may be tendered 
the company does not anticipate any long term competitive implications or the need to materially change its mode of conducting business as a result of increased transparency of pricing when sales in various countries are all denominated in the euro rather than in different currencies 
to the extent the company is unable  within the necessary timeframe  to complete any upgrades or modifications to its systems or business assets that are required to support euro transactions  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the company faces risks to the extent that key vendors and service providers are unable to make appropriate modifications to support euro transactions

certain risk factors that may impact future results of operations except for the historical information contained in this annual report on form k  the matters discussed herein  particularly those identified with the words expects  believes  anticipates and similar expressions  are forward looking statements 
these statements reflect management s best judgment based on factors known to them at the time of such statements 
such forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  including without limitation those set forth below  which risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
the factors set forth below  many of which are beyond the company s control  should be carefully considered when evaluating the company s business and prospects and the forward looking information provided by visio pursuant to the safe harbor provisions established by recent securities legislation

fluctuations in quarterly performance 
the company s quarterly results of operations can be affected substantially by demand for the company s products  the timing and customer acceptance of new products  product enhancements and promotions by the company or its competitors  product returns  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  the impact of acquisitions of other technologies or companies and changes in economic conditions 
the company is increasingly focusing its sales efforts on volume licensing to large accounts 
the timing of those licenses could significantly affect quarterly results of operations 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  and planned expenditures are based on the company s estimates for quarterly revenues 
as a result  variations in timing of revenues can cause significant variations in quarterly results of operations 
in general  the company has experienced the strongest demand for its software products during the december quarter and the weakest demand in the june and september quarters 
these seasonal patterns have been overshadowed in particular quarters by the timing of new product introductions  expansion into international markets  the execution of volume licenses and other factors affecting the company s business 
dependence on microsoft windows  relationship with microsoft 
substantially all of the company s revenues are derived from sales of products that are designed to work within a microsoft windows environment and are marketed primarily to windows users 
as a result  sales of the company s products would be materially affected by market developments adverse to windows based products 
as a developer of products for windows  the company has historically enjoyed a collaborative working relationship with microsoft 
if the relationship were disrupted for any reason  such as a decision by microsoft to introduce or acquire products that compete directly with the company s products  the company s development efforts and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
competition 
the computer software drawing and diagramming markets are intensely competitive and subject to rapidly changing technology and evolving standards 
the software industry has limited barriers to entry  and the availability of personal computers with continuously expanding capabilities  at progressively lower prices  contributes to the ease of market entry 
because of this and other factors  competitive conditions in the future are likely to intensify 
the markets for the company s products are characterized by significant price competition  and the company expects it will face increasing pricing pressures 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced profit margins and loss of market share  which could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
substantial dependence on a single technology  limited product line 
the company has derived substantially all of its revenues to date from sales of drawing and diagramming products based on its core technology 
the visio product line and related enhancements are expected to continue to account for a significant percentage of the company s revenues for the foreseeable future 
a decline in demand for these products as a result of competition  technological change or any other reason would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
rapid technological change and new product development 
the markets for the company s products are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  changes in customer needs and frequent new product introductions 
the company s future success will depend on its ability to enhance its current products  to develop new products that meet changing customer needs on a timely and cost effective basis and to respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
any failure by the company to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology and customer preferences  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
new product introductions 
the company periodically introduces new products and upgrades its current products in order to meet changing customer needs and anticipated market demand 
due to potential difficulties in the development process  there can be no assurance that such future products and upgrades will be released in a timely manner or that they will receive market acceptance  if and when released 
despite significant testing by the company and by current and potential customers  errors or bugs may still be found in new products or upgrades after commencement of commercial shipments 
delays in the commencement of commercial shipments of new products or upgrades  as well as the discovery of errors or bugs after release  may result in adverse publicity  customer dissatisfaction and delay or loss of product revenues 
furthermore  from time to time the company and others may announce new products  capabilities or technologies that have the potential to replace or shorten the life cycles of the company s existing products 
there can be no assurance that announcements of currently planned or other new products by the company  by microsoft or by the company s competitors will not cause customers to defer purchasing existing company products or cause distributors to return products to the company 
delays or difficulties associated with new product introductions or upgrades could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
management of growth and future acquisitions  risks associated with lease commitments 
the company has recently experienced rapid growth that has placed  and will continue to place  a significant strain on its management and operations 
the company s ability to manage its growth effectively will require it to improve its operating  financial and management information systems and to attract  train  motivate  manage and retain key employees 
furthermore  the company intends to enter into strategic relationships and make strategic acquisitions of technologies and businesses in order to expand its product lines and the capabilities of its current products 
the risks associated with acquisitions  including increased costs and uncertain benefits and the ability to integrate operations of acquired companies  could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
in addition  the company has committed to significant expansions of its corporate headquarters in seattle  washington and the headquarters of its international operations in dublin  ireland 
if the company s business does not grow at rates currently anticipated by management  the company may be unable to cost effectively utilize or sublease the new space  and the company s results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
risks associated with international operations 
the company expects that international sales will account for an increasing portion of its revenues 
most of the company s international revenues are denominated in foreign currencies 
consequently  a decrease in the value of a relevant foreign currency in relation to the us dollar occurring after establishment of prices and before receipt of payment by the company would have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
additionally  the company may be materially and adversely affected by increases in duty rates  exchange or price controls  repatriation restrictions  or other restrictions on foreign currencies 
the company s international operations are subject to certain other risks common to international operations  including without limitation government regulations  import restrictions  and  in certain jurisdictions  reduced protection for the company s intellectual property rights 
change in licensing and marketing methods 
the company is increasingly emphasizing sales to enterprises through volume  installment and enterprise licensing arrangements 
these licensing arrangements typically involve a longer cycle up to months from first contact to execution of an initial license than sales through other distribution channels  require a greater investment of resources in establishing the enterprise relationship and result in lower operating margins 
the timing of the execution of volume licenses  or their nonrenewal or renegotiation by large customers  could cause volatility in the company s quarterly results of operations and could materially adversely affect it s results of operations 
continued reliance on resellers and distributors 
the company expects to continue to rely on resellers and distributors for sales of its products in domestic and international markets 
sales to the company s two largest distributors during fiscal  and accounted for an aggregate of  and of the company s revenues  respectively 
the distribution channels through which software products are sold have been characterized by rapid change  including consolidations and financial difficulties of certain distributors and resellers  the emergence of new resellers such as general mass merchandisers and the development of new channels such as electronic networks 
the company s resellers and distributors carry competing product lines 
there can be no assurance that resellers and distributors will continue to purchase the company s products or be able to market them effectively or that the company will be able to effectively distribute its products through new distribution channels 
reliance on outsourcing 
the company outsources most of the production of its products  which primarily involves duplication of various media and the printing of user manuals and packaging materials 
in addition  the company outsources certain aspects of order fulfillment  technical support  customer service and localization of its products 
so long as it remains economically advantageous to do so  the company intends to continue  and possibly to increase  outsourcing in the future 
although the company believes that it has adequate alternative suppliers of such services  the loss of a supplier or its inability to perform contracted services could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
dependence on proprietary technology 
the company s ability to compete effectively depends in large part on its ability to develop and maintain proprietary aspects of its technology 
the company relies on a combination of copyright  trademark and patent laws  trade secret protection  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions  including nondisclosure agreements with employees and others  to protect its proprietary rights 
however  despite the company s efforts  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of the company s products or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of the company s products is difficult  and while the company is unable to determine the extent to which piracy of its software products exists  software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states 
there can be no assurance that the company s means of protecting its proprietary rights will be adequate  that competitors will not independently develop similar technology or that claims of infringement of third parties intellectual property rights will not occur and  possibly  prevail 
costs associated with an adverse judgment or settlement of intellectual property litigation  as well as the cost of responding to a claim  both in legal fees and expenses and the diversion of management resources  whether or not the claim is valid  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s success depends to a significant extent on a small number of senior management and technical personnel 
the company s growth and future success will depend in large part on its continuing ability to hire  motivate and retain highly qualified management  technical  sales and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in hiring  motivating or retaining such qualified personnel 
changing accounting standards 
the principal organizations responsible for establishing accounting standards  including the securities and exchange commission and the financial accounting standards board  continually review  modify  provide interpretations on and create new accounting standards 
changes to  interpretations of and the creation of new accounting standards could materially modify the presentation of the company s financial results  and such a change in presentation could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
if such changes to accounting standards were applied retroactively  the company may be required to restate its financial statements for prior periods 
reliance on independent developers for future market expansion 
the company has designed its technology with an open architecture and has incorporated certain features to encourage independent solution providers  system integrators and other software developers to design industry or customer specific drawing and diagramming solutions that will extend the adoption and use of the company s products 
there can be no assurance  however  that developers will design solutions to extend the company s products  and the failure of these development efforts to materialize could adversely affect the expansion of the markets for the company s products 
if independent developers do design solutions for specific industries or customers  the company could be effectively precluded from offering add on products that address the same industries or customers
