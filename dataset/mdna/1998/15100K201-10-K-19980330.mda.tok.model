the company s interfaces have been primarily developed by an independent contractor  link medical computing  inc as link completes the development of standard interfaces with various models of equipment and system  these standard interfaces can be reused to reduce the installation time on future crescendo contracts 
at march   the company had signed contracts for crescendo revenue from these contracts will be recognized during to the extent the company completes all significant contract obligations  including installation of system interfaces and customization of data sets
