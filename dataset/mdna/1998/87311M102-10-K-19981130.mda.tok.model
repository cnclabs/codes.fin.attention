throughout fiscal  the company pursued opportunities to enhance its liquidity by the conversion of existing short term trade payables to long term debt and the conversion of debentures into common stock 
management successfully converted separate accounts totaling  in current trade payables into separate notes  with payment terms ranging from to months and interest accruing at rates ranging from to 
further improvements to the company s debt structure were realized by management s election to exercise the company s options to convert its outstanding  debentures to equity 
effective january   the company issued  shares of its common stock in exchange for the outstanding debentures  including accrued interest of  at the conversion price of per share 
in addition to the extremely favorable conversion price for the new issuance  and the elimination of  in future annual interest expense  management s elimination of its primary long term debt significantly enhanced the company s ability to pursue additional sources of equity or debt based working capital 
in july  the company entered into a financing agreement with range energy finance corporation  a subsidiary of range resources corporation nyse rrc  formerly domain energy corporation allowing for the borrowing of up to  the financing was specifically for ongoing development of the company s natural gas producing properties in maverick county  texas 
funds were advanced in exchange for a limited term overriding royalty interest tied to existing and future production from specified depths underlying certain of the company s oil and gas leases in maverick county 
terms provide for repayment of the funds  with interest at  from a specified portion of sales proceeds from all existing and future wells to be drilled on the paloma lease 
by august  the company had borrowed  under the agreement 
throughout the year ended august   the company applied  of its available working capital to fund the ongoing development of its oil and gas properties 
this included drilling and completion costs of  associated with the current year drilling of four new maverick basin gas wells  three new williston basin oil wells and costs associated with wells drilled prior to the current fiscal year  plus  for completion of the newest segment of the company s new gas gathering system in maverick county during also included were d seismic acquisitions totaling  over company leases in north dakota and  on the paloma lease in south texas 
additional investments in non producing lease acreage totaled  for the year 
additionally  the company made payments on its long term debt during the year of  included in the total was  paid during the first quarter  in full prepayment of the company s outstanding line of credit with luzerner kantonalbank 
scheduled payments totaling  were made on the company s remaining long term notes during the remainder of as a result of these activities  the company ended fiscal year with positive working capital of  and a current ratio of to this compares to positive working capital of  and a current ratio of to at august  while the company s working capital position weakened from the previous year  the results of the company s dramatic drilling success ratio during for new glen rose wells will become evident during the first quarter of fiscal year as the latest new wells are placed on production  management is confident of continuing significant improvements in the company s ability to meet its ongoing operating cash requirements 
page during the first quarter of  the company converted  of its debt into  shares of common stock and raised an additional  cash through the exercise of common stock warrants and sales of common stock 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company successfully closed a large transaction that resulted in its acquiring an additional  net acres of undeveloped oil and gas acreage in the williston basin of north and south dakota and montana for  cash and the issuance of  shares of restricted common stock 
simultaneous with the acquisition  the company sold a net profits interest in future wells on the acreage for  cash 
concurrent with the acquisition of undeveloped acreage and sale of the net profits interest  the company received from the same acquiring parties  cash for a debenture convertible into the company s common stock at per share 
during the same quarter  the company completed an offering under regulation s by successfully selling  shares of its common stock for  and also converted  in previously issued convertible debentures into  shares of common stock 
the result of the above transactions was to significantly enhance the company s operating position by giving it additional acreage to develop as well as the working capital with which to drill 
for the entire year  the company raised  net of expenses  through common stock sales and converted  of convertible debentures into common stock and thereby eliminating an on going cash outlay for interest as well as the future repayment of the debt 
the company also raised  through the sale of the net profits interest in future williston basin wells to be drilled and raised an additional  through new debt financing  which included proceeds from the sale of  in convertible debentures plus proceeds from its existing  line of credit 
a portion of this new capital was used to finance the second quarter acquisition of the company s additional  net acres of williston basin oil leases purchased for  cash plus  shares of the company s common stock 
proceeds were also used to fund the company s loss for the year of  including the payment of interest of  payments on current portion of debt and capital leases of  and for capital and investment expenditures of  capital expenditures included approximately  in equipment   in drilling bonds and deposits   in prepaid loan fees and cumulative advances to exprofuels totaling  most significantly   was invested in the development of the company s oil and gas properties  including the drilling of four maverick basin wells in texas  williston basin wells in north dakota  the acquisition of  of d seismic data and  for expansion of the company s maverick county natural gas pipeline infrastructure 
at august   the company had cash of  and working capital of  on current assets of  and current liabilities of  this compared to a cash position of  and a working capital deficit of  at august  in fiscal year  the company raised funds under an agreement with comstar biocapital  inc  a foreign entity  through an offering of the company s common stock to foreign investors

at august   the company had current assets of  and current liabilities of  however  its current assets included  in cash  and its current liabilities included a  convertible note payable not due until may  this compared to a cash position of only  at august  page capital requirements the major components of the company s plans  and the requirements for additional capital at august   include the following maverick basin activity during fiscal  the company plans to drill a minimum of additional wells  in keeping with lease renewal minimum requirements  with a total drilling budget of  drilling on the first four of the planned wells commenced during the first quarter of fiscal initial results indicated the three wells drilled on the paloma lease  the paloma  and the will be completed as gas wells producing from separate patch reefs in the glen rose formation 
the fourth well  the alkek was drilled on a newly acquired  acre lease adjoining the paloma lease 
the lower glen rose reef contained water  therefore  company engineers and geologists are currently evaluating its completion alternatives 
based on interpretation of the company s extensive d seismic database  over potentially drillable patch reef prospects have been identified on the paloma ranch lease  targeting the glen rose formation 
the company s share of the cost of each glen rose well is approximately  for a completed well and  for a dry hole 
company engineers are planning to test other formations with a massive fracturing treatment with the hope of unlocking additional reserves not previously productive due to the formations low permeability 
the fracturing treatment increases the typical gross completion cost of a well by  to  with the company s share being approximately  to  delay rentals required to maintain the company s interest in its remaining undeveloped south texas leasehold acreage for fiscal are williston basin activity due to the continuing weakness in crude oil prices  the company has delayed further expenditures in the williston basin until favorable economics justify the risk of further drilling 
company management intends to continue its review of potential locations for new drilling operations using its d seismic data and intends to make attractive prospects available to other industry operators 
while the company intends to proceed cautiously with its drilling activities  the extensive acreage position it holds in the williston basin requires a high level of drilling activity that comprises a formidable challenge to the company given its limited access to exploration funds 
delay rentals required to maintain the company s interest in its remaining undeveloped williston basin leasehold acreage for fiscal are  plus scheduled area lease options of  due to the company s limited financial resources  management continues to seek  review  and negotiate for acceptable opportunities to participate via farmouts to industry members who would drill red river and lodgepole wells on its acreage  thereby limiting the company s exposure 
summary of capital resources and liquidity subsequent to the end of fiscal  the company successfully drilled and completed three new glen rose gas wells during the first quarter of fiscal year in addition  the company announced in august that it had commenced operation of its new mile extension to its paloma lease gas gathering system 
first quarter operating results will reflect initial production revenues from the paloma e  the paloma e and by late november  the paloma e independent well testing indicates initial production rates should be between million cubic feet of gas per day cfd and million cfd per well upon connection to the company s gathering system 
the company s net revenues from the three wells combined should increase by  to  per year 
while management is confident it has identified sufficient sources of working capital to carry out its current exploration and development plans on its texas leaseholds  as well as to meet its obligations in the ordinary course of business through the end of the new fiscal year  there is no assurance that energy prices will not deteriorate further  causing the company to re evaluate its expected sources of working capital and operating plans 
management is endeavoring to identify additional sources that could provide new funds required to increase its current drilling activity during fiscal year increases in texas gas production from the new gas wells coming on line during the last two quarters of and additional wells coming on line during the first quarter of should continue to offset the effect of lower natural gas prices 
the new wells should provide additional increases of to in the company s monthly oil and gas sales revenues by the second quarter of compared to the respective prior quarters in the newly expanded gas pipeline system has allowed the company to increase revenues by removing a historical restriction on its maverick basin production caused by a lack of available pipeline capacity or alternative sales outlets 
management continues to pursue additional sources of debt and equity financing  and remains hopeful that financial resources will remain available  enabling the company to continue the rapid development of its oil and gas properties and continue to meet its normal operational and debt service obligations 
page year over the last three years the company has replaced or upgraded most of the core management information systems used in the company s business 
the company is currently conducting a review of these systems to verify their compliance with year date codes 
in addition  the company is conducting an inventory  review and assessment of its desktop computers  networks and servers  software applications and packages  and products and services provided by third parties for internal operations to determine whether or not they support year date codes 
the company is also developing an overall plan outlining the tasks  resources and target dates necessary to ensure the ongoing operation of the company s systems through the turn of the century and beyond 
the company plans to complete remediation of the systems that it finds are not in compliance and to begin testing all of its systems in fiscal while the company s inventory  review and assessment is still in process  the company expects that the required modifications will not have a material effect on the company s operating results 
results of operations compared to revenues from oil and gas sales increased over as a result of significant new production from the successful completion of the nine new wells during the last part of the  plus the additional production from new gas wells added during lease operating expenses  related directly to the costs of operating the newly producing williston basin oil wells with very high production associated water disposal costs  increased by over the disproportionately higher increase in lease operating expense increases reflects the difference in the company s normal natural gas production expense level versus the significantly higher per unit production cost associated with its williston basin oil production 
exploration expenses  including the costs of unsuccessful wells  increased by due to the write off of two dry holes during the year compared to only one dry hole in the previous year 
the abrahamson h was drilled late in the fourth quarter of the prior year 
the fall of oil prices at mid year rendered the completion of the well uneconomical 
the dottie was drilled in november and failed to encounter economic quantities of oil 
abandoned leases and equipment increased to  reflecting the ongoing impact of the fall of oil prices during the year that rendered marginal properties uneconomic to maintain or renew 
included in the non cash charge off for the current year are  in williston basin leases   in zavala county leases south texas  and  in canadian crown leases  all determined to be uneconomic and expiring during the current year due to the continued impact of low oil and gas prices 
also included in the non cash writeoff was the remaining capitalized costs  for the kincaid  a horizontal georgetown test well drilled in maverick county during the third quarter of that failed to produce economic quantities of gas 
pursuant to the successful efforts method of accounting for mineral properties  the company periodically assesses its producing properties and non producing mineral leases for impairment 
based on the fall in oil prices during the year and the resulting impact on the updated reserve estimates at year end  the company identified certain producing properties that required impairment 
additionally  non producing leaseholds were reviewed for potential impairment 
certain leases  with expiration dates through december  were identified that will not be renewed 
non cash impairment charges totaling  were recorded at year end including  of williston basin and texas non producing leases set to expire through calendar year additionally  a  impairment was recorded reflecting the excess of unamortized book value over the future realizable reserves primarily related to certain of its williston basin wells 
additional expenses during the year include depreciation  depletion and amortization of  plus current year exploration expenses of  except for the statutory  intangible non cash expenses required for compliance reporting purposes described above and current year exploration expenses  actual operating activities for the year ended august  resulted in positive cash flow from producing operations of  this level of positive cash flow  if sustained  is sufficient to provide for funding of the company s primary administrative operations 
management feels confident this source of internally generated working capital will continue to grow as the company s texas gas production levels expand through fiscal and beyond 
page general and administrative costs increased to  from  increases in salaries totaling approximately  were due primarily to a full twelve months of wages in for the increased number of new employee positions required by the company s expansion in operations as a result of the williston basin lease acquisition versus only a partial year for the previous year 
the  decrease in interest income in reflects the lower cash levels in interest bearing accounts during versus the prior year 
compared to revenues from oil and gas sales increased over  to  from  as a result of significant new production from the successful completion of the nine new wells during the last part of the year 
lease operating expenses  related directly to the costs of operating the producing wells  accordingly increased to  from  in exploration expenses  which includes the costs of unsuccessful wells  increased by to  from  with  in dry hole costs related to the james f 
the well was in the process of drilling at august   but subsequently did not produce sufficient hydrocarbons to be economically viable 
although the company may re enter the well and drill another lateral in a different direction  all costs related to the james f were accrued and included in fiscal operations as a loss  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
other costs included non cash expenses of  in abandoned leases  primarily represented by certain expired acreage in canada  as well as depletion and depreciation of  general and administrative costs increased to  from  due primarily to increased salaries for new employee positions required by the company s expansion in operations as a result of the williston basin lease acquisition 
although interest expense decreased by  this was almost all offset by the write off of deferred financing fees on debt converted during the year 
in total  revenues increased  or  to  in from  in cost of sales  including exploration expenses  general and administrative expenses  and abandoned leases  increased  to  in from  in  resulting in an increase in the company s loss from its oil and gas operations to  in from  in the company also incurred a loss on its investment in exprofuels of  compared to  in however  since this investment has been written down to zero dollars  and no additional cash advances are expected after december   advances committed to exprofuels of  for september  to december  were accrued at august  operations should not suffer from this investment in future periods 
as a result of the above  loss from operations increased to  in from  in compared to revenues from oil and gas sales increased by in to  from  in  primarily as a result of higher gas sales due to the successful completion of the paloma b during and the first full year of production from the paloma and the paloma a h 
additionally  gas prices increased an average of during over levels 
lease operating expenses for increased to  from  in reflecting a higher number of operated properties and overall higher costs in operating certain producing wells 
exploration expenses increased by  due to the drilling of two dry holes during the year  the paloma c and the paloma d additionally  during  the company expensed the costs incurred in in drilling the paloma  which remained shut in at the end of pending its final evaluation 
depletion per equivalent barrel of production increased to in from in  resulting in an overall increase of  depletion expense for the year 
other costs included an increase in interest expense to  from  in attributable to interest accruing for a full year in versus a partial year in on the company s primary convertible note payable which had an outstanding balance of  at august  page in total  revenues increased  or  from  in to  in costs of sales  including general and administrative  depreciation  depletion and amortization  increased only  thereby resulting in a net decrease to prior year losses from operations of  other income and expense  in total  decreased by  with an increase in interest expense of  being partially offset by an increase in interest income of  and an increase in sublease income of  as a result  the company s net loss decreased to  in from  in item a
