impacted by an increase in consumer credit problems and personal bankruptcies  the demand for home furnishings in the niche in which the company serves has been low over the past two fiscal years 
in response to this difficult environment  heilig meyers company the company conducted a comprehensive review of its operations  and developed a profit improvement plan the plan  which was announced on december  the plan has three main components expense reductions  restructuring of certain aspects of the business  and heilig meyers store operating initiatives 
the plan calls for the closing of certain heilig meyers stores  the downsizing of administrative and support facilities  a reorganization of the heilig meyers private label credit card program  and the development of operating initiatives to improve the performance of the heilig meyers stores 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a pre tax charge of approximately million related to specific plans to close approximately heilig meyers stores  downsize office and support facilities  and reorganize the heilig meyers private label credit card program 
the charge reduced net earnings million or 
per share 
the pre tax charge includes the following components million for severance  million for lease and facility exit costs  million for fixed asset impairment  and million for goodwill impairment 
the company expects to substantially complete the store closings and office downsizing during the first quarter of fiscal  and private label credit card program reorganization during fiscal accordingly  the majority of the reserves are expected to be utilized during fiscal the final plan calls for closing approximately stores rather than the approximately stores initially contemplated  as a result of the completion of store operations and asset disposition analyses 
the core store operating initiatives include a plan to significantly slow the growth of the heilig meyers stores over the next year to allow for the maturation of the recent store additions 
approximately to stores will be relocated to higher traffic areas 
the initiatives also call for adjustments to merchandising and advertising strategies based on the remaining markets and the strengthening of the inventory management programs 
while management plans to slow the growth in the heilig meyers division  it expects to pursue opportunities in the company s other formats 
these opportunities will be in the formats that are less capital intensive and are currently operating at higher levels of return than the heilig meyers division 
the company has adopted a capital allocation process under which all expansion and capital projects will be subjected to return on investment criteria 
pursuant to these initiatives  raw selling margins in the fourth quarter of fiscal were negatively impacted by approximately million  or 
of sales  due to inventory liquidations 
approximately million 
of sales in selling  general and administrative expenses were incurred related to asset write downs and other reserves in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal see costs and expenses 
while the company anticipates that the majority of the reserves related to this plan will be utilized over the first two quarters of fiscal  amounts related to property and long term lease commitments will continue to be utilized subsequent to this time period 
the overall cash impact of the plan is expected to be positive as cash received from the sale of certain assets and from income tax benefits is expected to significantly exceed cash expenditures  which will consist primarily of employee severance and payments under lease obligations 
revenues sales for fiscal compared to the two previous periods are shown below fiscal year sales in thousands    percentage increase over prior period portion of increase from existing comparable stores portion of increase from new stores the growth in total sales of the company for fiscal years  and is primarily attributed to the growth in operating units through acquisitions 
the impact of price changes on sales growth over the last three fiscal years has been insignificant 
expansion of the heilig meyers retail units during fiscal and was primarily in the south central  southwestern and northwestern united states 
the company has four primary retail formats targeting a wide range of consumers 
the increase in these formats over the past two years has been achieved through acquisitions 
sales for the last three fiscal years and store counts as of february   were as follows fiscal year sales amounts in millions of of of of of of stores sales total stores sales total stores sales total heilig meyers    rhodes the roomstore mattress discounters total     on december   rhodes  inc  a georgia corporation  became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company in a transaction accounted for under the purchase method 
the company operates these stores under the rhodes name and format 
these stores are primarily located in metropolitan areas of southern  midwestern and western states 
in late february  the company acquired certain assets relating to stores operating in central texas under the name the roomstore in a transaction accounted for under the purchase method 
the roomstore operates under a rooms concept  displaying and selling furniture in complete room packages 
at the end of fiscal  the roomstore operated stores  of which were acquired from reliable inc in columbia  maryland  in february and of which were acquired in january from john m 
smyth s homemakers in chicago  illinois 
the remaining additions to the roomstore format were through the ongoing conversion of pre existing heilig meyers and rhodes stores 
in july  the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of mattress discounters corporation and a related corporation mattress discounters with stores in states and washington  dc the transaction was accounted for under the purchase method 
in january  the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of bedding experts  inc  with stores in chicago  illinois  and the surrounding area 
the transaction was recorded as a pooling of interests  however  prior periods have not been restated as the effect is not considered material to the consolidated financial statements 
these stores are included in the mattress discounters format in the table above 
other income decreased to of sales for fiscal from of sales for fiscal other income decreased to of sales for fiscal from of sales for fiscal these decreases are primarily the result of the effect of rhodes  the roomstore and mattress discounters operations  as these stores credit programs are maintained by third parties and  unlike the heilig meyers in house program  do not produce finance income for the company 
excluding the results of rhodes  the roomstore and mattress discounters  other income decreased 
of sales for the year ended february   compared to the prior fiscal year 
the company plans to continue its program of periodically securitizing a portion of the installment accounts receivable portfolio of its heilig meyers stores 
proceeds from securitized accounts receivable are generally used by the company to lower debt levels 
net servicing income related to securitized receivables that have been sold to third parties is included in other income 
the company offers third party private label credit card programs to customers of the rhodes and the roomstore formats 
costs and expenses in fiscal  costs of sales increased  as a percentage of sales  to from in fiscal year this increase is the result of the liquidation of merchandise associated with acquisitions  reduced leverage on distribution and occupancy costs  and higher occupancy costs in the larger markets served by the rhodes and the roomstore formats 
raw selling margins were reduced by approximately million  or 
of sales  due to inventory liquidation sales in the rhodes stores and heilig meyers stores in puerto rico see profit improvement plan 
costs of sales decreased to of sales in fiscal from in fiscal the reduction in costs of sales was primarily related to improved raw selling margins in the heilig meyers stores 
a reduction in the use of aggressive  price cutting promotions and improvement in day to day pricing policies were the primary contributors to the raw selling margin results 
additionally  as compared to fiscal  the merchandise sales mix for fiscal included a higher percentage of furniture and bedding  which carry higher raw selling margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to of sales in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease between years was the result of leverage gained on sales at the rhodes  the roomstore and mattress discounters formats 
compared to the prior year period  the addition of these formats has resulted in a lower administrative cost structure generally due to the use of third party credit providers 
however  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal include charges of approximately million  or 
of sales  related to asset write downs and other reserves see profit improvement plan 
these charges arise primarily from asset impairment caused by the conversion of existing stores to new operating formats  relocations of administrative and support facilities  and a more aggressive strategy to exit excess real estate 
also included in this amount are legal and other transaction costs associated with the bedding experts acquisition  which was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to of sales in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily the result of loss of sales leverage on fixed type expenses such as base salaries  data processing  and depreciation and amortization  given the modest decline in comparable store sales during the fiscal year 
advertising costs in fiscal were slightly down as a percentage of sales compared to fiscal interest expense was and of sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease is mainly due to leverage on the sales by rhodes  the roomstore and mattress discounters  which were purchased with common stock 
the company issued million in public debt during the second quarter of fiscal the company also issued approximately million in public debt in the last half of fiscal as part of the financing strategy discussed below 
weighted average long term interest rates for fiscal remained relatively consistent at  compared to during the prior year 
weighted average short term debt increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal weighted average short term interest rates increased to from in the prior year 
interest expense was of sales in fiscal years and the impact of an increase in weighted average long term debt of million was offset by lower weighted average interest rates  which decreased to from on long term debt and to from on short term debt in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in long term debt levels in both fiscal and was consistent with the company s plan to structure its debt portfolio to contain a higher percentage of long term fixed rate debt in order to minimize the exposure to future short term interest rate fluctuations 
the provision for doubtful accounts was of sales in fiscal compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in the provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of sales resulted from an increase in the installment portfolio s loss rate and related write offs  the impact of management s plan to close approximately stores  and management s plan to reorganize the heilig meyers private label credit card program 
the overall rise in the portfolio s loss rate is primarily attributed to an increase in bankruptcies 
the company provided an additional million for doubtful bankrupt accounts based on the increase in the total bankrupt account portfolio  the mix of accounts by type of bankruptcy filed  and recent collection experience 
the company also provided for increased write offs of approximately million related to a more critical evaluation of accounts for write off for fiscal and to cover the impact of transferring the servicing of accounts from stores that are planned for closing in fiscal to other heilig meyers store locations 
additionally  management has committed to a reorganization of the heilig meyers private label credit card program  which is offered to certain customers under an agreement with a financial institution 
the company provided million to cover estimated losses under the recourse provisions of the agreement that will be incurred as a result of the reorganization plan 
the items noted above  which total of sales in fiscal were slightly offset by the operations of rhodes  the roomstore  and mattress discounters as these formats primarily use third party credit providers and  accordingly  do not record significant provisions for doubtful accounts 
total portfolio write offs for fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
of these amounts  million  million and million were for purchased receivables  respectively 
management believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts at february   is adequate 
components of the profit improvement plan address the increase in the portfolio loss rate 
stores that have been targeted for closing have been among the poorest performers related to credit losses 
management believes the elimination of these stores will positively impact the company s credit losses going forward 
the company plans to more fully implement risk based scoring models to provide local management with better tools in making credit extension decisions 
these models will also enable corporate management to more efficiently monitor the portfolio 
management believes implementing this plan at the local and corporate levels will also positively impact the portfolio s credit losses 
provision for income taxes and net earnings the income tax benefit for fiscal was calculated by applying a percentage of compared to fiscal s tax rate of 
the decrease in the rate from is due to the impact of the loss incurred during  offset by the higher effective tax rates of the recently acquired operating subsidiaries 
the higher rates result from the carryover tax attributes of acquired assets and liabilities 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the decrease between the fiscal and effective tax rate was primarily the result of higher fixed dollar income tax credits in fiscal and lower levels of pretax earnings 
the net loss for fiscal was million compared to earnings of million for fiscal the loss in fiscal was the result of the store closing and other charges related to the profit improvement plan discussed above and the increase in the provision for doubtful accounts in fiscal the net earnings for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal as a percentage of sales  profit margin decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the decrease was mostly attributable to an increase as a percentage of sales in selling  general and administrative expenses due to the decline in comparable store sales and an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts 
liquidity and capital resources the company increased its cash position million to million at february   from million at february   and million at february  as the company continued to expand its store base through acquisitions  cash flows used for investing activities exceeded cash provided by operating activities for fiscal years  and the company s operating activities typically use cash primarily because the significant majority of customer sales in the heilig meyers format have been through the company s in house credit program 
these uses of cash have been partially offset by proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable and financing activities 
operating activities used cash of million for fiscal compared to cash used of million in fiscal and cash provided of million in fiscal the company traditionally produces minimal or negative cash flow from operating activities because it extends in house credit in its heilig meyers stores 
the company s change in accounts receivable and provision for doubtful accounts netted to a million increase in fiscal the company s retained interest in securitized receivables at cost decreased million during fiscal as the result of the sale of certain of these investments 
the company s retained interest in securitized receivables at cost grew by million in fiscal with accounts receivable decreasing by million 
these changes relate to the sale of million of receivables and the change in classification of certain receivables transferred to a master trust during fiscal the higher level of receivables transferred relate to the continued extension of credit to customers and a reduced amount of accounts sold during the year as compared to the amounts sold in fiscal during fiscal  inventory levels increased at a higher rate than fiscal primarily due to the stocking of line up inventory in the recently acquired stores in order to support the merchandising plan 
the prior increases in inventory levels have primarily been the result of the opening of new heilig meyers stores in fiscal and in fiscal continued extension of credit and related increases in customer accounts receivable  as well as increases in inventory related to new stores  are expected to be negative cash flow activities in future periods 
however  as noted above  the company periodically sells accounts receivable to provide a source of positive cash flows from operating activities 
investing activities produced negative cash flows of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal cash used for acquisitions decreased in to million compared to million in fiscal as a result of a lower level of acquisition activity in fiscal cash used for acquisitions was relatively consistent in fiscal compared to fiscal  at million and million  respectively 
cash used for additions to property and equipment resulted from the opening of new store locations and related support facilities as well as the remodeling and improvement of existing and acquired locations 
the increase in the cash required for capital expenditures in fiscal was the result of a larger number of prototype stores and support facilities completed or under construction as of february   compared to february  the increase in the disposals of property and equipment between fiscal and is the result of the beginning phases of the company s profit improvement plan 
see the discussion concerning the company s future expansion and disposition plans under profit improvement plan above 
financing activities provided a positive net cash flow of million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal in june  the company and a wholly owned subsidiary filed a joint registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission relating to up to million aggregate principal amount of securities 
as of february   long term notes payable with an aggregate principal amount of million have been issued to the public under this registration statement 
long term notes payable with an aggregate principal amount of million were issued to the public during fiscal proceeds from the issues were used to retire long term debt maturing and short term notes payable 
all previously issued debt had been in private placements rather than public markets 
as of february   the company had a million revolving credit facility in place which expires in july this facility includes thirteen banks and had million outstanding and million unused as of february  the company also had additional lines of credit with banks totaling million  all of which was unused as of february  as a result of charges recorded in fiscal under the profit improvement plan  the company obtained amendments to its bank debt agreements in order to maintain covenant compliance 
in addition  certain provisions of the company s bond indenture restrict the company s ability to incur long term debt until certain covenant restrictions are met 
management expects to meet these covenants in the fourth quarter of fiscal however  management believes that the company has adequate access to capital to finance accounts receivable  inventories and other capital needs during these next twelve months 
total debt as a percentage of debt and equity was at february   compared to and at february   and  respectively 
the increase in total debt as a percentage of debt and equity from february  to february  is primarily attributed to the issuance of million of long term debt as well as the increase in short term notes payable during fiscal the issuance was partially offset by the payment on the maturity of long term notes 
the fiscal loss  which reduced retained earnings  also resulted in the increase of total debt as a percentage of debt and equity 
the current ratio was x at february   compared to x and x for february   and  respectively 
the decrease in the current ratios from february  to february  was primarily attributed to an million increase in long term debt due within one year 
other information year issue during fiscal year  management established a team to oversee the company s year date conversion project 
after conducting its assessment of all systems  management implemented a plan of corrective action using both internal and external resources to enhance the systems for year compliance 
management expects to complete the project during fiscal year  and does not anticipate the amounts required to be expensed as part of the corrective plan to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the team is communicating with other companies on which the company s systems rely and is planning to obtain compliance letters from these entities 
however  there can be no assurance that the systems of these other companies will be converted in a timely manner  or that any such failure to convert by another company would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems 
management believes the year compliance issue is being addressed properly by the company to prevent any material adverse operational or financial impacts 
however  if such enhancements are not completed in a timely manner  the year issue may have a material adverse impact on the operations of the company
