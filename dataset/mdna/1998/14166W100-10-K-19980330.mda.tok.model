in thousands statements of operations revenues         salaries  wages and benefits         other operating expenses   depreciation and amortization acquired in process research and development costs    operating income loss    interest income expense  net other expense provision for income taxes income loss before extraordinary item  extraordinary item net income loss   the company s quarterly revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past 
quarterly results have fluctuated as a result of a variety of factors including but not limited to the following the company s sales cycle  staffing changes in the company s sales and marketing organization  changes in the company s resources  demand for the company s products  the timing of significant new customer contracts  the non renewal of significant customer contracts  the timing of acquisitions  competitive conditions in the industry  changes in customer budgets  and general economic factors 
furthermore  the company has experienced a seasonal pattern in its operating results  with a greater proportion of the company s revenue and operating profitability occurring in the second half of the year 
the company attributes this seasonality to a combination of factors including budgeting and other factors affecting the health care industry generally  the compounding effect of historical renewal schedules which typically results in greater license renewals in the third and fourth quarters and internal staffing and growth issues 
the company believes the licensing and subsequent renewal pattern of its market performance products are more seasonal than its other products and expects the addition of new products  including those from acquisitions  to moderate  but not end  this seasonal effect 
a significant portion of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  and the amount and timing of increases in such expenses are based in large part on the company s expectations concerning future revenue 
if revenues are below expectations in any given quarter  the adverse effect may be magnified by the company s inability to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for the revenue shortfall 
accordingly  even a small variation from expected revenue could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations for a given quarter 
software capitalization in addition to acquisitions  the company seeks to expand its product offerings through internal product development 
prior to  the company expensed internal development costs due to the nominal costs incurred between technological feasibility and product release 
in the company began capitalizing internal product development costs which were incurred after technological feasibility had been established and prior to general product release 
capitalized software development costs net of accumulated amortization totaled million at december  income taxes the company recorded income tax expense of  during due to limitations on the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and the nondeductability of certain acquired in process research and development costs to offset taxable income 
at december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal income tax purposes 
the net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in through the total gross deferred tax asset was approximately million as of december  and has been reduced to zero by a valuation allowance and offsetting deferred income tax liabilities of approximately million 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
applying the provisions of sfas to the company  particularly considering the company s history of net losses  the company was unable to support a conclusion consistent with sfas that it is more likely than not that it will generate future taxable income during the loss carryforward periods  therefore  the company has provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets 
in determining that a valuation allowance was required  management primarily considered such factors as the company s history of operating losses and expected near term future losses and earnings  the nature of the company s deferred tax assets  the absence of significant excess of appreciated asset value over the tax basis of the company s net assets  the absence of taxable income in prior carryback years and the potential for deferred tax assets resulting from future business acquisitions 
although management s operating plans assume taxable and operating income in future periods  historical performance has produced an accumulated deficit of million at december  consequently  the company has provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets until such time as the company produces sufficient taxable and operating income to support a lower valuation allowance 
at december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which expire beginning in through under internal revenue code section  the company s use of net operating loss carryforwards is limited to approximately million per year as a result of the company s initial public offering completed in january see note h of notes to consolidated financial statements 
approximately million of the net operating loss at december  relates to loss carryforwards acquired in connection with the acquisitions 
accordingly  such losses are limited to income generated by the acquired entity as well as substantial annual limitations 
liquidity and capital resources the company completed its initial public offering of common stock in january and received approximately million in net proceeds 
approximately million of these net proceeds were used to repay a senior subordinated note and certain notes issued in connection with the company s acquisition of practicematch  to pay accrued dividends on the company s series a and series b convertible preferred stock and to repay a bridge loan provided by nationsbank 
in  the company used million of the remaining net proceeds of its initial public offering for working capital and general corporate purposes  including the funding of the acquisitions and development of new products 
in march  nationsbank and the company entered into a credit agreement under which a million revolving credit facility the nationsbank revolver is available to the company 
the nationsbank revolver is secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
under the terms of the nationsbank revolver the company may  subject to customary terms  conditions and covenants  borrow up to million to fund working capital needs  new product development and acquisitions 
the credit agreement for the nationsbank revolver provides for interest at varying rates based on libor and nationsbank s prime rate and will mature on march  under the terms of the nationsbank revolver  the company is subject to various restrictive covenants regarding  among other things  payment of any dividends  capital expenditures limitations  incurrence of indebtedness from others in excess of certain amounts  and consummation of certain mergers and acquisitions without the consent of nationsbank 
financial covenants include  but are not limited to  maintaining debt to capitalization ratios  minimum net worth ratios  debt service coverage ratios and cash flow leverage ratios 
no amounts were outstanding under the credit agreement during the company currently has no specific plans with respect to the use of the remaining million of the net proceeds of its initial public offering or the nationsbank revolver  and the company s cash flow from operations has generally been sufficient to fund the liquidity needs of the company other than acquisitions and new product development 
the company anticipates that borrowings under the nationsbank revolver and the remaining net proceeds of the initial public offering will be used principally for working capital and general corporate purposes  for potential acquisitions of complementary businesses or products in the health care information industry and for the development of additional products 
pending the application of the remaining net proceeds of its initial public offering  the company has invested such proceeds in short term  interest bearing  investment grade securities 
in january  the company and healthplan services corporation hpsc entered into a securities purchase agreement  under which hpsc purchased  shares of series b convertible preferred stock for million and agreed to purchase up to million in original principal amount of senior subordinated notes 
in connection with the issuance of the senior subordinated notes  the company agreed to issue warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock for per share 
in march  the company issued million in original principal amount of the senior subordinated notes to hpsc and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
in february  these warrants were exercised 
the company used million of the proceeds from the sale of series b convertible preferred stock to complete the acquisition of formations 
medirisk used approximately million of the proceeds from the issuance of the senior subordinated notes to complete the acquisition of practicematch 
in addition  in connection with the practicematch acquisition  the company issued acquisition notes to the sellers in an aggregate principal amount of million 
the hpsc senior subordinated notes  a nationsbank bridge loan and the acquisition notes were repaid in full upon the completion of the company s initial public offering in january upon such repayment hpsc s obligation to purchase additional senior subordinated notes terminated 
the company had working capital of million as of december  as compared to a working capital deficit of million as of december  this increase is primarily due to the receipt of the net proceeds of the company s initial public offering 
net cash used by operating activities totaled  for the year ended december   as compared  for the prior year 
the decrease in cash used of  was primarily the result of the timing of customer payments 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the prior year 
in  million was used to fund the acquisitions of formations and practicematch  while  in  million was used to fund the acquisitions 
the remaining million of net cash used in investing activities in the year ended december  was used to fund fixed asset purchases and software development 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the same period in the prior year 
as previously discussed  in the company retained million of the net proceeds from its initial public offering  and the cash provided in resulted from the net proceeds under the hpsc securities purchase agreement 
the company believes that the remaining proceeds of its initial public offering  borrowings under the nationsbank revolver and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the capital expenditure and working capital needs for the company s operations for the near term 
the company s future liquidity and cash requirements will depend on a wide range of factors  including costs associated with development of new products  enhancements of existing products and acquisitions 
although the company has no present commitments or agreements regarding acquisitions  the company s strategy is to acquire additional complementary products and businesses 
if the remaining proceeds of the initial public offering  borrowings under the nationsbank revolver and cash flow from operations are not sufficient to fund such acquisitions  the company will be required to seek additional financing  and there can be no assurance that such financing will be available in amounts and on terms acceptable to the company
