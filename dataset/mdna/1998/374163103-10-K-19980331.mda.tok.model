item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview geron is a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering therapeutic and diagnostic products based upon common biological mechanisms underlying cancer and other age related diseases 
the company s results of operations have fluctuated from period to period and will continue to fluctuate in the future based upon the timing and composition of funding under various collaborative agreements 
results of operations for any period may be unrelated to results of operations for any other period 
in addition  historical results should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in part ii  item of this report on form k 
on december   the company entered into a license  product and marketing agreement with boehringer mannheim to develop and commercialize research and clinical diagnostic products for cancer on an exclusive  worldwide basis 
under the collaboration boehringer mannheim provided reimbursement for research previously conducted and will be responsible for all clinical  regulatory  manufacturing  marketing and sales efforts and expenses 
in addition  the company is entitled to receive future payments upon achievement of certain contractual milestones relating to levels of product sales  as well as royalties on product sales 
further  the company has an option to exercise co promotion rights in the united states 
in connection with this collaboration  the company recognized  of revenue for reimbursement of past research efforts 
on march   the company completed a private placement with two institutional investors for the sale of  shares of series a convertible preferred stock with a stated value of  per share resulting in proceeds of million 
the series a convertible preferred stock is convertible into the number of shares of common stock of the company equal to the stated value plus a premium of per annum divided by a conversion price 
the conversion price of the preferred stock is based on the market price of the common stock during a pricing period preceding conversion  up to a conversion price cap of 
with limited exceptions  during the nine month period following issuance  the preferred stock is convertible only after the market price of the common stock equals or exceeds per share 
the preferred stock is subject to redemption at the company s option if the market price of the common stock exceeds or falls below certain thresholds 
the company has agreed to register the resale of the underlying common stock under the securities act of in accordance with the stock purchase agreement with pharmacia upjohn  spa  in march  pharmacia upjohn purchased million of geron common stock  at a premium 
geron is subject to risks common to companies in its industry and at its stage of development  including risks inherent in its research and development efforts  reliance upon collaborative partners  enforcement of patent and proprietary rights  need for future capital  potential competition and uncertainty of regulatory approvals or clearances 
in order for a product to be commercialized based on the company s research  it will be necessary for geron and collaborators to conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate efficacy and safety of the company s product candidates  obtain regulatory approvals or clearances and enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  as well as obtain market acceptance 
the company does not expect to receive revenues or royalties based on therapeutic products for a period of years 
see additional factors that may affect future results 
results of operations revenues the company recognized revenues of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal revenues in were research support payments under the company s collaborative agreements with pharmacia upjohn spa pharmacia upjohn and kyowa hakko kogyo co  ltd 
kyowa hakko 
in addition  revenues included the one time payment by boehringer mannheim for reimbursement of past research efforts 
revenues in and were research support payments from kyowa hakko 
the company recognizes revenue as the related research and development costs are incurred under the collaborative agreements 
annual funding payments of million each were received under the kyowa hakko agreement in fiscal and and million in fiscal funding payments totaling million were received under the pharmacia upjohn agreement in fiscal the company expects to receive an aggregate of million from the kyowa hakko and pharmacia upjohn collaborations in the company receives license payments and royalties from license and marketing agreements with various diagnostic collaborators 
no license fee payments were received in in fiscal  the company received  in royalties from oncor  kyowa medex  boehringer mannheim  and pharmingen on the sale of diagnostic kits to the research use only market 
in fiscal  upon entering into a license and marketing agreement with kyowa medex  the company received a  license fee payment from kyowa medex 
in fiscal  the company received  in royalties from oncor and kyowa medex 
no royalties or license fee payments were received in research and development expenses research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increases in and were primarily due to expanded patent related activities  increases in support of key outside collaborators and greater purchases of research materials and laboratory supplies for the expansion of the company s research programs 
the company expects research and development expenses to increase significantly in the future as a result of continued development of its therapeutic and diagnostic programs 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the slight decrease in was the net effect of a decrease in administrative personnel and an increase in investor and public relations expenses 
the increase in expenses in was primarily due to increases in staffing  amortization of deferred compensation  higher legal  travel and other expenses related to business development and other costs of being a public company 
interest and other income interest income was million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increases in and were due to higher average cash and investment balances as a result of the sale of equity securities  completion of the company s initial public offering and research funding received under the kyowa hakko and pharmacia upjohn collaborative agreements 
interest earned in the future will depend on the company s funding cycles and prevailing interest rates 
the company also received   and  in research payments under government grants for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company does not expect income from government grants to substantially increase in the future 
interest and other expense interest and other expense were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in was due to an increase in bank charges during the year as a result of higher cash and short term investment balances 
the decrease in was due to lower outstanding capital lease obligations as a result of certain leases expiring during the year 
higher outstanding capital lease balances existed during the company expects interest and other expense to moderately increase as it intends to increase equipment financing 
net loss net loss was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in net loss for was the net result of increased revenue from research support payments from the pharmacia upjohn  kyowa hakko and boehringer mannheim collaborative agreements which more than offset the increase in operating expenses during the year 
the increase in net loss for was primarily due to the increase in operating expenses during that year 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  were million compared to million at december  and million at december  it is the company s investment policy to invest these funds in liquid  investment grade securities  such as interest bearing money market funds  corporate notes  commercial paper and municipal securities 
the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments for was the net result of increased research funding support payments and increased operating expenses during the year 
the increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments for was primarily due to the completion of the company s initial public offering in july net cash used in operations was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in net cash used in operations for was due to an increase in research support payments as a result of funding under the pharmacia upjohn collaborative agreement entered into in the increase in net cash used in operations for was primarily due to higher expenses incurred as a result of expanded research and development programs 
the company expects its net cash used in operations may increase in due to increased research and development expenditures and decreased research support payments from kyowa hakko 
the company has funded its operations primarily through public and private equity financings 
the company has also received additional funding from collaborative agreements  grant revenues  interest income and equipment financing 
in january  pharmacia upjohn purchased an initial equity investment of million in geron at a premium 
in april and march  pharmacia upjohn purchased an aggregate of million million at each date of geron common stock at a premium 
on march   the company completed a private placement with two institutional investors for the sale of  shares of series a convertible preferred stock with a stated value of  per share resulting in proceeds of million 
the series a convertible preferred stock is convertible into the number of shares of common stock of the company equal to the stated value plus a premium of per annum divided by a conversion price 
the conversion price of the preferred stock is based on the market price of the common stock during a pricing period preceding conversion  up to a conversion price cap of 
with limited exceptions  during the nine month period following issuance  the preferred stock is convertible only after the market price of the common stock equals or exceeds per share 
the preferred stock is subject to redemption at the company s option if the market price of the common stock exceeds or falls below certain thresholds 
the company has agreed to register the resale of the underlying common stock under the securities act of in accordance with the stock purchase agreement with pharmacia upjohn  spa  in march  pharmacia upjohn purchased million of geron common stock  at a premium 
through december   the company had invested approximately million in property and equipment  of which approximately million was financed through equipment financing 
minimum annual payments due under the equipment financing facility are expected to total million    and  in   and  respectively 
as of december   the company had approximately  available for borrowing under its equipment financing facility 
the company estimates that its existing capital resources including the proceeds from the private placement completed in march  payments under the pharmacia upjohn and kyowa hakko collaborative agreements  interest income and equipment financing will be sufficient to fund its current and planned operations through there can be no assurance  however  that changes in the company s research and development plans or other changes affecting the company s operating expenses will not result in the expenditure of available resources before such time  and in any event  the company will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund its operations in future periods 
the company intends to seek additional funding through strategic collaborations  public or private equity financings  capital lease transactions or other financing sources that may be available 
additional factors that may affect future results the company desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of specifically  the company wishes to alert readers that  except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this report constitute forward looking statements that are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties 
these and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company are described below 
technological uncertainty the study of the mechanisms of cellular aging and cellular immortality  including telomere biology and telomerase  is a relatively new area of research  and there can be no assurance that this research will lead to the discovery or development of any therapeutic or diagnostic product 
if and when potential lead drug compounds or product candidates are identified through the company s research programs  they will require significant preclinical and clinical testing prior to regulatory approval in the united states and elsewhere  and there can be no assurance that any of these efforts will result in a product that can be marketed 
because of the significant additional scientific  regulatory and commercial milestones that must be reached for the company s research programs to be successful  there can be no assurance that any program will not be abandoned after significant resources have been expended 
the abandonment of any research program could have a material adverse effect on the company 
as a result of its drug discovery efforts to date  the company has identified compounds in in vitro studies that demonstrate potential for inhibiting telomerase in vivo 
however  additional development efforts will be required prior to the selection of a lead compound for preclinical development and clinical trials as a telomerase inhibitor for cancer 
if and when selected  a lead compound may prove to have undesirable and unintended side effects or other characteristics affecting its efficacy or safety that may prevent or limit its commercial use 
for example  telomerase is active in reproductive cells and transiently expressed in certain hematopoietic blood and gastrointestinal cells 
there can be no assurance that any product based on the inhibition of telomerase will not adversely affect such cells and result in unacceptable side effects 
in addition  it is expected that telomerase inhibition will have delayed efficacy as telomeres resume normal shortening and  as a result  will in most cases  be used in conjunction with other cancer therapies 
there can be no assurance that the delayed efficacy of a telomerase inhibitor will not have a material adverse effect on the preclinical and clinical development  ability to obtain regulatory approval or marketability of a telomerase inhibitor for the treatment of cancer 
the abandonment of the telomerase inhibition and detection program would have a material adverse effect on the company 
with respect to the development and commercial application of the company s proprietary telomerase detection technology  there is  as yet  insufficient clinical data to confirm its full utility to diagnose  prognose  monitor patient status and screen for cancer 
although the company s licensees  oncor  boehringer mannheim  kyowa medex and pharmingen have commenced the sale of kits for research use  additional development work and regulatory consents will be necessary prior to the introduction of tests for clinical use 
with respect to the company s genomics of aging program  the company has identified certain genes that are expressed differentially in senescent cells versus replicatively young cells 
however  the company has not identified any lead compounds that have been demonstrated to modulate such gene expression  and there can be no assurance that any such lead compound will be discovered or developed 
the part of the company s genomics of aging program that is designed to modulate telomere length is at an early stage of development 
while telomere length and replicative capacity have been extended in vitro  there can be no assurance that the company will discover a compound that will modulate telomere length or increase replicative capacity effectively for clinical use 
the company s primordial stem cell program is also at an early stage 
while primate primordial stem ps cells have been isolated and allowed to expand and differentiate into numerous cell types  there can be no assurance that the company s efforts to isolate the human primordial stem cell and develop products therefrom will result in any commercial applications 
the company may become aware of technology controlled by third parties that is advantageous to the company s programs 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to acquire or license such technology on reasonable terms  if at all 
in the event that the company is unable to acquire such technology  the company may be required to expend significant time and resources to develop similar technology  and there can be no assurance that it will be successful in this regard 
if the company cannot acquire or develop necessary technology  it may be prevented from pursuing certain business objectives 
moreover  a competitor of the company could acquire or license such technology 
any such event could have a material adverse effect on the company 
early stage of development geron is at an early stage in the development of therapeutic and diagnostic products 
the company has not yet selected a lead compound for any of its drug development programs 
in order to identify and select such a compound  it must have access to sufficient numbers of chemical compounds and resources  of which there can be no assurance 
products that may result from the company s research and development programs are not expected to be commercially available for a number of years  if at all 
the company s program to identify a telomerase inhibitor is currently at the drug discovery stage  while the company s other programs are currently focused on research efforts prior to drug discovery or preclinical development 
it is difficult to predict when  if ever  the company will select a lead compound for drug development as a telomerase inhibitor 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s other programs will move beyond their current stage 
assuming the company s research advances and the company is able to identify and select a lead compound for telomerase inhibition  certain preclinical development efforts will be necessary to determine whether the potential product has sufficient safety to enter clinical trials 
if such a potential product receives authorization from the united states food and drug administration the fda to enter clinical trials  then it will most likely be subjected to a multiphase  multicenter clinical study to determine its safety and efficacy 
it is not possible to predict the length or extent of clinical trials or the period of any required patient follow up 
assuming clinical trials of any potential product are successful and other data are satisfactory  the company will submit an application to the fda and appropriate regulatory bodies in other countries to seek permission to market the product 
the review process at the fda is substantial and lengthy  and there can be no assurance that the fda will approve the company s application or will not require additional clinical trials or other data prior to approval 
furthermore  even if such approval is ultimately obtained  delays in the approval process could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any potential product will be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at a reasonable cost or that such product will be successfully marketed 
based on the foregoing  the company does not anticipate being able to commence marketing of any therapeutic products for a period of years  if at all 
there can be no assurance that any of the company s product development efforts will be successfully completed  that regulatory approvals will be obtained  or that the company s products  if any  will achieve market acceptance 
dependence on strategic and research collaborations the company s strategy for the development  clinical testing and commercialization of its products includes entering into collaborations with corporate partners  licensors  licensees and others  and the company is dependent upon the subsequent success of these other parties in performing their respective responsibilities 
the success of any collaboration depends on the continued cooperation of its partners  as to which there can be no assurance 
the amount and timing of resources to be devoted to activities by its collaborators are not within the direct control of the company 
there can be no assurance that such partners will perform their obligations as expected or that the company will derive any benefits from such arrangements 
there can also be no assurance that the company s current collaborators or any future collaborators will not pursue existing or alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with the company 
the company currently has no manufacturing infrastructure and no marketing or sales organization  and intends to rely in substantial part on its current and future strategic partners for the manufacture of any product and the principal marketing and sales responsibilities for any such product 
to the extent the company chooses not to or is unable to establish such arrangements  the company will require substantially greater capital to undertake its own manufacturing  marketing and sales of any product 
in april  the company entered into a license and research collaboration agreement with kyowa hakko the kyowa hakko agreement for the development and commercialization in certain asian countries of a telomerase inhibitor for the treatment of cancer 
under the collaboration  kyowa hakko provides certain funding for the company s research and development activities and is responsible for all clinical  regulatory  manufacturing  marketing and sales efforts and expenses in the covered territory 
the kyowa hakko agreement provides that kyowa hakko will not pursue research and development independent of its collaboration with geron with respect to telomerase inhibition for the treatment of cancer in humans until april   at the earliest 
the kyowa hakko agreement also provides in general that  while geron exercises significant influence during the research phase  kyowa hakko exercises significant influence during the development and commercialization phases of the collaboration 
in march  the kyowa hakko agreement was amended to extend its term until april and to make certain other changes in connection with the signing of the pharmacia upjohn agreement as defined below 
on march  the company signed a license and research collaboration agreement the pharmacia upjohn agreement with pharmacia upjohn  spa to collaborate in the discovery  development and commercialization of a new class of anticancer drugs that inhibit telomerase 
under the collaboration  pharmacia upjohn will provide certain funding of the company s research and development activities and will be primarily responsible for all clinical  regulatory  manufacturing  marketing and sales efforts and expenses 
geron has certain promotion rights with corresponding clinical expense obligations 
as with the kyowa hakko agreement  the company exercises significant influence during the research phase of the collaboration while pharmacia upjohn will exercise significant influence during the development and commercialization phases of the collaboration 
through the pharmacia upjohn and kyowa hakko agreements  the company has granted to pharmacia upjohn and kyowa hakko exclusive worldwide rights to its telomerase inhibition technology  with exception to certain antisense  gene therapy and vaccine technologies outside asia  for the treatment of cancer in humans 
if and when a telomerase inhibitor is selected for development and commercialization under the agreements  the company will be significantly dependent upon the activities of pharmacia upjohn and kyowa hakko for the successful commercialization of such product 
any failure of pharmacia upjohn and kyowa hakko to develop or commercialize a telomerase inhibitor if and when selected will have a material adverse effect on the company 
in december  the company entered into a license  product and marketing agreement with boehringer mannheim to develop and market research and clinical diagnostic products to study and diagnose cancer on an exclusive  worldwide basis 
under the collaboration boehringer mannheim will provide reimbursement for research previously conducted and will be primarily responsible for all clinical  regulatory  manufacturing  marketing and sales efforts and expenses 
in addition  the company is entitled to receive future payments upon achievement of certain contractual milestones relating to level of product sales  as well as royalties on product sales 
further  the company has an option to exercise certain co promotion rights in the united states 
if and when a telomerase based diagnostic kit is developed and commercialized under the agreement with boehringer mannheim  the company will be significantly dependent upon the activities of boehringer mannheim for the successful manufacturing and commercialization of such product 
the company has also entered into licensing arrangements with several diagnostic companies for the company s telomerase detection technology 
however  because these licenses are limited to the research use only market  such arrangements are not expected to generate significant commercial revenues 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to negotiate additional strategic arrangements in the future on acceptable terms  if at all  or that such strategic arrangements will be successful 
in the absence of such arrangements  the company may encounter significant delays in introducing any product or find that the research  development  manufacture  marketing or sale of any product is adversely affected 
in the event that the company does not enter into such arrangements  it may be materially adversely affected 
the company has relationships with collaborators and scientific advisors at academic and other institutions  some of whom conduct research at the company s request 
these collaborators and scientific advisors are not employees of the company and may have commitments to  or consulting or advisory contracts with  other entities that may limit their availability to the company 
the company has limited control over the activities of these collaborators and advisors and  except as otherwise required by its collaboration and consulting agreements  can expect only limited amounts of their time to be dedicated to the company s activities 
dependence on proprietary technology and uncertainty of patent protection protection of the company s proprietary compounds and technology is important to the company s business 
the company owns eight issued united states patents and over united states patent applications and has licensed issued united states patents and over united states patent applications  as well as international filings under the patent cooperation treaty and pending foreign national patent applications corresponding to certain of these united states applications 
geron s success will depend in part on its ability to obtain and enforce its patents and maintain trade secrets  both in the united states and in other countries 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies  including the company  are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and technical questions for which legal principles are not firmly established 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to develop products or processes that are patentable or that patents will issue from any of the pending applications  including even allowed patent applications 
there can also be no assurance that the company s current patents  or patents that issue on pending applications  will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that the rights granted thereunder will provide proprietary protection or competitive advantages to the company 
because i patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy until patents issue  ii patent applications are not generally published until many months or years after they are filed and iii publication of technological developments in the scientific and patent literature often occurs long after the date of such developments  the company cannot be certain that the inventors on its or its licensors patents and patent applications were the first to invent the inventions disclosed in the patent applications or patents or that it or its licensors were the first to file patent applications for such inventions 
patent prosecution to issue patents and litigation to establish the validity of patents  to defend against patent infringement claims of others and to assert infringement claims against others can be expensive and time consuming even if the outcome is favorable to the company 
if the outcome of patent prosecution or litigation is unfavorable to the company  the company could be materially adversely affected 
patent law relating to the scope and enforceability of claims in the fields in which the company operates is still evolving 
the degree of future protection for the company s proprietary rights  therefore  is highly uncertain 
in this regard  there can be no assurance that independent patents will issue from each of the united states patent applications referenced above  which include many interrelated applications directed to common or related subject matter 
the company is aware of certain patent applications and patents that have been filed by others with respect to telomerase and telomere length technology 
in addition  there are a number of issued patents and pending applications owned by others directed to differential display  stem cell and other technologies relating to the company s research  development and commercialization efforts 
there can be no assurance that the company s technology can be developed and commercialized without a license to such patents or that such patent applications will not be granted priority over patent applications filed by the company or its licensors 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies to those of the company  duplicate any of the company s technologies or design around the patented technologies developed by the company or its licensors  any of which may have a material adverse effect on the company 
the commercial success of the company depends significantly on its ability to operate without infringing patents and proprietary rights of others 
there can be no assurance that the company s technologies do not and will not infringe the patents or proprietary rights of others 
in the event of such infringement  the company may be enjoined from pursuing research  development or commercialization of its potential products or may be required to obtain licenses to these patents or other proprietary rights or to develop or obtain alternative technologies 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain alternative technologies or any required license on commercially favorable terms  if at all  and if any such license is or alternative technologies are not obtained  the company may be delayed or prevented from pursuing the development of certain of its potential products 
the company s breach of an existing license or failure to obtain or delay in obtaining alternative technologies or a license to any technology that it may require to develop or commercialize its products may have a material adverse effect on the company 
also  the company may be subject to claims or litigation as a result of entering into a license 
in this regard  the company signed a licensing and sponsored research agreement relating to its primordial stem cell program with the johns hopkins university school of medicine jhu on august   after having been informed by a third party that the company and jhu would violate the rights of that third party and another academic institution with which that third party claimed to be affiliated by way of contract collectively third party in doing so 
after a review of the correspondence with the third party and jhu as well as related documents  including an issued us patent  the company believes that the third party s claims  if asserted  would fall into three general categories patent infringement  misuse of confidential information and breach of contract 
the company believes that it and jhu have substantial defenses to any claims that might be asserted by such third party and has provided indemnification to jhu relating to such potential claims 
however  any litigation resulting from this matter may divert significant resources  both financial and otherwise  from the company s research programs and there can be no assurance that the company would be successful in any such litigation 
if the outcome of any such litigation is unfavorable to the company  the company could be materially and adversely affected 
litigation may also be necessary to enforce any patents issued or licensed to the company or to determine the scope and validity of the company s or anthers proprietary rights 
the company could incur substantial costs if litigation is required to defend itself in patent suits or other intellectual property litigation brought by others or if geron initiates such suits 
there can be no assurance that the company s issued or licensed patents would be held valid or infringed in a court of competent jurisdiction or that a patent held by another will be held invalid or not infringed in such court 
an adverse outcome in litigation or an interference to determine priority or other proceeding in a court or patent office could subject the company to significant liabilities to other parties  require disputed rights to be licensed from other parties or require the company to cease using such technology  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
geron also relies on trade secrets to protect its proprietary technology  especially in circumstances in which patent protection is not believed to be appropriate or obtainable 
geron attempts to protect its proprietary technology in part by confidentiality agreements with its employees  consultants and certain contractors 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that the company would have adequate remedies for any breach  or that the company s trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors 
the company is party to various license agreements which give it rights to use certain technologies in its research  development and commercialization activities 
disputes have arisen and may continue to arise as to the inventorship and corresponding rights in know how and inventions resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by the company and its licensors  research collaborators and consultants 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to license such technologies on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  or to maintain the exclusivity of its exclusive licenses 
the failure of the company to maintain exclusive or other rights to such technologies could have a material adverse effect on the company 
future capital needs  uncertainty of additional funding the company will require substantial capital resources in order to conduct its operations 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  among others  continued scientific progress in its research and development programs  the magnitude and scope of these activities  the ability of the company to maintain and establish strategic arrangements for research  development  clinical testing  manufacturing and marketing  progress with preclinical and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims  or the potential for new technologies and products 
the company intends to seek such additional funding through strategic collaborations  public or private equity financings and capital lease transactions  however  there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
additional equity financings could result in significant dilution to stockholders 
further  in the event that additional funds are obtained through arrangements with collaborative partners  such arrangements may require the company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies  product candidates or products that the company would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize itself 
if sufficient capital is not available  the company may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of its research or development programs  each of which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
based on current projections  the company estimates that its existing capital resources including the proceeds from the private placement completed in march and payments under the pharmacia upjohn and kyowa hakko agreements  interest income  grant funding and equipment financing will be sufficient to fund its current and planned operations through there can be no assurance that the assumptions underlying such estimates are correct or that such funds will be sufficient to meet the capital needs of the company during such period 
history of operating losses  accumulated deficit geron has incurred net operating losses in every year of operation since its inception in losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with the company s research and development activities and from general and administrative costs associated with the company s operations 
the company expects to incur additional operating losses over the next several years as the company s research and development efforts and preclinical testing are expanded 
substantially all of the company s revenues to date have been research support payments under the collaborative agreements with kyowa hakko and pharmacia upjohn 
research support payments under the kyowa hakko agreement expire in april research payments under the pharmacia upjohn agreement expire in january the company is unable to estimate at this time the level of revenue to be received from the sale of diagnostic products  but does not expect to receive significant revenues from the sale of research use only kits 
the company s ability to achieve profitability is dependent on its ability  alone or with others  to select therapeutic compounds for development  obtain the required regulatory approvals and manufacture and market resulting products 
there can be no assurance when or if the company will receive material revenues from product sales or achieve profitability 
failure to generate significant additional revenues and achieve profitability could impair the company s ability to sustain operations 
substantial competition  risk of technological obsolescence the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive 
the company believes that certain pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies as well as certain research organizations currently engage in or have in the past engaged in efforts related to the biological mechanisms of cell aging and cell immortality  including the study of telomeres  telomerase and stem cell technologies 
in addition  other products and therapies that could compete directly with the products that the company is seeking to develop and market currently exist or are being developed by pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies  and by academic and other research organizations 
many companies are also developing alternative therapies to treat cancer and  in this regard  are competitive with the company 
the pharmaceutical companies developing and marketing such competing products have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development  manufacturing  preclinical and clinical testing  obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing than the company 
smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies 
academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research  seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research  clinical development and marketing of products similar to those of the company 
these companies and institutions compete with the company in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to the company s programs 
there is also competition for access to libraries of compounds to use for screening 
any inability of the company to secure and maintain access to sufficiently broad libraries of compounds for screening potential targets would have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition to the above factors  geron will face competition with respect to product efficacy and safety  the timing and scope of regulatory consents  availability of resources  reimbursement coverage  price and patent position  including potentially dominant patent positions of others 
there can be no assurance that competitors will not develop more effective or more affordable products  or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than the company or that such products will not render the company s products obsolete 
dependence on key personnel the company is highly dependent on the principal members of its scientific and management staff  the loss of whose services might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of research  development or business objectives 
in addition  the company relies on consultants and advisors  including the members of its scientific advisory board  to assist the company in formulating its research and development strategy 
retaining and attracting qualified scientific and management personnel  consultants and advisors is critical to the company s success 
the company faces competition for qualified individuals from numerous pharmaceutical  biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  as well as academic and other research institutions 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain such individuals on acceptable terms and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company 
ethical  legal and social implications of primoridal stem cell therapies the company s primordial stem cell program may involve the use of ps cells that would be derived from human embryonic tissue  and therefore may raise certain ethical  legal and social issues regarding the appropriate utilization of this tissue 
the use of embryonic tissue in scientific research is an issue of national interest 
many research institutions  including certain of the company s scientific collaborators  have adopted policies regarding the ethical use of these types of human tissue 
these policies may have the effect of limiting the scope of research conducted in this area  resulting in reduced scientific progress 
the company has established an ethics advisory board comprised of independent and recognized medical ethicists to provide advice to the company 
in addition  the united states government and its agencies currently do not fund research which involves the use of such tissue and may in the future regulate or otherwise restrict its use
