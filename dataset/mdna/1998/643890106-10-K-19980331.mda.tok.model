acquisition summary in november  necb created a second banking subsidiary when it acquired the equity bank eqbk 
in july  and august   respectively  the company acquired all the outstanding common stock of msb and fbwh  both of which were merged with and into nebt 
on december   necb acquired cmbk  establishing a third banking subsidiary 
with the exception of the fbwh acquisition  each of the transactions were accounted for as purchases and  as such  prior year comparative data was not revised to include information about either entity 
as previously noted  the acquisition of fbwh was accounted for as a pooling of interests and therefore all comparative prior periods have been restated as if the acquisition had been in effect for all periods presented 
on february   the company and olde port bank trust company opbt of portsmouth  new hampshire signed a definitive agreement under which the company will acquire opbt 
the merger is conditioned upon requisite bank regulatory approvals and the approval of shareholders of opbt as well as other customary conditions 
it is anticipated that the acquisition will be consummated in the second quarter of income statement analysis net interest income net interest income  which is defined as the difference between interest earned on earning assets and interest paid on deposits and borrowings  represents the largest component of necb s operating income 
the principal earning assets of the company are the loan portfolios of its subsidiary banks which are primarily comprised of loans to finance operations of businesses located within our market area  mortgage loans to finance the purchase or improvement of properties used by businesses and mortgage loans and personal loans to individuals 
representing approximately one quarter of the company s earning assets  necb s investment portfolio also plays an important part in the management of page the company s balance sheet 
these funds are used to provide reserves and meet the liquidity needs of the company while providing a source of revenue 
excess reserves are available to meet the borrowing needs of the communities we serve 
for the following discussion  interest income is presented on a fully taxable equivalent fte basis 
fte interest income restates reported interest income on tax exempt loans and securities as if such interest were taxed at the applicable state and federal income tax rates for all periods presented 
amounts in thousands years ended december  interest income financial statements    tax equivalent adjustment interest expense    net interest income fte    in  net interest income increased  or over the increase in is largely due to growth in earning assets which increased a substantial  or compared to the average 
the msb acquisition added approximately  to the average while internal growth provided the remainder 
the interest bearing liabilities acquired with msb added to interest costs while the combined effect of changes to interest rates of both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities served to decrease net interest income by  in page net interest margin and interest rate spread amounts in thousands interest interest interest average earned average earned average earned years ended december  balance paid rate balance paid rate balance paid rate assets interest earning assets federal funds sold    investment securities       loans a       total interest earning assets       allowance for loan losses    cash due from banks    other assets    total assets    liabilities and equity interest bearing liabilities regular savings deposits       now accounts    money market deposits    total savings deposits       time deposits       short term borrowings   long term debt   total interest bearing liabilities       demand deposits    other liabilities    total liabilities    equity    total liabilities equity    net interest income    net interest spread net interest margin a average loans include nonaccruing loans 
the net interest margin measures the difference in yield on  and the mix of  interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin is affected by a number of factors including the volume  pricing and maturity of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and interest rate fluctuations 
changes in nonperforming assets  together with interest lost and recovered on those assets also affect comparisons of net interest income 
the net interest margin for increased basis points to compared to in  primarily from an improved mix of earning assets which were funded by a greater percentage of interest free liabilities 
investment securities represented of average earning assets in compared to in while characteristically higher yielding loans represented and of average earning assets in and  respectively 
average earning asset mix insert pie chart securities loans other page average interest bearing liabilities increased to  in  from  in  primarily due to the acquisition of msb 
the interest rates paid on these liabilities decreased basis points and averaged in compared to in average total savings deposits increased  in compared to reflecting an increasingly competitive market for core deposits the interest rate paid on these deposits rose basis points in to from in more than offsetting this increase was a decrease in the cost of time deposits 
through the increased use of repurchase agreements for its commercial customers and the greater use of federal home loan bank of boston fhlbb borrowings  necb significantly expanded its use of alternative funding sources in short term borrowings increased markedly in and averaged  compared to  in  as increased use of repurchase agreements was used to meet necb s funding requirements 
in addition to providing a source of funds  repurchase agreements allow necb s commercial deposit customers to earn interest on excess cash balances 
with the majority of the increase in short term borrowings occurring in repurchase agreements which paid an average of in  the rate paid on short term liabilities decreased from and equaled 
as noted  during necb increased its long term debt with advances from the fhlbb 
necb s borrowings were fixed rate and had maturities ranging from to years 
in addition  fbwh had loans with maturities ranging from to years 
the cost of these liabilities were virtually unchanged and equaled in compared to in rate volume analysis changes in net interest income between years is divided into two components the change resulting from the change in average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities or volume and the change in the rates earned or paid on these balances 
the change in interest income and interest expense attributable to changes in both volume and rate  which cannot be segregated  has been allocated proportionately to the absolute values of the changes due to volume and rate 
the following table is presented on a fte basis 
amounts in thousands change due to change due to increase change in increase change in years ended december  decrease rate volume decrease rate volume interest earning assets federal funds sold investment securities   loans      total interest income change     interest bearing liabilities regular savings deposits now account deposits money market deposits total savings deposits time deposits   short term borrowings long term debt total interest expense change     net interest income change     as is shown above  the majority of the increase in net interest income in both and is attributable to changes in volume which is primarily the result of the acquisitions accounted for as purchases 
noteworthy in the above analysis is the  decrease in interest income on the loan portfolio 
as noted above  increased market competition for new loans has had the double effect of increasing origination expense eg  marketing and increased pricing pressure 
this taken together with a stable interest rate environment has served to reduce the yield on loans by basis points in also noteworthy in is the pick up in rates paid on interest bearing savings deposits in particularly in commercial deposits and the decrease in rates paid on time deposits 
page noninterest income necb s income from noninterest revenue activities increased a strong in and represented of net revenues compared to in the increase in fee based revenue follows industry trends of the past several years for shifting dependence away from interest sources of income 
through the expansion of existing business lines and the introduction of new products and services  necb s objective is to increase the percentage of income derived from noninterest income sources to at least of total net revenue within the next two years 
for noninterest income increased from and totaled  compared to  and  for and  respectively 
service charges  fees and commissions increased and totaled  in compared to  in included in service charges  fees and commissions are fees on deposits  loan servicing fees and other fees and charges 
while much of this increase resulted from the msb acquisition  strong increases in deposit related fees also helped fuel the increase 
for example  aided by widespread consumer acceptance  the company s debit card program mastermoney tm continues to grow dramatically with revenue increasing by almost from also key to the increase in deposit related fees is necb s cash management program access 
while still producing a modest amount of revenue for the company  the program reflects necb s ongoing effort to seek out opportunities for increasing fee income producing sources of revenue 
benefiting from the strong equities market  necb realized gains from the sale of securities of  in this compares to significantly smaller amounts recorded in both and as a matter of practice  in conjunction with the of purchase common stock  necb establishes a target price objective for the issue 
in addition  through regular reviews of holdings  necb evaluates each stock and determines whether to sell or continue to hold the stock 
it is the sale of those issues which reached their target prices during which provided approximately  in gains in the likelihood of profitability of any such gains in the future cannot be predicted 
gains on sales of loans decreased by  and totaled  for compared to  for the acquisition of fbwh in mid  brought with it a small but successful department specializing in the sba guaranteed lending program 
while it had been fbwh s practice to sell the guaranteed portion in the secondary market  necb chose to retain all new production for its own portfolio 
management is confident that foregoing the gain on the sale of these loans is outweighed by the continuing return from the ownership of these assets 
saw the company increase its production of mortgages originated for sale by  from  in to  in the increase is largely due to i the company s expanded market area  ii participation in a wider variety of loan programs  and iii a very favorable interest rate environment

mortgage origination s amounts in thousands noninterest expense total noninterest expense was  in compared to  in the increase of  included non recurring acquisition related expenses of  in excluding these charges  noninterest expenses increased by  or over the  reported in much of the increase in is due to our expansion into the manchester market 
the use of purchase accounting for the acquisition of msb increased expenses in categories such as salary and benefit expense  occupancy and equipment 
msb s expenses net of cost savings achieved in the acquisition increased expenses for the second half of and all of this step up in expense aggregated to approximately  in and  in the largest component of the noninterest expense salaries and benefits totaled  in compared to  in the increase is primarily due to the acquisitions along with other salary and benefit increases 
equipment totaled  in which is  or higher than the  in the increase is related to higher lease expense related to upgrades in the data and item processing activities performed in the company s technology center 
during  necb migrated to an image based system for generating customer statements 
from the goodwill recorded in connection with the eqbk and msb acquisitions  intangible asset amortization increased  from other expenses increased by  and totaled  compared to  in page reflecting necb s growth  marketing expense increased from sponsorships eg  new england blizzard and other promotions related to new business initiatives undertaken in income taxes in  the company recognized income tax expense of  an effective tax rate of 
this compares to income tax expense of  in  an effective rate of 
the increase in the effective tax rate is attributable to a reduction in the valuation reserve for deferred tax assets 
balance sheet analysis total assets increased to  at december  compared to  at december  the  in loans and  in deposits the company acquired in connection with the cmbk acquisition is primarily responsible for the increased asset size

management s strategy for investment securities is to maintain a very high quality portfolio with short and intermediate maturities 
investment securities classified as available for sale provide an additional source of liquidity to meet the needs of necb and its customers 
the net unrealized gain on securities available for sale increased to  at december  compared to  at december  the  improvement is attributable to declining interest rates and the strong performance in the stock market during loans at december   necb s loan portfolio stood at  compared to  a year earlier 
beyond the effect of the cmbk acquisition and despite the intense competition in the marketplace  necb was able to add significantly to loans outstanding in through loans to small businesses for the financing of facilities and other business purposes  necb s lending officers increased loans outstanding by an additional  or in in addition  the favorable interest rate environment coupled with a strong economy helped fuel new home construction which enabled necb to grow its real estate construction loan portfolio by in from  at december  to  at december  as the preferred small business lender in its service area together with necb s expansion into the bristol market and a strengthening economy  loans outstanding should continue to increase 
amounts in thousands loan portfolio composition commercial and financial   real estate construction   residential   commercial   consumer   page a certain degree of credit risk is inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
credit risk is managed through the company s credit function  which is designed to insure adherence to a high level of credit standards 
necb s credit function provides a system of checks and balances for necb s credit related activities by establishing and monitoring all credit related policies and practices within necb and insuring their uniform application 
these activities are designed to provide i for a thorough analysis of applications for credit  ii continuous examinations of both outstanding and delinquent loans  and  iii an appropriate level of loan diversification 
necb endeavors to identify potential problem loans early  to take charge offs promptly based upon realistic assessment of likely losses and to maintain adequate reserves for possible loan losses 
in addition to being diversified by borrower  as shown in the table below  the company s portfolio is diversified by industry and product 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets npas are assets on which income recognition in the form of principal and or interest has either ceased or is limited  thereby reducing the company s earnings 
maintaining a low level of npas is important to the ongoing success of necb 
the company s comprehensive credit review and approval process is critical to the ability to minimize npas on a long term basis 
in addition to the negative impact on net interest income and credit losses  npas also increase operating expenses due to the costs associated with collection efforts 
npas include nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned oreo 
generally  loans are placed in nonaccrual status when they are past due greater than ninety days or the repayment of interest or principal is considered to be in doubt 
oreo consists of properties acquired through foreclosure proceedings 
these properties are recorded at the lower of the carrying value of the related loans or the estimated fair market value less estimated selling costs 
charges to the allowance for loan losses are made to reduce the carrying amount of loans to the fair market value of the properties less estimated selling expenses upon reclassification as oreo 
subsequent reductions  if needed  are charged to operating income 
in addition to npas  the asset quality of the company can be measured by the amount of the provision  charge offs and several credit quality ratios presented in the discussion concerning provision and allowance for loan losses 
necb s npas at december  through are presented below amounts in thousands nonaccrual loans      other real estate owned      total nonperforming assets      npas increased  or to  at december  from  at december  at december  nonaccrual loans as a percentage of total loans and nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets were and  respectively  compared to and at december  the increase in total npas in the year ended december  primarily resulted from the cmbk acquisition which added  in npas

provision and allowance for loan losses necb s allowance for loan losses represents amounts available for future credit losses 
management continually assesses the adequacy of their allowances for loan losses in response to current and anticipated economic conditions  specific problem loans  historical net charge offs and the overall risk profile of their loan portfolios 
management allocates specific allowances to individual problem loans based upon its analysis of the potential for loss perceived to exist related to such loans 
in addition to the specific allowances for individual loans  a portion of the allowance is maintained as a general allowance 
the amount of the general allowance is determined through management s analysis of the potential for loss inherent in those loans not considered problem loans 
among the factors considered by management in this analysis are the number and type of loans  nature and amount of collateral pledged to secure such loans and current economic conditions 
the allowance for loan losses is not a precise amount but is derived from judgments based on the above factors 
the following table summarizes the activity in the allowance for possible loan losses for the years ended december  through the allowance is maintained at a level consistent with identified loss potential and the perceived risk in the portfolio 
it is not considered meaningful to allocate the allowance according to geographic area as necb s market area is homogeneous and limited in size

page the following table reflects the allowance for loan losses as of december  with allocations categorized by loan type amounts in thousands allocation of percentage of allowance for loan type to loans by type loan losses total loans commercial financial  real estate construction residential  commercial  consumer total  as noted  necb s subsidiaries perform ongoing reviews of loans to determine the required allowance for possible loan losses at any given date 
to facilitate this process  an individual loan rating system is utilized 
in the review process  the subsidiaries assess factors including the borrower s past and current financial condition  repayment ability and liquidity  the nature of collateral and changes in its value  current and anticipated economic conditions and other factors deemed appropriate 
these reviews are dependent upon estimates  appraisals and judgments which can change quickly because of changing economic conditions and management s perception as to how these factors affect the financial condition of debtors 
the loan rating process classifies loans according to the subsidiaries uniform classification system 
the subsidiaries consider performing loans rated as substandard and doubtful to be potential problem loans 
substandard loans are characterized by well defined weaknesses such as deteriorating or inadequate collateral or impaired repayment ability 
a loan is considered doubtful when similar conditions exist but are more severe in nature 
at december   necb considered loans outstanding of  to be potential problems compared to  at december  included in these totals were loans totaling  and  respectively  which were not classified as nonperforming because such loans are performing according to their terms 
deposits total deposits increased  or from  at december  to  at december  this increase is largely attributable to the acquisition of cmbk which provided  in deposits 
as discussed earlier  by utilizing fhlb as an alternative source of funding interest earning assets  necb decreased its reliance upon retail deposits particularly cd s as a funding source 
this taken together with a declining interest rate environment served to reduce rates paid on cd s by more than basis points in compared to the implementation of this strategy had a significant effect upon renewing cd s acquired in acquisitions 
for example  the interest rate structure of msb was at or near the top end of the rates offered throughout its market 
this often attracted funds from depositors who only sought the highest rates then being offered 
while time deposits remain an important source of funds  much of this money did not stay with the company 
as a result  absent the effect of the acquisition  time deposits would have decreased by approximately  from through its commercial focus  necb continues to target small businesses as a source of growth 
this focus helped shift the mix of deposits from the higher priced time deposits to noninterest bearing demand deposits and now accounts 
the percentage of noninterest bearing demand deposits to total deposits increased to from at december  and  respectively 
interest rate risk the asset liability management process at necb provides for a structured process for ensuring that the risk to earnings from changes in interest rates is prudently managed 
the goal of the asset liability management process is to manage the balance sheet to provide maximum level of earnings while maintaining a high quality balance sheet and acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk 
sensitivity of earnings to interest rate changes occur when yields on assets change differently from the interest costs on liabilities 
to mitigate this interest rate risk  the structure of the balance sheet is managed so that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities are highly correlated and produce an adequate level of earnings even in periods of volatile interest rates 
key to necb s management of interest rate risk are the following measurement techniques i interest rate sensitivity gap analysis  ii rate shock to measure earnings volatility due to immediate increase or decrease in market page rates of up to basis points  and iii simulations of net interest income under alternative balance sheet and interest rate scenarios 
to further improve the company s ability to manage interest rate risk  necb uses computer modeling software for its measuring and monitoring process 
using computer modeling  necb is able to measure the sensitivity of earnings to interest rate changes 
necb s subsidiaries measure the impact assuming the continuation of current balance sheet trends along with a rate shock 
necb also uses the model to measure its earnings sensitivity relative to management s most likely interest rate scenario 
in conjunction with the installation of the modeling software  the company refined its internal parameters for monitoring gap analysis and the basis point rate shock as well as the assumptions as to the effect of volume changes  prepayment rates and repricing characteristics for both contractual and noncontractual assets and liabilities 
these guidelines serve as benchmarks for  determining actions to balance the current position against the subsidiaries strategic goals 
the results of the simulations are reported to the respective subsidiary asset liability committee alco 
gap analysis provides a point in time snapshot of the maturity and repricing characteristics of the company s balance sheet 
the report  which follows  is prepared by allocating all assets and liabilities into time horizons based upon either their contractual or anticipated maturity or repricing 
for floating rate instruments  the entire balance is placed at the next date on which their rates could be reset and for fixed rate instruments the balances are placed in time horizon according to their principal repayment schedule 
in addition to prepayment assumptions for mortgage related instruments  management also applies assumptions to noncontractual deposits such as demand deposits and savings accounts 
the interest sensitivity gap is determined by subtracting the amount of liabilities from the amount of assets that reprice in a particular time interval 
a liability sensitive position results when more liabilities than assets reprice or mature within a given time period 
under this scenario  as interest rates fall  increased net interest revenue will be generated 
conversely  an asset sensitive position results when more assets than liabilities reprice with a given period 
in such an instance  net interest revenue would benefit from an increasing interest rate environment 
the impact of creating a liability or asset sensitive position depends on the magnitude of the actual change in interest rates relative to the behavior of borrowers and depositors 
necb s policy specifies that the cumulative one year gap should be less than of total assets 
as is shown in the table below  as of december   the company was liability sensitive at the cumulative one year gap  well within necb s policy limits 
interest rate gap analysis december  cumulatively repriced within amounts in thousands  by repricing date months to to after or less months years years total cash and cash equivalents   securities      loans      loans held for sale   other assets   total assets      deposits demand      savings      time     total deposits      borrowings     other liabilities   equity   total liabilities and shareholders equity      periodic     cumulative gap    cumulative gap as of total assets through both the modeling process and the complementary gap analysis  management believes that the exposure of the company s income to either a rate shock or gradual change in interest rates is modest 
page liquidity risk management s objective for liquidity risk is to ensure the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to meet their cash flow obligations and to capitalize on business opportunities on a timely and cost effective basis 
these cash flow obligations include the withdrawal of deposits on demand or at maturity  the repayment of borrowings as they mature and the ability to fund existing and new loan commitments 
accordingly  necb s subsidiaries have liquidity policies which provide flexibility to meet cash needs 
the liquidity objective is achieved through the maintenance of readily marketable investment securities as well as a balanced flow of asset maturities  prudent pricing on loan and deposit products and the sale of mortgage loans in the secondary market 
liquidity at necb is measured and monitored daily  enabling management to identify and respond to trends occurring in the company s balance sheet 
all of necb s subsidiary banks are members of the federal home loan bank of boston fhlbb making them eligible for both short term lines of credit and long term borrowing facilities 
the fhlbb provides its member banks with credit by accepting as collateral the member bank s mortgage assets 
the aggregate credit available to the subsidiaries consists of  short term and  in long term 
at december   usage of these facilities amounted to  providing  available for future use 
necb has alternative sources of liquidity available including federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements 
purchases of federal funds and borrowing on repurchase agreements may be utilized to meet short term borrowing needs 
necb believes that its policies will enable it to maintain adequate liquidity and to prudently commit funds to loans or investments  depending upon underlying risk  demand and rate of return 
as shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows  necb s cash and cash equivalents at december  was virtually unchanged from december  totaling  and  respectively

the year problem necb  like all institutions that utilize computer technology  is facing challenges associated with the inability of many existing computer systems to process time sensitive data accurately beyond the year referred to as the year problem 
the year problem is the result of computer programs using two digits rather than four in date fields that define the year 
any computer programs used by necb that have time sensitive software may recognize a date field using as the year rather than the year if not modified or replaced  these programs could cause system failures or miscalculations  which could adversely affect necb s ability to process customer transactions or provide customer service 
necb has conducted a comprehensive review of its computer systems to identify all systems that could be affected by the year problem and developed a comprehensive project management process to modify or replace all affected systems and test them for year compliance 
necb relies upon third party providers for its computer software 
necb is monitoring the activities of its providers to ensure that appropriate development and implementation plans to address the year problem are in place 
necb has taken steps to identify alternative vendors in the event that one or more of these providers fail to become year compliant 
while necb expects its year plan to be completed on a timely basis to allow for adequate testing in late and  there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which necb s systems may rely also will be completed in a timely fashion 
in addition  necb exchanges data with a number of other entities  such as credit bureaus and governmental entities 
the failure of these entities to adequately to address the year problem could adversely affect necb s ability to conduct its business 
costs associated with modifying existing system applications have been and will continue to be expensed as incurred 
necb does not expect incremental costs associated with any modifications for year compliance to be material
