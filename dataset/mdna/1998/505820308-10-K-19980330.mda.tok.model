results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the years ended december  and  gross revenues decreased from million to million  a decrease of million or 
the decrease was primarily due to the lady luck rhythm blues country casino complex s revenues and operating results being materially adversely affected  during the third quarter of  by a temporary closure by the arkansas department of transportation of the helena bridge which provides the principle access from its primary customer market 
other causes of the decrease include i two closures of lady luck natchez for a total of approximately days due to flooding on the mississippi river and adverse weather conditions which closings also caused lingering disruptive effects for a period after each reopening  ii declines in table games revenues at each wholly owned subsidiary due to decreases in the amounts wagered at each of these properties and decreases in the percentage of wagers won by lady luck natchez and lady luck biloxi  iii the addition of two competitive casinos and a significant number of hotel rooms by mli s competitors  iv a deteriorating local economy in natchez  mississippi and decreasing customer headcounts at llm  v a growing disparity in relation to its competitors in the amenities which llb is able to offer its customers such as on site hotel rooms for table games players  and vi operational changes and an absence of capital improvements at llcc in addition to increased competition from certain nearby casinos 
the effects of these items were partially offset by i an increase in the company s equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates  ii a full year of operation of country casino adjacent to lady luck rhythm blues in which had opened on may   iii an increase in llb s slot machine revenues due to an increase in the amounts wagered  iv llm s purchase of the river park hotel on april   and v mli s acquisition of the room riverbluff hotel in helena  arkansas on july  access to the lady luck rhythm blues country casino complex s two casinos  hotel and pavilion was severely restricted from july  through august  on july   a barge with a large boom attachment hit the helena bridge which crosses the mississippi river and connects arkansas and mississippi 
the resulting structural damage to the bridge caused the arkansas department of transportation to close the bridge until august  the bridge provides access to mli s arkansas customers upon which it is highly dependent 
gross revenues of lady luck rhythm blues country casino complex since the bridge s reopening indicate a successful recovery evidenced by a increase in its gross revenues for the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of the adverse effects during the bridge s closure were partially offset by a full year of operation of country casino in which had opened may  the net effect of these changes and the addition of competitive facilities described more fully below resulted in gross revenues at the lady luck rhythm blues country casino complex decreasing to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
mli s largest area of decrease during these comparative years was table games 
primarily due to decreases in the amounts wagered on table games  gross table games revenues decreased million for the year ended december  from the prior year 
this decrease was offset partially by an increase in food and beverage revenues of  primarily due to increased food and beverage furnished to customers as complimentaries 
these increases in complimentaries were a necessary response to the additional competitor facilities added in as described above 
slot machine  table games and food and beverage revenues decreased million  million and  or  and  respectively  at lady luck natchez during the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
in addition to the adverse effects of flooding on the mississippi river and other adverse weather conditions  which twice closed its operations for a total of approximately days during the year ended december  and caused lingering disruptive effects for a period after each reopening  these decreases were due to a deteriorating local economy in natchez  mississippi 
the decreases in gross casino revenues  while primarily due to decreases in the amounts wagered  were also due to declines in the win percentages from to the amounts wagered may have also decreased in part due to fewer rooms  food and beverage furnished to customers on a complimentary basis during the comparative periods 
this decrease in complimentary food and beverage was a significant factor in the decline in gross food and beverage revenues 
lady luck bilox s gross revenues increased  during the year ended december  compared to this increase occurred primarily between the three month periods ended march  and march  during which time an increase in the average number of slot machines and a increase in the average daily net win per slot machine increased lady luck biloxi s slot machine revenues by million 
this increase in slot machine revenues was primarily a result of increased marketing expenditures and increased food and beverage furnished as complimentaries to customers during that time 
the increase in slot machine revenues was offset partially by decreases in table game revenues each quarter during the year ended december  compared to the respective prior year quarters 
these declines in table games revenues were primarily due to decreases in total amounts wagered which has been caused in part due to a growing disparity in the amenities which llb is able to offer its customers in relation to its competitors  some of which are able to offer on site hotel rooms and entertainment 
llb experienced a significant decrease in gross revenues since the opening of additional competitive facilities in its market  principally the opening of imperial palace in december  which competitive trend is expected to continue 
llcc s slot machine revenues declined million between the years ended december  and this decrease was due to both a decrease in the total amount wagered on slot machines and a decrease in the related win percentage 
during these comparative periods  llcc s total amount wagered on slot machines decreased 
llcc s decreases were due in part to operational changes  an absence of capital improvements at the facility and increased competition from certain nearby casinos 
subsequent to december  and effective february   llcc sold its real property and substantially all operating assets to the holder of its mortgage note in exchange for forgiveness of the note which  as of december   had a  balance 
the sale resulted in a loss of  recognized during  including reserves for certain remaining real property leases 
the company s equity in net income of the bettendorf joint venture increased  or  during the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
this increase is primarily due to a increase in slot machine revenues 
the bettendorf joint venture s increase in slot machine revenues was due to an increase in both the average daily net win per slot machine and the average number of slot machines in operation as further described in the tables that follow below 
the company s equity in net income of the bally s joint venture increased  during the nine month period ended september  the effective date the company s partnership interest was sold to bally s compared to the year ended december  as the interest was sold during  a comparison of results between years is not meaningful 
furthermore  the company s equity in net income for the year ended december  reflects a million deduction for the company s share of pre opening expenses while none were recognized during the nine month period ended september  casino operating expenses company wide as a percentage of casino revenues increased from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december   primarily due to the following i severe access restrictions at the lady luck rhythm blues country casino complex  the temporary closings of lady luck natchez and the decreases in casino revenues from most gaming areas of the company s other wholly owned subsidiaries which caused fixed costs and certain variable costs which could not immediately be eliminated to be spread over a lower revenue base  ii a increase in the cost of complimentary rooms  food and beverage furnished to casino customers in relation to casino revenues  iii an increase in table games payroll expense at each property in relation to table games revenue  and iv increases in slot machine rentals  slot department special events and cash incentives for slot machine players in relation to slot revenues 
food and beverage costs and expenses  prior to reclassifying the cost of complementaries  as a percentage of related revenues increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   due to an increase in labor costs at lady luck natchez and increases in the cost of sales in relation to revenues at each property 
these increases were offset partially by a decrease in labor costs in relation to revenues at the rhythm blues country casino complex 
gross room revenues for the river park hotel and the riverbluff hotel increased and  respectively  and decreased for the room hotel adjacent to lady luck rhythm blues during years ended december  compared with the prior year 
however  these comparisons are not for equivalent periods because llm purchased the river park hotel on april   mli acquired the room riverbluff hotel in helena  arkansas on july  and access to mli s room hotel adjacent to lady luck rhythm blues was temporarily restricted during the current year period as described above 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total gross revenues remained a constant during the years ended december  and a significant reduction in rent paid by the rhythm blues country casino complex was offset by increases in casino marketing expenditures at mli  llm and llb primarily related to direct mail  other advertising or promotions and group sales  and increases in facility expenses at mli for utilities  security  insurance and property taxes 
mli s increase in facility expense was primarily due to the addition of country casino 
rent paid by mli decreased because percentage rents under the lease during the current year were reduced due to the temporary access restriction 
in addition  rent was greater during the five month period ended may  compared to the corresponding current year period due to an additional fixed monthly rental expense of  which was required to be paid prior to the opening of country casino on may  subsequent to may   the fixed rent was replaced with a percentage rent which has been less than the fixed rent 
operating loss income was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition to the changes described above  this million decrease in operating income was due to the following i million reserve in for the loss on the sale of assets as described below  ii project development cost write downs and reserves in of million as described below  iii a million asset impairment write down in as described below  iv a million loss on the sale of investment in unconsolidated affiliate in as described below  v a million increase in depreciation expense during the current year primarily related to the acquisition of the river park hotel and riverbluff hotel and the opening of country casino and the pavilion each during  and  vi decreased hotel operating margins 
the effects of these items were partially offset by the following i a  reduction in litigation claims  ii a  decrease in related party management fees from lower operating results during the current year  and iii the absence of  of pre opening expense which was recognized during in conjunction with the opening of country casino and the pavilion 
effective february   llcc sold substantially all of its real property and operating assets to the holder of its mortgage note in exchange for forgiveness of the million note and the assumption of certain liabilities 
during  the company recorded a reserve of million to write down the assets held for sale to fair market value less closing costs  to reserve for operating losses in prior to the effective sale date and to reserve for estimated future lease payments and write downs on its parking lot leases which were not assumed by the purchaser of the assets sold 
an agreement has been reached  pursuant to an existing gaming equipment lease  to sell to the bettendorf joint venture the gaming equipment that the venture has been leasing from the company since april the gaming equipment will be sold for its negotiated value of  as of december  the  reserve for loss on sale of assets represents the net book value in excess of negotiated value as of december  the sale is effective january  during  the company wrote down various project development costs totaling approximately million due to changes in regulatory  political and competitive environments and other factors 
the first write down related to the missouri project 
the state of missouri investigates applicants at its discretion and there can be no assurance that the company s application will be actively reviewed in future periods 
in november  the missouri supreme court ruled that several existing missouri gaming projects are illegal due to their locations not being upon the mississippi or missouri rivers 
in addition  certain current operators in missouri have been experiencing poor operating results 
these uncertainties have resulted in the company recording a million project development write down in related to the missouri project of the remaining balance of its pre opening and other development costs and a million write down of construction in progress for a portion of the partially completed cruising vessel which  if not used for the missouri project  could be sold or possibly used in a future development project 
these valuations are based on assumptions regarding expected future economic  market and gaming regulatory conditions 
changes in these assumptions could result in further changes in the estimated net realizable value of the partially completed cruising vessel 
the second write down was related to the vicksburg project 
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the agreements are subject to the fulfillment of several conditions the conditions  including but not limited to  the partners future agreement as to the scope and cost of the project  required regulatory approval  and completion of project financing 
the horseshoe joint venture agreement may be terminated by llv or horseshoe as of april  the termination date if the conditions are not satisfied or waived as of the termination date or without cause 
the company does not believe that all of the conditions will be satisfied prior to the termination date 
while the company does not currently intend to terminate the horseshoe joint venture agreement  there can be no assurance that llv or horseshoe will not terminate the horseshoe joint venture agreement 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that if consummated  that the joint venture will be successful 
additionally  a determination that certain assets may not be usable in the vicksburg project as currently contemplated resulted in a million write off of construction in progress 
management s estimate of net realizable value is based upon assumptions regarding future economic  market and gaming regulatory conditions including the viability of the vicksburg site for the development of a casino project 
changes in these assumptions could result in changes in the estimated net realizable value of the property 
additionally  the company had previously planned to construct and operate a casino in gulfport  mississippi the gulfport project 
however  due to increased competition in the gulfport gaming market  in the company suspended further development of the gulfport project and is not currently engaged in negotiating either an agreement to sell or develop these leaseholds 
the company intends to cancel these leases at the earliest date allowable pursuant to the lease agreements 
during  the company provided a project development reserve of approximately  to fully reserve remaining future minimum lease payments net of estimated sublease rentals for the remaining llg leases 
reserves of approximately  and  had previously been provided during and  respectively 
lastly  during  the company provided reserves of approximately  related to its investment in lady luck new mexico llnm for a total reserve related to llnm  including and reserves  of approximately  the company received  cash during the year for its remaining investment balance 
the company evaluated the recoverability of llb s long lived assets in due to recurring operating losses 
based on the criteria established under financial accounting standards board statement no 
sfas  the company continued to evaluate llb s long lived assets for impairment 
during the fourth quarter of december   pursuant to sfas the company recorded an asset impairment write down of million 
the company considered the marginal historical operating results and the significant downturn in the operating results of llb since the opening of additional competitive facilities in its market  principally the opening of imperial palace in december  an indicator of impairment 
in performing its review for recoverability  the company compared the projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of llb s long lived assets 
the net carrying value of llb s long lived assets before write down were million at december  as the net carrying value of long lived assets exceeded the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  the company was required to recognize an impairment loss and write down long lived assets to their fair market value of million 
fair value became the new cost basis for the impaired assets and previously accumulated depreciation was eliminated 
as active market quotations were not available  the company measured fair value by discounting estimated cash flows 
considerable management judgment was necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows 
accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from such estimates 
the company entered an agreement effective september  to sell its minority interest in bally s saloon  gambling hall and hotel in tunica  mississippi to hilton hotels corporation  the majority owner and manager of the property 
the sale resulted in a loss of  which represents the difference between the sales price and the net investment in the bally s joint venture and related assets 
in  the company had provided a reserve of  relating to its investment in the bally s joint venture 
the net loss applicable to common stockholders was million or per share for the year ended december  compared with net income applicable to common stockholders of million or per share for the year ended december  this million or per share decrease in net income applicable to common stockholders was primarily due to the following i the million decrease in operating income as described above  a  decrease in other non operating income  iii a  increase in preferred stock dividends caused by compounding return on dividends not paid in cash  iv a  increase in net interest expense due primarily to a decrease in interest capitalized in the current year  and v a  decrease in interest income due to greater cash invested in the prior year before the opening of country casino 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the company s gross revenues increased from million in to million during  an increase of million or 
the opening of country casino adjacent to lady luck rhythm blues in coahoma county  mississippi  the acquisition of the room river park hotel in natchez  mississippi  the opening of the casino at the company s joint venture with bally s in robinsonville  mississippi  and the opening of lady luck bettendorf  in bettendorf  iowa  improvements in its operations and income from leasing a gaming vessel and certain equipment to lady luck bettendorf were primarily responsible for this increase in the company s gross revenues  over the prior year 
lady luck rhythm blues generated million of the company s overall million increase in gross revenues 
a increase in the average number of slot machines partially offset by a decrease in the average daily net win per slot machine accounted for million of lady luck rhythm blues increase in gross revenues 
country casino  which opened may   increased the average number of slot machines in operation and decreased the average daily net win per slot machine significantly 
in addition  increased competition from the casinos in tunica  mississippi  during the second half of had a significant adverse effect on average daily net win per slot machine 
these changes  when analyzed quarterly  indicate  for the first quarter of  an approximately consistent average daily net win per slot machine while the average number of slot machines in operation increased by  and for the nine months ended december   a increase in the average number of slot machines in operation partially offset by a decrease in the average daily net win per slot machine 
increases in food and beverage  hotel and other revenues offset partially by a decrease in table and card games revenues accounted for the balance of the increase in gross revenues at lady luck rhythm blues 
llm s gross revenues increased million in compared to llm acquired and took over operation of the room best western river park hotel in natchez  mississippi on april  during the period from april  through december   the hotel s gross room revenues were million

food and beverage gross revenues increased from million in to million in  an increase of million or  including a increase in complimentary food and beverage revenues 
this increase was also due to higher customer counts and additional outlets at the lady luck rhythm blues country casino complex  improvements at lady luck natchez and the addition of outlets at the river park hotel  and was offset partially by changes in outlets at lady luck biloxi 
food and beverage costs and expenses  prior to reclassifying the cost of complimentaries  as a percentage of related revenues declined from for to for  continuing a trend of lowering costs of sales and labor expenses as a percentage of food and beverage revenues which was partially offset by the costs associated with outlet changes at lady luck biloxi

related party management license fees decreased from million during to million during  a decrease of million or 
this decrease was due to the company entering into the new marketing agreements in replacement of the old management agreements as described above offset partially by certain abatements totaling  deducted in from the management license fees the company received from the bettendorf joint venture 
in addition  under the new marketing agreements  the brdc obligation and management license fee overhead costs totaling million are included in selling  general and administrative expense for  while  in  the cost of these items was the responsibility of related parties  wholly owned by mr

certain risks and uncertainties llgc  through its subsidiaries and affiliates  owns and operates gaming casinos in mississippi and iowa and intends to develop projects in missouri and vancouver  british columbia 
the entities owning such casinos and any entities owning casinos in the future are or will be required to obtain and maintain certain gaming licenses from the applicable state regulatory authorities and comply with certain regulations with respect thereto 
although the company believes it is in material compliance with all applicable gaming regulations  non compliance by the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
generally  regulatory authorities have broad discretion in granting  renewing and revoking gaming licenses 
llgc itself is required to be found suitable to own the entities directly or indirectly owning such casinos 
in addition  the company s directors and many of the employees of such casinos are required to obtain gaming licenses 
where it has not already done so  the company intends to apply for such licenses and to have its employees  to the extent required  apply for such licenses 
all directors and executive officers of the company have received all necessary approvals with respect to the operating casinos and have received  applied for or will apply for all necessary approvals with respect to the development stage projects and the pre development stage project 
while the company has received certain gaming licenses in the states of mississippi  colorado and iowa  the company has not received licenses in any other jurisdiction 
there can be no assurances that each casino  officer  director  or the appropriate gaming employees will receive where such has not yet been received or maintain the necessary gaming licenses  or that the company or its casinos will be able to operate successfully or profitably under the terms of any such licenses 
the failure of the company or any of its key personnel to obtain or retain a license in a particular jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to obtain or retain licenses in other jurisdictions 
there is a substantial risk that the supply of gaming facilities in mississippi will exceed the demand for gaming  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
as a result of increased competition including the opening of another competing casino in december in biloxi  lady luck biloxi became unprofitable on an operating basis causing revenues to decline significantly since that time 
in addition  desoto county  the northwestern most mississippi county and nearest to memphis  could  under existing state law  vote to authorize gaming activities which would increase competition 
the voters of desoto county have voted against legalized gaming on three occasions  most recently in november  however  local referenda can be held during presidential election years  and no assurance can be given that gaming will not be approved in desoto county in future elections 
additionally  in arkansas  a gaming referendum  which  if passed  would have legalized certain forms of gaming at certain locations  was defeated in november of if gaming were legalized in certain areas of arkansas or  to a lesser extent  in desoto county  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s coahoma county facilities which generate a significant portion of the company s consolidated revenues and operating income 
furthermore  the choctaw indian tribe negotiated a compact with the state of mississippi and has opened a land based casino located within approximately miles to the east of jackson  mississippi which has affected lady luck natchez and  if developed  could affect the vicksburg project 
the company also competes with gaming facilities nationwide 
it is also possible that substantial local and nationwide competition could cause the supply of gaming facilities to exceed the demand for gaming 
additionally  certain of the company s competitors have more gaming industry experience  larger operations or significantly greater financial and other resources than the company 
given these factors it is possible that substantial competition could have a material adverse effect on the company s future results of operations 
the lady luck rhythm blues country casino complex s revenues and operating results in were materially adversely affected by a temporary closure by the arkansas department of transportation of the helena bridge 
these casinos are highly dependent on patronage by residents of arkansas 
a change in general economic conditions  future closure of the helena bridge  or the extent and nature of regulations enabling casino gaming in arkansas could adversely effect these casinos future operating results 
the company s computers may not be year compliant 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  which may result in systems failures and disruptions to operations at january  the company has not yet made an assessment of the systems which will be affected  but is developing a plan to evaluate and remediate the year issue 
this remediation plan will include assessing the company s inventory of year issues  contacting the suppliers of certain of their systems to determine the timing of applicable upgrades  and implementing the year upgrades which are currently available 
the company will continue to evaluate its vulnerability in the case of suppliers failure to remediate their respective year issues 
the company has not yet determined whether the effect of the remediation could have a material effect on future financial results 
the company is highly leveraged see liquidity and capital resources below for additional information
