item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
fiscal years   and compared general in fiscal  the company had net income of million on net sales of million compared to a net loss of million in fiscal and net income of million in fiscal on net sales of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
of the million loss in fiscal  million was from restructuring charges and million was from special cost of goods sold charges 
short term debt increased million in fiscal due to higher working capital requirements from expanded sales and the paydown of capital leases 
the company dramatically reduced its debt in fiscal from  to  this reduction was accomplished principally by a sale leaseback transaction which was completed in february the company s mobile  alabama facilities were sold for net proceeds of approximately million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company currently has a million four year credit facility that expires in november availability at any given point in time is a function of eligible accounts receivable and inventory levels 
at october   total availability was million 
during fiscal  the company introduced the new qms magicolor r  a color print system which delivers up to page per minute ppm in color and ppm monochrome  and the new qms magicolor r  a color print system which delivers up to ppm in color and ppm in monochrome 
these new products energized our sales and marketing management team for fiscal and increased the company s ability to compete effectively in domestic and international markets 
additionally  the company enhanced and expanded existing product lines  repositioning the qms and qms print systems in the production printing market with new feature sets and aggressive new price points 
in addition  the company announced in october a return to the original equipment manufacturer oem market with a contract to provide private label print systems and accessories 
the oem market provides an additional channel for product sales without conflicting with our existing sales channels 
the company entered fiscal with a renewed focus on its core business of laser print systems  consumables and service 
with a lowered cost structure  adequate borrowing capacity  new product introductions and a new oem market  the company is positioned for renewed profitability and improved stockholder value 
net sales table table of net sales comparisons for key product groups year to year net sales increases decreases in thousands hardware      consumables      service    europe      japan      all other      total      table hardware and international sales comparisons year to year net sales increases decreases in thousands hardware sales us canada direct      us canada reseller      latin america other     oem   total hardware      europe japan sales controller boards      commissions      total europe japan      total sales increased by million  or  during fiscal compared to a decline of million  or  during fiscal hardware and accessory sales increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal and decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal a substantial portion of this increase relates to oem sales which have risen to million for the year compared to  during fiscal total us and canada direct hardware sales have decreased for fiscal compared to fiscal while the us and canada reseller and oem sales increased for the same period 
this shift reflects the change implemented in february  to move from a direct sales force to distributors and value added resellers  combining direct and reseller sales channels 
management expects continued increases in the reseller and oem distribution channels and a corresponding decrease in the direct channel over the next several quarters 
the decline in fiscal compared to fiscal is principally due to reduced european and japanese sales totaling million 
the decline in european and japanese commissions is chiefly due to fiscal end of life sales of ppm products 
this resulted in higher fiscal sales without a corresponding increase in of the replacement product 
an additional reduction of million occurred in the reseller channel 
reseller sales declined due to a temporary company focus on the graphic arts market and away from traditional reseller markets 
consumables sales decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease relates predominantly to management s decision in the second quarter of fiscal to discontinue bulk sales of ppm monochrome consumables due to eroding margins and the risk of maintaining large inventories of consumables for aging products 
management expects sales of qms labeled hardware and consumables for existing products and oem sales to increase with the sale of additional units 
the us service channel supports the sale of qms products through a nationwide field service organization 
service contracts are available for all company product offerings but are generally written for the higher end products sold through the us direct sales channel 
in addition to qms products  the service organization services products sold by other manufacturers 
service sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal and in fiscal compared to fiscal the decreasing cost of new printers and the tendency to replace rather than repair or maintain printers has affected the service sector of the business  however  increases in the sale of spare parts to oems and others have offset this reduced growth in sales 
europe and japan sales include both controller board sales at cost and commissions earned on product sales 
controller board sales and commissions for europe and japan increased and  respectively  for fiscal after decreasing and  respectively  for fiscal in september  the company reestablished its wholly owned subsidiary in japan 
sales that occurred through a master distributor in japan will now be made through the company s japanese subsidiary 
the company will no longer have product sales to the japanese distributor or receive a commission on sales from the distributor 
this change will increase company sales and gross margin while increasing general and administrative expenses 
this change enables the company to pursue and expand oem agreements with other japanese companies 
the increase in europe revenue for fiscal is primarily from sales of the magicolor product 
european demand for magicolor product is expected to remain strong through the next two quarters 
japan revenue includes product and commission revenue for japan  korea and other pacific rim countries 
during fiscal   and  this revenue was generated through an independent company  qms japan kk  which  until september  had exclusive rights to distribute qms products throughout these countries 
in fiscal  sales to qms japan kk decreased million  or  compared to fiscal principally due to the depressed asian economy 
in fiscal  sales decreased million  or  compared to fiscal this decrease in revenue was caused mainly by the fiscal end of life sales of the ppm product 
gross profit and special charges gross profit dollars increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of sales increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the principal reasons for this increase include the introduction of magicolor in the first quarter of fiscal  favorable manufacturing volume variances  favorable purchase price variances caused by lower yen values  lower excess and obsolete inventory reserve requirements  and special charges incurred in fiscal as described below 
gross profit dollars decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal a decrease of due chiefly to a reduction in revenue  reduced margins on end of life products and special charges totaling million 
excluding special charges  the gross margin on sales decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease is caused by higher expenses to develop new products being amortized over shorter product life spans and increased competition causing lower margins on print system products 
special cost of goods sold charges for fiscal included fourth quarter excess and obsolete and valuation charges of million related to reduced values for surplus inventory and repaired parts 
additionally  a million fourth quarter charge was taken to reduce the balance of capitalized software development costs to estimated net realizable value 
operating expenses operating expenses for fiscal decreased million compared to fiscal operating expenses for fiscal included million in restructuring expenses 
excluding these restructuring charges  operating expenses for fiscal decreased million  or  compared to fiscal this decrease reflects the cost reduction efforts begun in the fourth quarter of fiscal specifically  most of the benefit of the reductions in work force that occurred primarily in august of were recognized in fiscal the combined reduction in salaries from reductions in work force and divestiture of businesses totals million per year 
the company s strategy for fiscal and was to reduce overall costs and bring them in line with revenues 
this was attempted through several avenues including divestitures  reductions in work force  restructuring employee benefit programs  executive salary reductions  and aggressive cost management  although the benefits in fiscal are masked by restructuring charges and increased rental costs 
total operating expenses for fiscal increased to million compared to million for fiscal excluding restructuring expenses  operating expenses were million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the million increase in operating expenses is primarily due to a  increase in rent expense caused by the february sale leaseback of the company s headquarters in mobile  alabama 
restructuring charges there were no restructuring charges for fiscal and restructuring charges in fiscal totaled million from reductions in force and divestiture of businesses 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company ceased operations of its subsidiary qms circuits  inc qci and divested the imaging services business unit ims 
a charge of  was incurred to cover the severance  asset and inventory writedowns  and other closing expenses associated with qci 
in fiscal  ims lost  on sales of  in divesting ims  the company incurred charges of  during fiscal  the company work force decreased nearly to approximately employees due primarily to the closing and divestiture of businesses and a corporate wide reduction in work force 
severance and outplacement expense recorded in fiscal totaled million 
the company entered into agreements during fiscal specifying the retirement of two executives  the president and chief executive officer  and the executive vice president and chief technical officer 
these agreements caused an additional million in fiscal charges related to accelerated retirement benefits and other management transition expenses 
moreover  the company recognized in the income statement cumulative foreign currency translation losses of million in connection with its canadian operations 
these translation losses had previously been recognized as a reduction of stockholders equity 
other income expense interest expense decreased million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal after decreasing million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the reduction in interest expense is directly related to the overall reduction in short term and long term debt due to the divestiture of businesses and sale leaseback of the mobile headquarters and manufacturing property 
the company did not enter into any material foreign exchange contracts during fiscal   or and has no foreign exchange contracts at october  income taxes for fiscal  an income tax provision of  was recognized reflecting estimated alternative minimum taxes on current period income after application of available carryovers of net operating losses and general business credits 
no benefit or provision for income taxes was recognized for fiscal for fiscal  a benefit of of pretax income was recognized 
this benefit resulted from the carryback of losses in japan relating to the divestiture of business operations in that country 
at october   the company had domestic operating loss carryovers and general business credit carryovers of approximately million and million  respectively  which expire in periods ranging from to see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
factors which may affect future results the company s products include components primarily microprocessors and dynamic random access memory devices which  from time to time  are sensitive to market conditions that may result in limited availability and or price fluctuations 
an interruption in the supply of or significant changes in price for these components could have an adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company purchases print engine mechanisms and consumables from japanese suppliers 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will affect the prices of these products 
the company may attempt to mitigate possible negative impacts through yen sharing arrangements with suppliers  foreign exchange contracts  and price negotiations  however  material price increases resulting from exchange rate fluctuations could develop which would adversely affect operating results 
because the company competes in an industry of rapid technological advancement  it is important that the company be able to develop innovative new technologies and leading edge print systems in a timely  cost effective manner 
the company has invested significantly in crown advanced document processing technology which  in addition to providing significantly improved functionality  is intended to reduce the time it takes to develop products 
new product introduction delays could  however  have an adverse impact on operating results 
these factors  including increasingly competitive pressures in the company s markets  along with others that may affect operating results  mean that past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance 
investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
in addition  the company participates in a highly dynamic industry  which can result in significant volatility of the company s common stock price 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million at october   compared to million and million at the end of fiscal and  respectively 
cash flow from operations was million for fiscal compared to million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the company s financing for fiscal   and came principally from cash flows from operations and borrowings under revolving credit agreements 
in addition  the divestiture of businesses and disposal of property  plant and equipment has provided cash flows of million  million and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
the company s working capital was million at october   up from million at the end of fiscal this increase is mostly due to the increased accounts receivable 
at october   the company had borrowings of million under the revolving credit facility with foothill capital corporation foothill and cash on hand totaled million 
total borrowing capacity under this credit facility is million although availability at any given point in time is a function of eligible accounts receivable and inventory levels 
at october   total availability was million 
at october   the company was not in compliance with the maximum total liabilities to equity ratio requirements 
on november   the company s non compliance was remedied by a permanent revision of this requirement from foothill 
the company s current and long term lease liability decreased from million at october   to million at october   due to the expiration of capital leases and management s decision to fund new capital acquisitions from operational cash flow 
at october   the company was not in compliance with certain covenants contained in the operating lease agreement for the sale and leaseback of land and buildings at its corporate headquarters 
on december   the company obtained a one year waiver of non compliance from the lessor through october   in exchange for million in prepaid rent and an amendment to a related warrant agreement to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at per share

on november   the company obtained another waiver of non compliance from the lessor through december  at the end of the waiver period  the company may be out of compliance with one or more covenants contained in the lease agreement 
among the remedies available to the landlord is the acceleration of all rent for the initial lease term  cancellation of the lease  or all other remedies available at law 
management believes over the next year through further negotiations a further extension of the waiver or a permanent revision of the covenant will be obtained 
management believes that the company s fiscal working capital and capital expenditure needs  as well as funding for research and development  will be met by cash flow from operations and by the foothill credit facility

the plan addresses the major areas listed below 
it systems and applications the company has identified internal systems and applications components  of these  were identified as critical 
the company is documenting the cost and time schedule of upgrading non compliant components  or the impact of not upgrading these components 
the company has contacted all critical it systems and applications vendors and has received letters of compliance from them 
as required  these systems have been upgraded

the company is not aware of any anticipated year non compliance issues by its vendors or customers that could materially affect its business operations  however  the company does not control the systems of other companies and cannot assure that such systems will be converted in a timely fashion and  if not converted  would not have an adverse effect on the company s business operations 
the company is dependent upon a variety of local suppliers and vendors for such items as electrical power  telephone service  water  banking services and other necessary commodities 
the company is not currently aware of any non compliance by these vendors that will materially affect its business operations  however  the company does not control these systems and cannot assure that they will be converted in a timely fashion and  if not converted  would not have an adverse effect on the company s business operations 
qms products the design of the company s products precludes the possibility of year errors 
date and time information is passed to the qms printer by the host computer in real time

risks and reasonably likely worst case scenarios although the company has not identified any specific areas of risk  general market year problems outside of the company s control could have an adverse effect on the company s operating results 
contingency and business continuation plan the company will evaluate the need for a formal year contingency plan by june inflation inflationary factors have not had a significant effect on the company s operations in the past three years 
a significant increase in inflation would adversely affect the company s operations 
recently issued accounting standards management does not believe the adoption of any of the recently issued accounting standards described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements will have a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and to a lesser extent interest rates 
the following describes the nature of the risks and demonstrates that  in general  such market risk is not material to the company 
foreign currency exchange risk the company has sales in over countries worldwide 
in fiscal  sales outside the united states accounted for approximately percent of worldwide sales 
virtually all of these sales were denominated in currencies of the local country 
as such  the company s reported profits and cash flows are exposed to changing exchange rates 
to date  management has not deemed it cost effective to engage in a formula based program of hedging the profits and cash flows of foreign operations using derivative financial instruments 
because the company s foreign subsidiaries purchase significant quantities of inventory payable in us dollars  managing the level of inventory and related payables and the rate of inventory turnover provides a level of protection against adverse changes in exchange rates 
in addition  at any point in time  the company s foreign subsidiaries hold financial assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
these financial assets and liabilities consist primarily of short term  third party receivables and payables 
changes in exchange rates affect these financial assets and liabilities 
for the most part  however  these gains or losses arise from translation and  as such  do not significantly affect net income 
on occasion  the company has used derivatives to hedge specific risk situations involving foreign currency exposures  however  these derivative transactions have not been material and no such derivatives were held at october  interest rate risk the financial liabilities of the company that are exposed to changes in interest rates are limited to short term borrowings 
the stated rate of interest for borrowings under the revolving credit agreement is one and one half percent over prime 
management believes interest rate risk for the company is immaterial due to the low short term debt balance
