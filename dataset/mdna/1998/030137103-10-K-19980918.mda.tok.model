sales of thin film products increased by to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year the growth in sales for the registrant s core commercial products occurred entirely in the first half of the fiscal year 
in the second half of the fiscal year  the sales growth for these products substantially declined 
thin film products experienced relatively consistent growth throughout the year 
beginning in the second half of fiscal year  the registrant has experienced a slowdown in orders from foreign customers for its core commercial products 
the registrant believes that this slowdown is primarily the result of the deferral or reduction of several customers manufacturing programs in response to the economic turmoil in several foreign countries particularly in asia and increased competition in foreign markets particularly in europe 
while the registrant cannot predict when the current slowdown in orders will end  the registrant believes that the markets in which its products are sold  such as wireless communications  medical equipment and semiconductors  continue to have significant long term growth potential 
in addition  the registrant is currently reviewing its foreign distribution network in an effort to improve the manner in which it serves its foreign customers 
gross margins were of net sales in fiscal year compared with in fiscal year the increase in gross margins was attributable to the fact that the general manufacturing process problems that negatively affected margins for a large part of the fiscal year were not fully resolved until the second quarter of fiscal year  and the favorable effect of greater production and sales volumes in the first half of the fiscal year combined with a generally fixed cost manufacturing base 
the increase was somewhat offset by continued erosion in prices for the registrant s core products and higher fixed costs in the second half of fiscal year relative to sales volume 
operating expenses totaled million  or of net sales  in fiscal year compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal year the increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to increases in i sales staff  ii advertising and promotional expenses  iii sales representatives commissions incurred on higher levels of sales  principally in the first six months of the fiscal year  iv bonus expense based upon the increase in profits earned in the first six months of the fiscal year  v professional fees  and vi research and development expenses resulting from increased staff and the related supporting expenditures 
net interest income was  in fiscal year compared to net interest expense of  in fiscal year the decrease in net interest expense was attributable to higher interest income as a result of increased cash available for investment  increased income from marketable securities and lower interest expense as a result of lower average outstanding loan balances

demand for these products across a wide range of product lines was especially strong in the latter part of fiscal year hi rel applications include various military programs  which vary from year to year and which the registrant does not anticipate will represent a significant area of growth in the future 
other areas in which the registrant believes significant growth may be anticipated include thin film products which serve many end use applications and products for the wireless pcs infrastructure 
gross margins were of net sales in fiscal year compared with in fiscal year the increase in gross margins was attributable to both a shift in product mix to more specialized  critically sensitive hi rel products  a resolution of some of the general manufacturing process problems that negatively affected the registrant for a large part of the prior fiscal year and the general effect of greater production and sales volumes on a generally fixed cost manufacturing base 
operating expenses totaled million  or of net sales  in fiscal year compared with million  also of net sales  in fiscal year the increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to higher bonus expenses for executives  management personnel and employees as a result of a higher pretax profit  higher advertising and promotion costs to promote both older and newer product lines  and the salary and stock compensation associated with the appointment of a new executive officer 
these expense increases were partially offset by a reduction in research and development expenses due primarily to a reassignment of certain engineering personnel and related salary expense from research and development to manufacturing overhead 
net interest expense was  in fiscal year compared to net interest expense of  in fiscal year the decrease in net interest expense was attributable to higher interest income as a result of increased cash available for investment  increased income from marketable securities and lower interest expense as a result of lower average outstanding loan balances  partially offset by higher interest expense as a result of additions to obligations under capital lease 
the registrant recorded other expense of  in fiscal year as compared to other income of  in fiscal year other income in the prior fiscal year consisted of realized gains on the sale of investments 
the effective income tax rate for fiscal year was approximately as compared to an effective rate of approximately for fiscal year the slightly lower effective income tax rate in fiscal year was the result of a decrease in the state tax rate and an increase in tax benefits available through the registrant s foreign sales corporation subsidiary

inventories increased by million to  at june  as compared to  at june  this increase was attributable to a planned increase in stocks of finished goods designed to enable the registrant to fill customer orders more rapidly and increased inventories of raw materials  particularly palladium  as a hedge against unavailability and unstable pricing for this primary raw material for the registrant s products
