item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview uti is a leading provider of onshore contract drilling services to exploration and production companies and operates one of the largest land drilling rig fleets in the united states 
the company s drilling operations are currently concentrated in the prolific oil and natural gas producing basins of oklahoma  texas and the gulf coast 
the company s rig fleet consists of land drilling rigs that are well suited to the requirements of its markets 
the company s contract drilling services are performed through various regional drilling units and are marketed under the names triad  fwa  southland  cougar  jsm and ipsco 
the company also provides drilling and pressure pumping services in the appalachian basin 
beginning in  the company made a strategic decision to focus its efforts on the expansion of its land drilling operations to take advantage of improving market conditions and the benefits arising from a consolidation in the land drilling industry 
to effect this strategy  the company disposed of its oilfield distribution business in september and immediately embarked on a directed acquisition program aimed at expanding the company s presence in the oil and gas producing regions in the united states 
since november  the company has acquired rigs in five transactions 
i fwa was acquired in november for million net cash  ii viersen was acquired in august for approximately million cash  a two year million note and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at per share  iii the contract drilling assets of quarles in january for million cash and shares of common stock having a value at the time of million  iv the contract drilling business of southland was acquired in april  for million in cash and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at per share  and v jsm was acquired on september   for  shares of common stock and approximately million in cash 
these acquisitions have resulted in the company realizing substantial growth in its revenues and earnings 
the company s results for the year ended december   also reflect an improvement in market conditions in the united states land drilling markets resulting from an increase in demand for drilling services 
during  the company was able to increase the rates charged to its customers 
fleet utilization increased to from in the company has continued to focus on streamlining operations and reducing its cost structure  which has further increased operating margins and profitability 
the level of drilling activity in the onshore oil and gas exploration and production industry in the united states has been volatile and no assurance can be given that recent levels of oil and gas exploration activities in the company s markets will continue or that demand for the company s services will correspond to the level of activity in the industry generally 
further  any changes in the demand for or supply of oil and natural gas materially impacts the demand for and pricing of the company s services 
in this regard  in and most of  the company and the united states contract drilling industry in general experienced improvement in demand and pricing for their services  as relatively stable and improved oil or natural gas prices combined with a strong world economy to increase exploration and development activity worldwide 
in recent months  however  the worldwide price of oil has declined over to under per barrel for spot deliveries and prices for natural gas have weakened slightly on a year to year basis 
these declines have been attributed to  among other things  an excess supply of oil in the world markets  reduced domestic demand associated with an unseasonably warm winter and the potential for lower worldwide demand due to the impact of the economic downturn in southeast asia 
as prices for oil have continued to decline  some exploration and production companies  including some of the company s customers  have announced reductions in previously disclosed spending budgets 
such reductions can be expected to reduce the demand for drilling services and increase competitive pressures  which could lead to lower contract rates 
each of the company s operating regions could be affected by the above mentioned factors 
the permian basin region is more sensitive to changes in oil prices than any other of the company s operating regions and has already begun to see reduced utilization rates for its rigs in that region 
the company intends to continue its strategy of growth through acquisitions of rigs and equipment that can be easily integrated into its fleet and operations and through acquisitions of other drilling contractors that may provide opportunities for expansion of the company s markets and services 
results of operations the company views the number of rigs actively drilling in the united states as a barometer of the overall strength of the domestic oilfield service industry 
without giving effect to acquisitions  variations in revenues and gross margins of the company s core business generally follow the rig count trend 
subsequent to year end  the united states land rig count has declined from active rigs at december  to active rigs at march  the following table presents certain results of operations data for the company and the average united states rig count as reported by baker hughes inc for the periods indicated years ended december  operating data average us land rig count us number of owned rigs at end of period

its active rig count is generally regarded as an industry standard for measuring industry activity levels 
an operating day is defined as a day during which a rig is being operated  mobilized  assembled or dismantled while under contract 
utilization rates are based on a day year and are calculated by dividing the number of rigs utilized by the total number of rigs in the company s drilling fleet  including stacked rigs

as a result  the year ie  could be the maximum date value systems will be able to accurately process 
management does not anticipate that the company will incur material operating expenses or be required to invest heavily in computer system improvements to be year compliant
