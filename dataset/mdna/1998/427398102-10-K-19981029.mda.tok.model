year readiness the year problem relates to computer systems that have time and date sensitive programs that were designed to read years beginning with  but may not properly recognize the year if a computer system or software application used by the company or a third party dealing with the company fails because of the inability of the system or application to properly read the year the results could have a material adverse effect on the company 
a substantial part of the company s revenues are derived from firm fixed price contracts with us government agencies  prime contractors or subcontractors on military or aerospace programs  and many foreign governments 
if the company is unable to perform under these contracts due to a year problem  the customer could terminate the contract for default 
while lost revenue s from such an event are a concern for the company  the greater risks are the consequential damages for which the company could be liable for failure to perform under the contracts 
such damages could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations and financial position 
the most likely reason for a customer to terminate a contract for default would be due to the company s inability to manufacture and deliver product under the contract 
breakdowns in any number of the company s computer systems and applications could prevent the company from being able to manufacture and ship its products 
examples are failures in the company s manufacturing application software  computer chips embedded in engineering test equipment  lack of supply of materials from its suppliers  or lack of power  heat  or water from utilities servicing its facilities 
the company s products do not contain computer devices that require remediation to meet year requirements 
a review of the company s status with respect to remediating its computer systems for year compliance is presented below 
for its information technology  the company currently utilizes a hewlett packard hp based computing environment 
the hp hardware is in compliance with year requirements 
the company s financial  manufacturing  and other software applications related to the hp have been updated to comply with year requirements at a cost of approximately  certain modules have been fully tested  with the remaining modules to be tested by the end of fiscal in addition  the company utilizes a wide area network wan to connect its operating facilities to the hp the wan has been updated to comply with year requirements 
a local area network lan is used to supplement the hp environment and has also been upgraded and is fully year compliant 
the company is also reviewing its utility systems heat  light  phones  liquid nitrogen  etc 
for the impact of year  as well as determining the state of readiness of its material suppliers 
the company will develop a questionnaire to be sent to its significant suppliers  and to its test equipment manufacturers concerning embedded technology  regarding their compliance and attempt to identify any problem areas with respect to them 
this process will be ongoing and the company s efforts with respect to specific problems identified  and future costs associated with them  will depend in part upon its assessment of the risk that any such problems may cause a disruption in manufacturing or other problem which the company believes would have a material adverse impact on its operations 
however  the company cannot control the conduct of its suppliers 
therefore  there can be no guarantee that year problems originating with a supplier will not occur 
the company has not yet developed contingency plans in the event of a year failure caused by a supplier or third party  but would intend to do so if a specific problem is identified through the process described above 
the company has developed multiple sources for a substantial portion of its raw material requirements and  therefore  does not believe there would be a significant disruption in supply 
the information set forth above identifies the key steps taken by the company to address the year problem 
there can be no absolute assurance that third parties will convert their systems in a timely manner 
the company believes that its actions will minimize these risks and that any additional cost of year compliance for its information and production systems will not be material to its consolidated results of operations and financial position
