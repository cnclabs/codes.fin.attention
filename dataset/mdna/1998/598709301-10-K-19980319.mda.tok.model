item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the company operates in three business segments plastics technologies formerly plastics machinery  machine tools and industrial products 
in the last four years  the company has achieved record sales in each succeeding year 
the sales increases in through resulted principally from the growth of the plastics technologies and industrial products segments  largely as a result of acquisitions 
the sales increase resulted principally from internal growth in the plastics technologies and machine tool segments 
the sales level in the industrial products segment benefited from two small acquisitions  but its sales were held back by the translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
acquisitions and divestitures in  the company acquired two businesses data flute cnc in june and minnesota twist drill in september 
both businesses are included in the industrial products segment 
these acquisitions resulted in an increase in new orders and sales of approximately million 
on january   the company acquired d m e  which is included in the company s plastics technologies segment for eleven months of this acquisition had the effect of increasing new orders and sales by approximately million in  and million in when compared with in  the company acquired two businesses widia in february and talbot in july 
both businesses are included in the industrial products segment 
the timing of these acquisitions caused an increase in new orders and sales in of approximately million when compared with on december   the company sold its electronic systems division esd  which was included in the machine tools segment 
while most of its sales were made to other milacron businesses  esd also contributed approximately million and million of new orders and sales  respectively  to external customers in esd s operating earnings were million in  and its disposition resulted in a gain of million before tax million after tax 
on january   the company sold its american mine tool amt business which was formerly part of the industrial products segment 
amt s new orders  sales and operating earnings were immaterial  but its disposition resulted in a gain of million before tax million after tax in presence outside the us in recent years  the company s growth outside the us has allowed the company to become less dependent on the us industrial sector 
in  markets outside the us represented the following percentages of consolidated sales europe  asia  canada and mexico  and the rest of the world 
as a result of the company s geographic sales mix  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the translation of sales and earnings  as well as consolidated shareholders equity 
the most important factors are the exchange rates of the british pound and the german mark 
throughout part of  the financial statement effects of a weaker german mark and related european currencies were to some degree offset by the effects of a stronger british pound 
in  however  the pound somewhat stabilized while the mark has continued to weaken 
as a result  the company has experienced more significant translation effects in  resulting in negative currency effects on new orders and sales of million and million  respectively 
the translation effect on net earnings approximated million  or 
per share 
in  there was also a million decrease in shareholders equity due to cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments 
if the mark remains at current levels or weakens further in  the company will continue to experience a negative effect on translating its european new orders  sales and net earnings when compared with about of the company s sales were to customers located in korea and the asean countries the areas most severely impacted by southeast asia market and currency difficulties toward the end of the net effect of these asian difficulties was to reduce the company s net earnings by approximately million in the fourth quarter of while it is impossible to forecast the ultimate worldwide impact of these difficulties  the company currently believes that the current magnitude of these issues is not likely to warrant major revisions to the company s expectations 
the company further believes that asian markets hold excellent potential for both sales and earnings growth over the long term 
earnings per common share beginning with the fourth quarter of  earnings per common share eps are being calculated in accordance with newly issued rules established by the financial accounting standards board 
the new rules require the company to report two eps amounts basic and diluted 
for the company  the calculation for diluted eps closely approximates the company s previously disclosed eps figures under the old accounting rules 
the company has restated prior year eps figures under the new accounting rules whenever appropriate and eps figures cited in this management s discussion and analysis refer to diluted eps amounts 
compared to new orders and backlog new orders in were  million  which represented a million  or  increase from the  million in orders for plastics technologies products increased by million  or  principally due to increased orders for us built injection molding machines 
machine tool orders increased by million  or  due to increased orders for us built horizontal machining centers and aerospace related systems 
orders for industrial products increased by million  or  of which million resulted from the acquisitions 
excluding the effect of acquisitions and foreign currency translation effects  new orders increased for this segment by as all major us product lines showed improvement 
us export orders were million in compared to million in the company s backlog of unfilled orders totaled million at december  this compares to million at december  these high levels are being maintained in large part by increased orders for us built machine tools for aerospace customers 
sales sales in were  million  which represented a million  or  increase over this increase was caused principally by internal growth in the plastics technologies and machine tools segments 
sales were affected by a million negative effect of currency translation adjustments 
excluding the acquisitions and currency translation effects  sales increased by 
sales of plastics technologies increased by million  or  primarily due to increased sales of us built injection molding machines 
machine tool sales increased by million  or  due to increased us sales  and despite reduced sales of uk built machines 
industrial products sales increased by million  or 
however  after excluding the acquisitions and currency translation effects  sales increased by million  or 
sales of all segments to non us markets totaled million  a decrease in of million  and export sales totaled million  an increase of million 
in and  products manufactured outside the us approximated and of sales  respectively  while products sold outside the us approximated and of sales  respectively 
margins  costs and expenses amortization of goodwill had  until  been included in cost of products sold 
because of its increased significance as a result of acquisitions  the company has concluded that it more properly belongs in the caption  other costs and expenses net in the consolidated statement of earnings 
amounts for cost of products sold  manufacturing margins and related percentages  and other costs and expenses net for prior years have been restated for consistency of presentation 
amortization expense has been as follows million  million and million in  and  respectively 
manufacturing margins as a percent to sales  were in and in margins for machine tools and industrial products improved in  while margins for plastics technologies were depressed through the first three quarters of due to pricing pressures on us built injection molding machines 
plastics technologies margins improved slightly in the fourth quarter of total selling and administrative expense increased in amount  as expected  due to increases in certain selling costs that vary with sales levels 
administrative expenses increased modestly 
as a percent to sales  selling expense declined to approximately of sales and administrative expenses remained at approximately of sales 
the expense for minority shareholders interests in earnings of subsidiaries relates principally to widia s subsidiary in india 
the increased expense is caused by the subsidiary s improved profitability 
other expense net  including amortization of goodwill  increased to million in from million in the increase was caused primarily by the absence of favorable settlements of legal claims that are included in the amount and the inclusion of severance expense of approximately million in the first quarter of relating to approximately employees at ferromatik  the company s german injection molding machine subsidiary 
as a result of this and other actions at ferromatik  the company expects to achieve annualized savings of million  which began to phase in during the second quarter of interest expense net of interest income  was million in compared with million in the decrease was due to lower average debt levels and lower borrowing rates as well as the effects of foreign currency translation 
income taxes the provision for income taxes in  and includes us federal and state and local income taxes  and income taxes in other jurisdictions outside the us the company entered all three years with sizeable net operating loss nol carryforwards  along with valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions against the nol carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
by december   the company had fully utilized its us nol carryforwards  but as of december   its non us nol carryforwards totaled million  most of which have no expiration dates 
the company s practice is to periodically reevaluate the future realization of all of its deferred tax assets 
during the period  the company concluded that it is more likely than not that a portion of these assets will be offset against future taxable income 
as a result  the company reversed valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions which caused the provision for income taxes to be less than the statutory rate 
the company expects the utilization of these nol carryforwards and reversal of additional valuation allowances to continue to cause the effective tax rate to be less than the us statutory rate through at least  although the overall rate is expected to increase to approximately in earnings net earnings in were million  or per share  compared with million  or per share in net earnings increased  while per share earnings increased  which also includes the effect of increased common shares outstanding throughout compared to new orders and backlog new orders for were  million  which represented a million  or  increase over excluding the effects of acquisitions and divestitures  new orders decreased by million  which approximates the decline caused by changes in currency exchange rates 
orders for plastics technologies increased million 
excluding the effects of the d m e acquisition  however  new orders for plastics technologies declined by million  or  due primarily to weaker order levels for injection molding machines in the us in the first half of machine tool orders totaled million  virtually unchanged from level 
however  after excluding the effect of the esd divestiture  new orders for machine tools increased million  or  largely due to increased orders for uk built standard machine tools and us built aerospace products 
this segment experienced reduced orders for us built standard machine tools throughout much of the year  but orders improved in the fourth quarter 
orders for industrial products were million 
after excluding the effect of the talbot and widia acquisitions  new orders for industrial products declined million  or  due primarily to the weakening german mark throughout the year  and a weakening of the market for european cutting tools and industrial magnets in the last half of us export orders increased to million in  up over from due primarily to the d m e acquisition and the receipt of a single million export order 
at december   the backlog of unfilled orders was million  up from million at december  the increase relates primarily to increased orders for us built machine tools  including aerospace products 
sales sales in were  million  which represented an million  or  increase over the increase was caused primarily by the d m e acquisition 
excluding the effect of acquisitions and divestitures  sales decreased by approximately million  of which million was due to the effect of currency translation adjustments 
sales of plastics technologies increased by million 
excluding the effects of the d m e acquisition  however  sales of plastics technologies declined by million  or  due primarily to weaker orders for us built injection molding machines in the first half of and european built injection molding machines throughout the year 
machine tool sales declined million 
after excluding the esd divestiture effect  however  sales for machine tools declined million  or  due to reduced sales of us built standard machine tools  in part offset by increased sales of uk built standard machine tools and us built aerospace products 
industrial products sales increased  although after excluding the acquisitions  sales declined million  or  due to currency translation effects and a weaker european market 
sales of all segments to non us markets totaled million  an increase in of million  and export sales totaled million  an increase of million 
the increases resulted primarily from the d m e acquisition 
in both and  products manufactured outside the us approximated of sales while products sold outside the us approximated of sales 
margins  costs and expenses manufacturing margins  as a percent to sales  were in compared with in  excluding esd s margins from  the ongoing business margins increased from in to in plastics technologies margins increased in the us despite continued price pressures  but declined in germany due to temporary excess staffing levels at ferromatik 
machine tool margins also increased  after excluding esd s margins from results 
industrial products margins improved for the year but declined in the fourth quarter due to reduced sales volume in widia s european businesses 
selling and administrative expense increased in due to the d m e acquisition and increased sales 
as a percent to sales  however  selling expense continued to approximate of sales and administrative expense continued to approximate of sales 
other net  including amortization of goodwill  declined in to million from million in due to reduced costs associated with the sale of accounts receivable  increased gains on sales of fixed assets  favorable settlement of legal claims and other similar items which may not recur in the future 
interest expense  net of interest income  was million in compared to million in the expense increase was primarily attributable to the temporary use of debt to fund the d m e acquisition 
this debt was later repaid from the proceeds of the equity offering described below and  accordingly  interest expense declined during the second half of the year 
earnings net earnings in were million  or per share  compared with million  or per share in the net earnings included million  or per share  resulting from the combined effects of the gain on the disposition of two businesses  offset by an integration charge for valenite 
excluding those items  net earnings increased by million  or  while per share earnings increased by  or  which also includes the effect of an increase in outstanding common shares 
year the company is implementing plans to address potential exposures to various systems caused by the approach of the year many of the company s systems are already year compliant  while other systems are being reprogrammed  and  in some cases  the company is using this opportunity to implement more modern systems which are already year compliant 
the financial impact of these changes is not expected to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
change in fiscal year in november   the board of directors approved management s plan to change the company s fiscal year from a week year ending on the saturday closest to december st to a calendar year ending on december st each year 
in  the transition year  the company s fiscal year will begin december  and conclude december  the change is not expected to have a material effect on financial condition  results of operations or cash flows for the year however  the company s calendar had weeks each in quarters  and  and weeks in quarter  while the calendar in future years will have three months in each quarter 
this change will cause inconsistency in quarterly reporting throughout due to the inclusion in of an additional days in quarter  days in quarter  fewer days in quarter and an additional days in quarter in comparison to quarterly amounts for will not be restated because it is impracticable to do so 
liquidity and sources of capital at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million  a decrease of million during the year 
operating activities provided million of cash in  compared with million provided in operating activities cash flows have been reduced by cash costs of million and million in and  respectively  for ferromatik severance payments in  and the widia valenite integration and restructuring in investing activities in resulted in a million use of cash  primarily due to capital expenditures of million and the cost of acquisitions 
investing activities in resulted in a million use of cash  mostly due to the d m e acquisition  as well as million of capital expenditures 
net cash used by investing activities in included million for the widia acquisition and million for the talbot acquisition 
also affecting was million provided from the divestitures of esd and amt 
financing activities used million of cash in  which includes the effect of a dividend increase and the purchase of treasury shares 
financing activities provided million of cash in  primarily due to million of net proceeds from the issuance of million additional shares of common stock 
in  financing activities provided million of cash  primarily due to the issuance of million of notes 
as of december   the company s current ratio of was unchanged from december  at december   the company had lines of credit with various us and us banks of approximately million  including a million committed revolving credit facility which expires in january under the provisions of the facility  the company s additional borrowing capacity totaled approximately million at december  subsequent to the end of  the facility was increased to million 
the amended facility continues to impose restrictions on total indebtedness in relation to earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the company anticipates that it will be able to continue to comply with these restrictions throughout the term of the facility 
the company had a number of short term intercompany loans and advances denominated in various currencies totaling million at december   that were subject to foreign currency exchange risk 
the company also enters into various transactions  in the ordinary course of business  for the purchase and sale of goods and services in various currencies 
the company hedges its exposure to currency fluctuations related to short term intercompany loans and advances and the purchase and sale of goods under firm commitments by entering into foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the company is currently not involved with any additional derivative financial instruments 
the interest rates on the lines of credit and the financing fees on the receivables purchase agreement fluctuate based on changes in prevailing interest rates in the countries in which amounts are borrowed or receivables are sold 
at december   approximately million was subject to the effects of fluctuations in interest rates under these arrangements 
future changes in interest rates will affect the company s interest expense and other financing costs 
total debt was million at december   a decrease of million over december  total shareholders equity was million at december   an increase of million over december   despite the adverse effect of a million change in the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment caused by the effects of a stronger us dollar 
as a result  the ratio of total debt to total capital debt plus equity improved to at december  from at december  during  the company purchased  shares of the company s stock on the open market to satisfy the needs of management incentive  employee benefit and dividend reinvestment plans 
subsequent to year end  the company purchased an additional  shares for these plans requirements 
additional purchases may be made later in the year 
in addition  capital expenditures are expected to approximate million 
and  in the first half of  the company expects to begin implementing a cost cutting program to reduce staffing at widia in germany and in certain other european locations 
this program is currently estimated to result in a million net cash cost in the company believes that its cash flow from operations and available credit lines will be sufficient to meet these and other operating requirements 
outlook the company s strategy primarily focuses on internal growth  which is somewhat dependent upon the worldwide economic climate  and productivity gains 
in  the company anticipates weakness in certain asian markets but modestly improving economic conditions in europe 
in north america  the company recognizes that automotive production may weaken but expects most of the other key sectors of its business to remain at healthy levels 
based on this economic climate  among other things  the company s goals are for about a sales increase coupled with a increase in earnings per share
