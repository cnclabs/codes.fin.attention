item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company is an international biopharmaceutical company that acquires  develops and commercializes specialist oriented proprietary drugs for treating chronic and life threatening diseases  including hepatitis b  hepatitis c  cancer  immune system disorders and cystic fibrosis 
currently  the company has two drugs in clinical development  zadaxin for hepatitis b  hepatitis c  cancer and immune system disorders  and cpx for cystic fibrosis 
the company also has other drug candidates in preclinical development 
to date  the company s principal focus has been the development and commercialization of zadaxin and the development of cpx 
from commencement of operations through december   the company incurred a cumulative net loss of approximately million 
the company expects its operating expenses to increase over the next several years as it expands its research and development  clinical testing and marketing capabilities 
the company s ability to achieve profitable operations is primarily dependent on increasing zadaxin sales in approved markets  securing regulatory approvals for zadaxin in additional countries and successfully launching zadaxin  if approved  in such countries 
in addition  other factors may also impact the company s ability to achieve a profitable level of operations such as spending associated with successful development of cpx  acquiring rights to additional drugs  and entering into and extending agreements for product development and commercialization  where appropriate 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attain these objectives or that the company will ever achieve a profitable level of operations 
the company s operating results may fluctuate from period to period as a result of  among other things  market acceptance of zadaxin  the timing and costs associated with preclinical and clinical development of the company s products  the regulatory approval process  and the acquisition of additional product rights 
the company participates in a highly dynamic industry  which often results in significant volatility of the company s common stock price 
setbacks in the launch  sale or distribution of zadaxin  preclinical and clinical development of the company s products  the regulatory approval process or relationships with collaborative partners  and any shortfalls in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts  among other developments  have in the past had and could in the future have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period 
results of operations product sales were approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
currently  the company has received approval to market zadaxin in argentina  kuwait  the people s republic of china  peru  the philippines and singapore 
for the year ended december   the first full year of zadaxin sales  one customer in china accounted for of the company s product sales 
the company s accounts receivable collections in china are typically days or longer 
such customer represents of the accounts receivable balance at december  such collections to date have been slower than anticipated and the company is currently monitoring the situation 
at the end of  the company has allowances for bad debts of  if collection of outstanding accounts receivable does not improve  it may become necessary to further increase related allowances for bad debts 
in addition  the company has filed for approval to market zadaxin in several countries and anticipates additional filings in other countries 
as a result  the company expects product sales to increase in its existing approved markets in and beyond  upon the commencement of the commercial launch of zadaxin in additional markets once regulatory approvals are secured 
the level of such product sales increase is dependent upon increased zadaxin market penetration in the company s existing approved markets  additional zadaxin marketing approvals and the successful launch of zadaxin in new markets 
although the company remains optimistic regarding the prospects of zadaxin  there can be no assurance that the company will ever achieve significant levels of product sales or that the company will receive additional zadaxin market approvals 
cost of product sales was approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase is attributable to increased product sales 
the company expects cost of product sales to vary from quarter to quarter  dependent upon the level of product sales  the absorption of fixed product related costs  and any charges associated with excess or expiring finished product 
research and development expenses were approximately   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
for the year ended december   the decrease in research and development expenses as compared to was due to decreased professional fees partially offset by increased clinical trial expenses 
clinical trial expenses in were impacted by additional clinical trial expenses for the clinical development of cpx  a synthetic compound licensed in april from the nih as a potential treatment for cystic fibrosis 
in april  the company commenced its cpx clinical trial program in the us in addition  the company is pursuing a corporate partnering arrangement with a major pharmaceutical company for a pivotal phase development of combination zadaxin plus interferon for hepatitis c in the us and europe 
the initiation and continuation of these programs by the company had and will continue to have a significant effect on the company s research and development expenses in the future and will require the company to seek additional capital resources 
for the year ended december   the decrease in research and development expenses as compared to was primarily attributable to decreases in regulatory expenses and in costs associated with decreased zadaxin clinical trials  essentially due to the completion of the zadaxin taiwan phase hepatitis b trial during the first half of  offset by increased preclinical development expenses associated with cpx 
in general  the company expects product research and development expenses to increase over the next several years and to vary quarter to quarter as the company pursues its strategy of initiating additional clinical trials and testing  entering into one or more corporate partnering arrangements  acquiring product rights  and expanding regulatory activities 
marketing expenses were approximately   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the decrease in as compared to is due to decreased professional services and travel expenses partially offset by increased publications and promotional material expenses associated with the launch of zadaxin in its approved markets 
the decrease in as compared to is primarily attributable to decreased payroll costs related to an executive officer who left the company in  offset by increased professional services  primarily consulting services expenses  regarding preparations for the launch of zadaxin in its approved markets in early the company expects marketing expenses to increase significantly in the next several quarters and years as it anticipates expanding its commercialization and marketing efforts and pursuing other strategic relationships 
general and administrative expenses were approximately   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase in as compared to is due to increased general office expenses associated with increased rent and office relocation expenses and investment banking fees and fees for professional services  primarily legal and accounting fees  associated with the company s adoption of a shareholder rights plan and proposed public offering 
the increase in as compared to is primarily attributable to increased payroll costs offset by decreased expenses for professional services  primarily legal services and consulting fees 
in the near term  the company expects general and administrative expenses to vary quarter to quarter as the company augments its general and administrative activities and resources to support increased expenditures on clinical trials and testing  and regulatory  pre commercialization and marketing activities 
net interest and investment income was approximately   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the decrease in as compared to and in as compared to resulted from decreased interest and investment income due to lower average invested cash balances 
liquidity and capital resources in april  the company received  before deducting expenses from the sale of  shares of series c convertible preferred stock from a private placement 
in march  the company also received approximately  from one of its executive officers as a partial payment of an outstanding loan 
see note notes receivable from officers 
in july  the company loaned thomas e 
moore  former chairman and one of the founders of the company  million secured by approximately million shares of sciclone common stock owned by mr 
moore 
the loan carries interest at 
during the period mr 
moore s loan is outstanding and immediately prior to the closing of any offering of the company s common stock  the company may convert the loan  in a non cash exchange into mr 
moore s sciclone common stock by retiring shares of his sciclone common stock at a fixed discount rate from the offering price 
to date  the company has not retired any of mr 
moore s sciclone common stock 
in connection with this transaction  mr 
moore resigned from the company 
on december   the principal balance of the loan was million and was classified as an offset to shareholders equity 
at december   and  the company had approximately  and  respectively  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid short term and long term investments 
net cash used by the company in operating activities amounted to approximately   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  is greater than the company s net loss for such period primarily due to increases in accounts receivable associated with sales from the company s launch of zadaxin in its approved markets and increases in payments to third parties for goods and services and to employees for compensation and benefits 
these amounts were partially offset by non cash charges associated with depreciation and amortization  decreases in prepayments of certain future expenses  and increases in amounts owed to third parties for clinical trials 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  is less than the company s net loss for such period primarily due to non cash charges associated with depreciation of furniture and equipment and amortization of deferred compensation in addition to increases in amounts owed to third parties for goods and services 
these amounts were partially offset by cash used for inventory purchases  increases in and prepayments of certain future period expenses and payments of amounts owed to third parties related to clinical trial expenses and compensation and benefits 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was greater than the company s net loss for such period primarily due to cash used for inventory purchases  the prepayment of certain future period expenses and increases in accounts receivable 
these cash uses were partially offset by increases in amounts owed to third parties for goods and services related to clinical trial expenses in addition to noncash charges associated with depreciation and amortization 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  primarily related to the net sale of approximately  in marketable securities offset by the purchase of approximately  in equipment and furniture 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  primarily related to the net sale of approximately  in marketable securities offset by the purchase of approximately  in equipment and furniture 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  primarily related to the net sale of approximately  in marketable securities offset by the purchase of approximately  in equipment and furniture 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  consisted of approximately  related to company s repurchase of its common stock under the company s approved stock repurchase plan  the amounts loaned to mr 
thomas e 
moore referred to above of  offset by approximately  in proceeds received from the issuance of common stock by the exercise of outstanding warrants and from the issuance of common stock under the company s stock option plan and employee stock purchase plan 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  related to approximately  in proceeds received from the issuance of common stock under the company s stock option plan offset by approximately  related to company s repurchase of its common stock 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  related to the company s repurchase of approximately  of its common stock offset by approximately  in proceeds received from the issuance of common stock under the company s stock option plan 
management believes its existing capital resources and interest on funds available are adequate to maintain its current and planned operations through in december  the company filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission with respect to a proposed registered direct placement of its common stock but decided not to proceed with such offering due to market conditions and other factors 
the company subsequently concluded an offering of convertible preferred stock with proceeds of  before deducting expenses and is actively pursuing additional financings including a private placement of common stock and an equity line 
the company believes it will conclude one or more of such additional financings in the next three to six months although no assurance can be given that such financing will occur in the time frame expected by the company  on terms favorable to the company  or at all 
the company is considering corporate partnering and other opportunities to increase its capital resources and if one or more of such other opportunities occurred  the company would consider accelerating drug development activities  including clinical trials 
the company s capital requirements may change depending upon numerous factors  including the level of zadaxin product sales  the availability of complementary products  technologies and businesses  the initiation of preclinical and clinical trials and testing  the timing of regulatory approvals  developments in relationships with existing or future collaborative partners and the status of competitive products 
the company continues to pursue corporate partnering and public and private financing alternatives 
if the company cannot eventually generate sufficient funds from operations  it will need to raise additional financing in the near future 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms and on a timely basis  if at all 
impact of the year as the year approaches  an issue impacting all companies has emerged regarding how existing application software programs and operating systems can accommodate this date value 
in brief  many existing application software products in the marketplace were designed to accommodate only a two digit date position which represents the year eg  is stored on the system and represents the year 
as a result  the year ie  could be the maximum date value systems will be able to accurately process 
management is in the process of working with its software vendors to assure that the company is prepared for the year management does not anticipate that the company will incur significant operating expenses or be required to invest heavily in computer system improvements to be year compliant 
factors that may affect future operating results dependence on zadaxin and cpx 
the company s principal drug development efforts are currently focused primarily on zadaxin and cpx 
clinical trials of zadaxin sponsored by the company and or other parties are currently in progress or planned and favorable results from such trials will be necessary to gain regulatory approval in significant markets 
sales of zadaxin commenced in but are not material at this time 
while zadaxin has been approved for commercial sale for treatment of hepatitis b in the people s republic of china  kuwait  peru  the philippines and singapore  no assurance can be given that zadaxin approvals will be obtained in additional countries or for the treatment of additional indications  such as hepatitis c or cancer  in a timely fashion or at all 
the company s launch of zadaxin in the people s republic of china  the philippines and singapore is the first commercial introduction of zadaxin by the company  and no assurance can be given that commercialization of zadaxin will prove successful 
the company has not yet launched zadaxin in argentina  kuwait or peru and no assurance can be given that future launch of zadaxin will prove successful 
future sales of zadaxin will depend on market acceptance and successful distribution 
in particular  although the people s republic of china has the highest hepatitis b prevalence rate in the world  the low average income and poorly developed distribution infrastructure present ongoing challenges to successful commercialization of zadaxin in that market 
because the company currently relies on zadaxin as its sole source of revenue  the failure to demonstrate the drug s efficacy in future clinical trials  obtain additional marketing approvals or commercialize the drug successfully would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company may experience delays and encounter difficulties in clinical trials of cpx 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any clinical trial will provide statistically significant evidence of the efficacy of cpx in treating cf 
a failure to demonstrate the efficacy of cpx in a cf clinical trial  obtain regulatory approval of cpx for cf or successfully commercialize cpx would have a material adverse effect on the company 
no history of significant revenues  continuing operating losses 
the company has only recently generated revenues from the commercialization of its products  and there is substantial uncertainty regarding the timing and amount of any future revenues and whether such future revenues will be material 
the company cannot predict when or if marketing approvals for cpx will be obtained or additional marketing approvals for zadaxin will be obtained 
even if such approvals are obtained  there can be no assurance that zadaxin and cpx will be commercialized successfully 
the company has experienced significant operating losses since its inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
the company expects its operating expenses to increase over the next several years as it expands its development  clinical testing and marketing capabilities 
the company s ability to achieve a profitable level of operations is dependent in large part on successful expansion of the market for zadaxin in asia  latin america and the middle east  obtaining additional regulatory approvals for zadaxin and or future products  entering into a corporate partnering arrangement for pivotal phase development of combination zadaxin plus interferon for hepatitis c in the us and europe  entering into other agreements for product development and commercialization  where appropriate  and continuing to expand from development into successful marketing 
there can be no assurance that the company will ever achieve a profitable level of operations 
future capital needs  uncertainty of additional financing 
the company will need additional financing to support its long term product development and commercialization programs 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including progress with preclinical testing and clinical trials  the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  patent costs  competing technological and market developments  the nature of existing and future collaborative relationships  and the company s ability to establish development  sales  manufacturing and marketing arrangements 
no assurance can be given that adequate financing will be available to the company on acceptable terms and on a timely basis  if at all 
dependence on third parties 
the company s strategy contemplates that it will enter into various arrangements with other entities 
to date  the company has acquired rights to zadaxin  cpx and certain other drugs but is only actively pursuing clinical development of zadaxin and cpx 
failure to license or otherwise acquire rights to additional drugs would result in a shortage of products for development 
in addition  the company has licensed exclusive rights to develop and market zadaxin in japan to spkk 
spkk has a substantial commitment to alpha interferon  which is an approved therapy for hepatitis b and hepatitis c in japan 
there can be no assurance that the relationship will prove successful or that the company will be able to negotiate additional arrangements in the future 
the amount and timing of resources that collaborators devote to their activities with the company will not be within the control of the company and may be affected by financial difficulties or other factors affecting these third parties 
there can be no assurance that such parties will perform their obligations as expected 
moreover  the company s ability to obtain regulatory approval in one country may be delayed or adversely affected by the timing of regulatory activities and approvals in one or more other countries  particularly if the company does not participate in the regulatory approval process in such other countries 
see business manufacturing and marketing and sales 
foreign sales and operations 
the company s financial condition in the near term will be highly dependent on zadaxin sales in foreign jurisdictions  where sales and operations are subject to inherent risks  including difficulties and delays in obtaining pricing approvals and reimbursement  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  political instability  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  currency fluctuations and potential adverse tax consequences 
certain foreign countries regulate pricing of pharmaceuticals and such regulation may result in prices significantly below those that would prevail in a free market 
the majority of the company s current sales are to customers in the people s republic of china where the company s accounts receivable collections are typically days or greater 
such collections to date have been slower than anticipated and the company is currently monitoring the situation 
if collection of outstanding accounts receivable does not continue to improve  it may become necessary to further increase the related allowances for bad debts or slow the rate of sales to this market 
patents and proprietary rights 
most european composition of matter patents for thymosin alpha expired in october the company will in the future have only limited composition of matter patents for thymosin alpha or other products and this could adversely affect the company s proprietary rights 
however  the company owns or has exclusive licenses for use and process patents or patent applications in the us and other jurisdictions for thymosin alpha and cpx and will seek to protect such products from competition through such patent protection and through other means 
see business patents and proprietary rights 
the company s success is significantly dependent on its ability to obtain patent protection for its products and technologies and to preserve its trade secrets and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties 
no assurance can be given that the company s pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or that any patents will provide competitive advantages or will not be invalidated or circumvented by its competitors 
moreover  no assurance can be given that patents are not issued to  or patent applications have not been filed by  other companies which would have an adverse effect on the company s ability to use  manufacture or market its products or maintain its competitive position with respect to its products 
numerous patents and patent applications relating to thymosin alpha are held under exclusive license and the breach by the company of the terms of such license could result in the loss of the company s rights to such patents and patent applications 
other companies obtaining patents claiming products or processes useful to the company may bring infringement actions against the company and such litigation is typically costly and time consuming 
as a result  the company may be required to obtain licenses from others or not be able to use  manufacture or market its products 
such licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
the patent positions of biotechnology firms generally are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
no consistent policy has emerged regarding the validity and scope of claims in biotechnology patents  and courts have issued varying interpretations in the recent past  and legal standards concerning validity  scope and interpretations of claims in biotechnology patents may continue to evolve 
even issued patents may later be modified or revoked by the us patent and trademark office  the european patent office or the courts in proceedings instituted by third parties 
moreover  the issuance of a patent in one country does not assure the issuance of a patent with similar claims in another country and claim interpretation and infringement laws vary among countries  so the extent of any patent protection is uncertain and may vary in different countries 
pharmaceuticals are not patentable in certain countries in sciclone s zadaxin territory  or have only recently become patentable  and enforcement of intellectual property rights in many countries in such territory has been limited or non existent 
future enforcement of patents and proprietary rights in many countries in sciclone s zadaxin territory can be expected to be problematic or unpredictable 
there can be no assurance that any patents issued or licensed to the company will provide it with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by others 
no assurance can be given that holders of patents licensed to the company will file  prosecute  extend or maintain their patents in countries where the company has rights 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar products or will not design around patents issued or licensed to the company 
government regulation and product approvals 
the research  preclinical and clinical development  manufacturing  marketing and sales of pharmaceuticals  including zadaxin  cpx and the company s other drug candidates  are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities 
products developed by the company cannot be marketed commercially in any jurisdiction in which they have not been approved 
the process of obtaining regulatory approvals is lengthy and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
in some countries where the company contemplates marketing zadaxin  the regulatory approval process for drugs not previously approved in countries that have established clinical trial review procedures is uncertain and this uncertainty may result in delays in granting regulatory approvals 
in addition  in certain countries such as japan  the process for obtaining regulatory approval is time consuming and costly because all clinical trials and most preclinical studies must be conducted there 
the company is currently sponsoring clinical trials and pursuing regulatory approvals of zadaxin in a number of countries and of cpx in the us  but there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete such trials  that such trials  if completed  will fulfill regulatory approval criteria or that the company will ultimately obtain approvals in such countries 
adverse results in the company s development programs also could result in the placement of restrictions on the use of zadaxin and cpx or revocation of the approval 
the marketing approval for zadaxin in singapore requires a patient surveillance program to continue study of the drug s safety and efficacy 
adverse results in such program could result in the placement of restrictions on the use of zadaxin or revocation of the approval in singapore 
failure to comply with the applicable us or foreign regulatory requirements can  among other things  result in warning letters  fines  suspensions of regulatory approvals  product recalls or seizures  operating restrictions  injunctions and criminal prosecutions 
further  additional government regulation may be established or imposed which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of zadaxin  cpx or any future products of the company 
manufacturing 
the company has entered into contract manufacturing and supply agreements to source zadaxin and cpx 
the company has experienced delays of supply of thymosin alpha bulk drug in the past and could do so again in the future 
to be successful  the company s products must be manufactured in commercial quantities in compliance with regulatory requirements and at an acceptable cost 
while the company believes it has and will be able in the future to establish manufacturing relationships with experienced suppliers capable of meeting the company s needs  there can be no assurance that the company will establish long term manufacturing relationships with suppliers or that these suppliers will prove satisfactory 
the company currently has vialing and packaging supply agreements in effect and has a sufficient supply of finished thymosin alpha for the near term and is currently negotiating a new vialing and packaging supply agreement 
no assurances can be given that such new agreement will be reached 
production interruptions  if they occur  could significantly delay clinical development of potential products  reduce third party or clinical researcher interest and support of proposed clinical trials 
such interruptions could also delay commercialization of the company s products and impair their competitive position  which would have a material adverse effect on the business and financial condition of the company 
see business manufacturing 
marketing and sales 
the company has established distribution arrangements with local pharmaceutical distribution companies covering countries  in asia  latin america and the middle east 
however  no assurance can be given that any such distribution arrangements will remain in place or prove successful 
see business marketing and sales 
technological change and competition 
rapid technological development may result in the company s products becoming obsolete before they are marketed or before the company recovers a significant portion of the related development and commercialization expenses 
competition in the pharmaceutical field is intense and the company expects that competition will increase 
the company s competitors include major pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology firms and universities and other research institutions  both in the us and abroad  that are actively engaged in research and development of products in the therapeutic areas being pursued by the company 
many of these companies and institutions have substantially greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing and human resource capabilities than the company and extensive experience in undertaking clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approvals necessary to market drugs 
principal competitive factors in the pharmaceutical field include efficacy  safety  and therapeutic regimen 
where comparable products are marketed by other companies price is also a competitive factor 
uncertainty of third party reimbursement  resources of patient populations 
the company s ability to successfully commercialize its products may depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of such products will be available from government health administration authorities  private health insurers and other organizations 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of new therapeutic products and there can be no assurance that third party reimbursement will be available for therapeutic products the company might develop 
in many of the foreign countries in which the company intends to operate  reimbursement of zadaxin under government or private health insurance programs will not be available 
in the us  health care reform is an area of increasing national attention and a priority of many governmental officials 
certain reform proposals  if adopted  could impose limitations on the prices the company will be able to charge in the us for its products or the amount of reimbursement for the company s products from governmental agencies or third party payors 
in many countries where the company has marketing rights for zadaxin  government resources and per capita income levels may be so low that the company s products will be prohibitively expensive for a large percentage of the population 
in such countries  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in marketing its products on economically favorable terms  if at all 
dependence on qualified personnel and key individuals 
because of the specialized scientific nature of the company s business  the company is highly dependent upon its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified management  scientific and technical personnel 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the areas of the company s activities  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of its business 
in addition  many key responsibilities within the company have been assigned to a relatively small number of individuals 
loss of the services of any of these individuals unless they were promptly replaced could be significantly detrimental to the company s development 
the company does not maintain key person life insurance on the lives of any of its key personnel 
product liability  absence of insurance 
the company s business will expose it to potential product liability risks which are inherent in the testing  manufacturing  marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products  and there can be no assurance that product liability claims will not be asserted against the company 
product liability insurance for the pharmaceutical industry generally is expensive to the extent that it is available at all 
the company has product liability insurance coverage for clinical trials and commercial sales 
however  there can be no assurance that a product liability claim would not adversely affect the business or financial condition of the company 
blank check preferred stock 
the company recently issued shares of series c preferred stock in a  financing 
see business recent developments 
the company s board of directors has the authority to issue additional series of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  without any further vote or action by the company s shareholders 
the rights of the holders of the common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of the outstanding voting stock of the company 
series c preferred stock 
under certain conditions  each share of the company s outstanding series c preferred stock may convert into more than one share of common stock 
if such events were to occur  the conversion of the preferred stock could have a dilutive effect on the common shareholders
