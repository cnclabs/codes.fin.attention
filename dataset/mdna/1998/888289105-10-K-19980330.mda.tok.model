item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company is an independent energy company engaged in the exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas properties 
the company s strategy is to grow reserves  production and net income per share through i the acquisition of producing properties that provide significant development and exploratory drilling potential  ii the exploitation and development of its reserve base  iii the exploration for oil and gas reserves  iv a low operating and overhead structure  and v acquiring companies which provide the previously mentioned opportunities 
the company has grown rapidly through the acquisition and exploitation of oil and gas properties  consummating the acquisition for a purchase price of approximately million  the acquisition for approximately million and the pioneer acquisition for approximately million 
in addition  the company issued  shares and  shares of the company s common stock in connection with the oedc acquisition and the carrollton acquisition  respectively 
the company s growth from acquisitions has impacted its financial results in a number of ways 
acquired properties may not have received focused attention prior to sale 
after acquisition  certain of these properties required extensive maintenance  workovers  recompletions and other remedial activity that while not constituting capital expenditures may initially increase lease operating expenses 
the company may dispose of certain of the properties it determines are outside the company s strategic focus 
the increased production and revenue resulting from the rapid growth of the company has required it to recruit and develop operating  accounting and administrative personnel compatible with its increased size 
as a result  the company has incurred and anticipates future increases in its general and administrative expense levels 
the company believes that with its current inventory of drilling locations and the anticipated additional staff it will be well positioned to follow a more balanced program of exploration and exploitation activities to complement its acquisition efforts 
titan uses the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas producing activities 
costs to acquire mineral interests in oil and gas properties  to drill and equip exploratory wells that result in proved reserves  and to drill and equip development wells are capitalized 
costs to drill exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves  and geological and geophysical costs are expensed 
costs of significant nonproducing properties  wells in the process of being drilled and significant development projects are excluded from depletion until such time as the related project is developed and proved reserves are established or impairment is determined 
the company s predecessor was classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
therefore  no income taxes were paid by the company prior to the conversion 
future tax amounts  if any  will be dependent upon several factors  including  but not limited to  the company s results of operations 
impact of declining crude oil prices during the quarter ended december   the posted price of west texas intermediate crude oil the west texas crude oil price fell from prices in excess of per barrel to prices of less than per barrel 
from december  through march   the west texas crude oil price ranged from to per barrel 
this decline in prices is thought to be caused primarily by an oversupply of crude oil inventory created  in part  by an unusually warm winter in the united states and europe  an announced increase in crude oil production quotas for opec countries and a possible decline in demand in certain asian markets 
if such a decline in the west texas crude oil price worsens or persists for a protracted period  it could adversely affect the company s revenues  net income and cash flows from operations 
also  if these prices maintain their present level for an extended time period or decline further the company may delay or postpone certain of its capital projects 
if the posted price for west texas crude oil price remains at current levels or continues to decline  the company would expect that it may be required to record an additional impairment of its oil and gas properties in the extent of an impairment  if any  cannot be determined 
year issues the company has reviewed the effect of the year issues relating to its information systems 
the company has determined that the year issues directly related to its information systems will not have a material impact on its business  operations nor its financial position 
however  the company cannot determine what effect  if any  the year issues affecting its vendors  customers  other businesses and the numerous local  state  federal and other us and foreign governmental entities with which it conducts business or which it is regulated or governed or taxed will have on its business or financial position

a reflects results of hedging activities 
results of operations the financial statements of the company  which began operations on march   include the results of the years ended december  and  and the nine months ended december  as a result of the company s limited operating history and rapid growth  its financial statements are not readily comparable and may not be indicative of future results 
the oedc acquisition  the carrollton acquisition and the pioneer acquisition did not contribute to the operating results of the company as the transactions did not close until the end of december year ended december  for the year ended december   the company s revenues from the sale of oil and gas excluding the effects of hedging activities were million and million  respectively 
during the year  the company produced  mbbls of oil and  mmcf of gas  with total oil and gas production of  mmcfe 
the revenues and production are primarily attributable to the acquisition  the acquisition  and the continued exploitation of the company s proved properties 
as a result of hedging activities in the year ended december   oil revenues were increased  
per bbl and gas revenues were reduced  
per mcf for a total increase of  oil and gas production costs  including production taxes  were million

for the year ended december  depletion  depreciation and amortization expense was million 
per mcfe 
this represents a full year of depletion relating to production for the acquisition and depletion related to the exploitation and development expenditures 
for the year ended december   the company recognized a pretax impairment related to its long lived assets of approximately million 
the impairment is primarily the result of i significantly lower commodity prices as compared to the economics on which the company acquired certain properties and ii downward adjustments of initially expected reserves on acquired and developed properties 
interest expense was  for the year ended december  the interest expense was attributable to bank financing incurred to fund capital expenditures

this represents a full year of depletion  depreciation and amortization relating to production for the acquisition and two months of depletion  depreciation and amortization relating to production for the acquisition 
interest expense was  for the year ended december  the interest expense was attributable to bank financing incurred primarily to fund the acquisition and the acquisition 
nine months ended december  for the nine months ended december   the company s revenues from the sale of oil and gas were  and  respectively 
during the period  the company produced mbbls of oil and mmcf of gas  for a total production of mmcfe 
the revenues and production are primarily attributable to the acquisition which was consummated december  oil and gas production costs including production taxes  were

liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of capital have been its initial capitalization  private equity sales  bank financing  cash flow from operations and the company s initial public offering 
the acquisition was funded with cash from the company s initial capitalization  additional private equity sales and bank financing 
the acquisition was principally funded with bank financing  which was repaid with the proceeds from the company s initial public offering 
the oedc acquisition and the carrollton acquisition were completed by issuing common stock in exchange for the equity interest in each entity 
the pioneer acquisition was funded with bank financing 
the company requires capital primarily for the exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas properties  the repayment of indebtedness and general working capital needs 
net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities  before changes in operating assets and liabilities  was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to the cash flow generated by the acquisition and from continued exploitation of the company s proved properties 
capital expenditures 
apart from the company s expenditure for the pioneer acquisition  the company budgeted for approximately million for the drilling and recompletion of oil and gas wells and workover projects on its proved properties and approximately million for expenditures for geological and geophysical costs  drilling costs and lease acquisition costs on the company s unproved properties 
cash expenditures for additions to oil gas properties were million for the year ended december  this includes million for the acquisition of oil and gas leases and million for development and exploratory drilling 
the company requires capital primarily for the exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas properties  the repayment of indebtedness and general working capital needs 
the following table sets forth costs incurred by the company in its exploration  development and acquisition activities during the periods indicated 
nine months ended year ended december  december  development costs    exploration costs  acquisition costs unproved properties 
  proved properties    total    for  the company expects to spend i approximately million to drill proved undeveloped properties  ii approximately million on probable projects  iii approximately million to explore unproven locations  iv approxmiately million on development projects following successful exploratory efforts  v approximately million to acquire additional acreage and seismic  vi million to fund development of pipeline and processing project investments and vii million on other items 
the final determination with respect to the drilling of any well  including those currently budgeted  will depend on a number of factors  including i the results of exploration efforts and the review and analysis of the seismic data  ii the availability of sufficient capital resources by the company and other participants for drilling prospects  iii economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling  including prevailing and anticipated prices for natural gas and oil and the availability and costs of drilling rigs and crews  iv the financial resources and results of the company  and v the availability of leases on reasonable terms and permitting for the potential drilling location 
there can be no assurance that the budgeted wells will encounter  if drilled  recompleted or worked over reservoirs of commercial quantities of natural gas or oil 
while the company regularly engages in discussions relating to potential acquisitions of oil and gas properties  the company has no present agreement  commitment or understanding with respect to any such acquisition  other than the acquisition of oil and gas properties and interests in its normal course business 
any future acquisitions may require additional financing and will be dependent upon financing which may be required in the future to fund the company s acquisition and drilling programs 
capital resources 
the company s primary capital resources are net cash provided by operating activities and the availability under the credit agreement  of which million was available at december  the pioneer acquisition of million was funded with proceeds from the credit agreement 
credit agreement 
the credit agreement established a four year revolving credit facility  up to the maximum amount of million  subject to a borrowing base to be redetermined semi annually by the lenders based on certain proved oil and gas reserves and other assets of the company 
the borrowing base at december  was million 
to the extent that the borrowing base is less than the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding loans and letters of credit under the credit agreement  such deficiency must be cured by the company ratably within days  by either prepaying a portion of the outstanding amounts under the credit agreement or pledging additional collateral to the lenders 
a portion of the credit facility is available for the issuance of up to million of letters of credit  of which  was outstanding at december  all outstanding amounts under the credit agreement are due and payable in full on january  the company s outstanding long term debt under the credit agreement was million on december  at the company s option  borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at either the base rate ie  the higher of the applicable prime commercial lending rate  or the federal funds rate plus 
per annum or the eurodollar rate  plus to per annum  depending on the level of the company s aggregate outstanding borrowings 
in addition  the company is committed to pay quarterly in arrears a fee of 
to 
of the unused borrowing base 
the credit agreement contains certain covenants and restrictions that are customary in the oil and gas industry 
in addition  the line of credit is secured by substantially all of the company s oil and gas properties 
liquidity and working capital 
at december   the company had million of cash and cash equivalents as compared to million at december  the company s ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at december   compared to at december  due principally to a reduction in cash as a result of an intentional change in the way the company manages its operating accounts  the company s working capital decreased million from million at december  to  at december  unsecured credit agreement 
in april  the company entered into a credit agreement the unsecured credit agreement with texas commerce bank national association the bank  which establishes a revolving credit facility  up to the maximum of million 
all outstanding amounts pursuant to the unsecured credit agreement are due and payable in full on or before december  proceeds of the unsecured credit agreement are utilized to fund short term needs less than thirty days 
the company had no outstanding debt under the unsecured credit agreement at december  the interest rate of amounts outstanding under the unsecured credit agreement is at a rate determined by agreement between the company and the bank 
the rate shall not exceed the maximum interest rate permitted under applicable laws 
interest rates generally are the bank s cost of funds plus per annum 
other matters stock options and compensation expense in connection with the conversion  the company issued options to purchase  shares of common stock to certain of its officers and employees in substitution for options issued by titan resources  lp of the options issued by the partnership approximately were issued on march   the date of inception  and approximately were issued as of september  the options issued by the company have an exercise price of per share 
options to purchase  shares of common stock are currently vested and an additional  and  shares will vest on march of each of and  respectively 
based in part on selling prices of interests in the partnership in december and september  the company expected to record a noncash compensation expense of approximately  per month for a period of months beginning in october of to reflect the estimated value of the revised option plan on september  noncash compensation expense recorded for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively  and  for the period ended december  during the years ended december  and the company issued additional stock options of  and  respectively  for which no deferred compensation was recorded as these options had no implicit value when issued 
hedging activities the company uses swap agreements and other financial instruments in an attempt to reduce the risk of fluctuating oil and gas prices and interest rates 
the company is party to various agreements with numerous counterparties for purposes of utilizing financial instruments  of which the company assesses the creditworthiness of its counterparties 
among other counterparties  the company has utilized enron capital trade resources corp 
an affiliate of a significant stockholder of the company as a counterparty 
settlement of gains or losses on the hedging transactions was generally based on the difference between the contract price and a formula using new york mercantile exchange nymex or other major indices related prices and was reported as a component of oil and gas revenues as the associated production occurs 
the company  at december   had entered into hedging transactions with respect to approximately  mmcfe of its estimated production 
subsequent to december  and through march   the company has entered into additional hedging transactions  relating to its estimated production  of approximately  mmcfe at prices ranging from to per mcf

the company recorded a reduction of  to gas revenues  which had no significant effect on the average gas price  for the year ended december   as a result of its commodity hedges 
during the year ended december   the company reported average gas prices of per mcf  while realizing average prices  excluding hedging results  of per mcf 
the company recorded net decreases to gas revenues of  
per mcf for the year ended december   as a result of its commodity hedges 
natural gas balancing in the natural gas industry  various working interest partners produce more or less than their entitlement share of natural gas from time to time 
the company s net overproduced position at december  was  mcf 
under terms of typical natural gas balancing agreements  the underproduced party can take a certain percentage  typically to of the overproduced party s entitled share of gas sales in future months  to eliminate such imbalances 
during the make up period  the overproduced party s cash flow will be adversely affected 
the company recognizes revenue and imbalance obligations under the entitlements method of accounting  which means that the company recognizes the revenue to which it is entitled and records a liability with respect to the value of the overproduced gas 
environmental and other laws and regulations the company s business is subject to certain federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the exploration for and the development  production and transportation of oil and gas  as well as environmental and safety matters 
many of these laws and regulations have become more stringent in recent years  often imposing greater liability on a larger number of potentially responsible parties 
although the company believes it is in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  the requirements imposed by such laws and regulations are frequently changed and subject to interpretation  and the company is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on its operations 
the company has no material commitments for capital expenditures to comply with existing environmental requirements 
nevertheless  changes in existing environmental laws or in interpretations thereof could have a significant adverse impact on the operating costs of the company  as well as the oil and gas industry in general

cautionary statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company or its representatives may make forward looking statements  oral or written  including statements in this report  press releases  public and private forums and filings with the sec  regarding estimated future net revenues from oil and natural gas reserves and the present value thereof  planned capital expenditures including the amount and nature thereof  increases in oil and gas production  the number of wells the company anticipates drilling through in connection with its capital expenditure plans and the company s financial position  business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in these forward looking statements are reasonable  there can be no assurance that the actual results or developments anticipated by the company will be realized or  even if substantially realized  that they will have the expected effects on its business or operations 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations are general economic conditions  inherent uncertainties in interpreting engineering data  operating hazards  delays or cancellations of drilling operations for a variety of reasons  competition  fluctuations in oil and gas prices  the ability of the company to successfully integrate the business and operations of acquired companies  government regulations and other factors including but not limited to those set forth among the risk factors noted below or in the description of the company s business in item of this report 
all subsequent oral and written forward looking statements attributable to the company or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these factors 
the company assumes no obligation to update any of these statements 
risk factors volatility of oil and gas prices 
the company s revenues  operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent upon the prices received for the company s oil and gas 
historically  the markets for oil and gas have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future 
revenues generated from the oil and gas operations of the company will be highly dependent on the future prices of oil and gas 
various factors beyond the control of the company will affect prices of oil and gas  including but not limited to the worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and gas  the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls  political instability or armed conflict in oil producing regions  the price and level of foreign imports  the level of consumer demand  the price and availability of alternative fuels  the availability of pipeline capacity  weather conditions  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes and the overall economic environment 
on march   the posted price for west texas intermediate crude was per bbl  as posted by the company s major purchaser 
on december   the posted price for west texas intermediate crude was per bbl  as posted by the company s major purchaser 
the company is unable to predict the long term effects of these and other conditions on the prices of oil 
moreover  it is possible that prices for any oil the company produces will be lower than current prices received by the company 
historically  the market for natural gas has been volatile and is likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
prices for natural gas are subject to wide fluctuation in response to market uncertainty  changes in supply and demand and a variety of additional factors  all of which are beyond the company s control 
on march   estimated natural gas prices received by the company at the wellhead averaged per mcf 
on december   natural gas prices received by the company at the wellhead averaged per mcf 
lower oil and gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and gas the company can produce economically 
any significant decline in the price of oil or gas would adversely affect the company s revenues and operating income and may require a reduction in the carrying value of the company s oil and gas properties 
uncertainty of reserve information and future net revenue estimates 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and their values  including many factors beyond the company s control 
the reserve information set forth in this report represents estimates only 
although the company believes such estimates to be reasonable  reserve estimates are imprecise and should be expected to change as additional information becomes available 
estimates of oil and gas reserves  by necessity  are projections based on engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and of future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies and assumptions concerning future oil and gas prices  future operating costs  severance and excise taxes  development costs and workover and remedial costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of oil and gas attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of the future net cash flows expected therefrom may vary substantially 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the company s reserves will ultimately be produced or that the company s proved undeveloped reserves will be developed within the periods anticipated 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the company s reserves 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to the company s reserves will likely vary from estimates  and such variances may be material 
the pv referred to in this report should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated oil and gas reserves attributable to the company s properties 
in accordance with applicable requirements  the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate  whereas actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower 
actual future net cash flows also will be affected by factors such as the amount and timing of actual production  supply and demand for oil and gas  curtailments or increases in consumption by gas purchasers and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves  and thus their actual present value  will be affected by the timing of both the production and the incurrence of expenses in connection with development and production of oil and gas properties 
in addition  the discount factor  which is required to be used to calculate discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with the company or the oil and gas industry in general 
limited operating history  rapid growth 
the company  which began operations in march  has a brief operating history upon which the company s stockholders may base their evaluation of the company s performance 
as a result of its brief operating history and rapid growth  the operating results from the company s historical periods are not readily comparable and may not be indicative of future results 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to experience growth in  or maintain its current level of  revenues  oil and gas reserves or production 
the company s rapid growth has placed significant demands on its administrative  operational and financial resources 
any future growth of the company s oil and gas reserves  production and operations would place significant further demands on the company s financial  operational and administrative resources 
the company s future performance and profitability will depend in part on its ability to successfully integrate the administrative and financial functions of acquired properties and companies into the company s operations  to hire additional personnel and to implement necessary enhancements to its management systems to respond to changes in its business 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in these efforts 
the inability of the company to integrate acquired properties and companies  to hire additional personnel or to enhance its management systems could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
substantial capital requirements 
the company makes  and will continue to make  substantial capital expenditures for the exploration  development  acquisition and production of its oil and gas reserves 
the company intends to finance such capital expenditures primarily with funds provided by operations and borrowings under its million credit agreement  which currently has a borrowing base of million  against which million had been drawn as of march  in  the company spent approximately million on its first large property acquisition  in  approximately million on its second large property acquisition  and in  approximately million on its third large property acquisition 
in  the company issued i  shares of common stock in connection with the acquisition of oedc  which focuses on the exploration  development and production of natural gas and on natural gas gathering  processing and marketing activities  primarily in the gulf of mexico  and ii  shares of common stock in connection with the acquisition of carrollton resources  llc  a small independent energy company engaged in the exploration and development of onshore oil and gas properties located primarily in the gulf coast region 
the company s direct capital expenditures for oil and gas producing activities  excluding property acquisitions  were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and million for the nine months ended december  if revenues decrease as a result of lower oil or gas prices or otherwise  the company may have limited ability to expend the capital necessary to replace its reserves or to maintain production at current levels  resulting in a decrease in production over time 
if the company s cash flow from operations and availability under the credit agreement are not sufficient to satisfy its capital expenditure requirements  there can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available to meet these requirements 
reserve replacement risk 
the company s future success depends upon its ability to find  develop or acquire additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
the proved reserves of the company will generally decline as reserves are depleted  except to the extent that the company conducts successful exploration or development activities or acquires properties containing proved reserves  or both 
in order to increase reserves and production  the company must continue its development and exploration drilling and recompletion programs or undertake other replacement activities 
the company s current strategy includes increasing its reserve base through acquisitions of producing properties  continued exploitation of its existing properties and exploration of new and existing properties 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s planned development and exploration projects and acquisition activities will result in significant additional reserves or that the company will have continuing success drilling productive wells at low finding and development costs 
furthermore  while the company s revenues may increase if prevailing oil and gas prices increase significantly  the company s finding costs for additional reserves could also increase 
drilling and operating risks 
drilling activities are subject to many risks  including well blow outs  cratering  uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas or well fluids  fires  formations with abnormal pressures  pollution  releases of toxic gases and other environmental hazards and risks  any of which could result in substantial losses to the company 
the company s offshore operations are also subject to the additional hazards of marine operations such as severe weather  capsizing and collision 
in addition  the company incurs the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be encountered through its drilling operations 
there can be no assurance that new wells drilled by the company will be productive or that the company will recover all or any portion of its investment in wells drilled 
drilling for oil and gas may involve unprofitable efforts  not only from dry wells  but from wells that are productive but do not produce net reserves to return a profit after drilling  operating and other costs 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating wells is often uncertain 
the company s drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors  many of which are beyond its control  including economic conditions  mechanical problems  title problems  weather conditions  compliance with governmental requirements and shortages and delays in the delivery of equipment and services 
acquisition risks 
the company s rapid growth since its inception in march has been largely the result of acquisitions of producing properties 
the company expects to continue to evaluate and pursue acquisition opportunities available on terms management considers favorable to the company 
the successful acquisition of producing properties involves an assessment of recoverable reserves  future oil and gas prices  operating costs  potential environmental and other liabilities and other factors beyond the company s control 
this assessment is necessarily inexact and its accuracy is inherently uncertain 
in connection with such an assessment of the subject properties  the company performs a review it believes to be generally consistent with industry practices 
this review  however  will not reveal all existing or potential problems  nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and capabilities 
inspections may not be performed on every well  and structural and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken 
the company generally assumes preclosing liabilities  including environmental liabilities  and generally acquires interests in the properties on an as is basis 
with respect to its acquisitions to date  the company has no material commitments for capital expenditures to comply with existing environmental requirements 
there can be no assurance that the company s acquisitions will be successful 
any unsuccessful acquisition could have a material adverse effect on the company 
risk of hedging activities 
the company s use of energy swap arrangements and other financial instruments to reduce its sensitivity to oil and gas price volatility is subject to a number of risks 
if the company s reserves are not produced at the rates estimated by the company due to inaccuracies in the reserve estimation process  operational difficulties or regulatory limitations  the company would be required to satisfy obligations it may have under fixed price sales and hedging contracts on potentially unfavorable terms without the ability to hedge that risk through sales of comparable quantities of its own production 
further  the terms under which the company enters into fixed price sales and hedging contracts are based on assumptions and estimates of numerous factors such as cost of production and pipeline and other transportation costs to delivery points 
substantial variations between the assumptions and estimates used by the company and actual results experienced could materially adversely affect the company s anticipated profit margins and its ability to manage the risk associated with fluctuations in oil and gas prices 
additionally  fixed price sales and hedging contracts limit the benefits the company will realize if actual prices rise above the contract prices 
in addition  fixed price sales and hedging contracts are subject to the risk that the counter party may prove unable or unwilling to perform its obligations under such contracts 
any significant nonperformance could have a material adverse financial effect on the company 
as of december    mmcfe of the company s production was subject to hedging contracts 
marketability of production 
the marketability of the company s production depends in part upon the availability  proximity and capacity of natural gas gathering systems  pipelines and processing facilities 
most of the company s natural gas is delivered through gas gathering systems and gas pipelines that are not owned by the company 
federal and state regulation of oil and gas production and transportation  tax and energy policies  changes in supply and demand and general economic conditions all could adversely affect the company s ability to produce and market its oil and gas 
any dramatic change in market factors could have a material adverse effect on the company 
compliance with environmental regulations 
the company s operations are subject to complex and constantly changing environmental laws and regulations adopted by federal  state and local governmental authorities 
the implementation of new  or the modification of existing  laws or regulations could have a material adverse affect on the company 
discharge of oil  gas or other pollutants into the air  soil or water may give rise to significant liabilities on the part of the company to the government and third parties and may require the company to incur substantial costs of remediation
