aircraft fuel expenses include both the direct costs of the fuel as well as the cost of delivering fuel into the aircraft 
fuel expense  on a per asm basis  was lower for than due to the lower market price of fuel 
fuel cost in total increased due to a increase in consumption due to the increase in asms 
the average price of fuel decreased in from per gallon to per gallon 
in  fuel cost per gallon increased to per gallon up from in the increase in the price per gallon of fuel in accounts for the increase in fuel cost per asm from to maintenance expenses include all administrative costs of the maintenance department as well as normal recurring maintenance performed during the year 
most non routine maintenance costs performed during the suspension of operations are included in the shutdown and nonrecurring expense line item

certain maintenance administrative costs were also incurred during the period of the suspension of operations during with no asms being generated over which to spread these costs causing a higher cost per asm in than station operations expenses include all expenses incurred at the airports  as well as station operations administration and liability insurance 
station operations expenses were higher  on a per asm basis  for the years ended december  and than in due largely to the reduced number of asms flown  the suspension of operations and inefficiencies generated from restarting operations 
many of the station facilities were not fully utilized during the fourth quarter of and during a portion of due to the limited operations 
of the stations operated by the company prior to its suspension of operations  were restarted during and eight during certain facility rental expenses related to non operating stations as a result of the suspension of operations  are included in shutdown and other nonrecurring expenses

the company did not pay bonuses during as a result of generating operating losses for the year

depreciation expense for the year ended december  was higher than each of the previous two years due to the return to operating status of aircraft which were previously idled or held for disposition and due to additional capital spending primarily to purchase and install hush kits to meet stage noise requirements 
depreciation on idled aircraft  as a result of the suspension of operations and reduced operations  was recorded in shutdown and other nonrecurring expenses 
all of these aircraft were reactivated during during  the company made the decision to ground and dispose of certain idled aircraft

personnel costs include full wages  salaries and benefits that were provided to idled employees during the reduction and suspension of operations 
the decrease in shutdown and other nonrecurring expenses is primarily due to the resumption of operations in september and the related increasing service levels 
no significant shutdown expenses are expected to be incurred going forward 
a summary of such costs is as follows in thousands year ended december maintenance   legal and other   depreciation   facilities rental  wages  salaries and benefits  excluding maintenance  faa remediation  no accrual was provided for costs to be incurred in future periods related to aircraft depreciation and maintenance and rental costs associated with temporarily idled facilities as such costs will be recognized as they are incurred

as of december   the company s operating fleet consisted of mcdonnell douglas dc aircraft and boeing aircraft 
during  the company sold its remaining mcdonnell douglas md aircraft and dc aircraft 
the company currently leases two dc aircraft to other carriers and has seven aircraft being reactivated from non operating status 
the company has contracted with boeing successor to mcdonnell douglas for the purchase of b aircraft  at a cost of approximately billion subject to adjustments for inflation  for delivery in to approximately million of this amount will be paid in progress payments during and the balance of the purchase price after all progress payments will be paid upon delivery of each aircraft 
if the company exercises its option to acquire up to an additional b aircraft  additional payments could be required beginning in the company expects to finance at least of the cost of each of these aircraft 
although boeing has agreed to provide assistance with respect to the financing of aircraft to be acquired  the company will be required to obtain the financing from other sources 
the company believes that with the assistance to be provided by boeing  aircraft related debt financing should be available when needed 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to obtain sufficient financing on attractive terms 
if it is unable to do so  the company could be required to modify its aircraft acquisition plans or to incur higher than anticipated financing costs  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and cash flows

the company expects that faa certified hush kits will cost approximately million for its remaining non hushed dc and b aircraft 
any disposition of stage aircraft would reduce this obligation 
the company may be able to finance a portion of the cost of these hush kits and plans to make the balance of payments on these hush kits out of its working capital 
the company expects to pay the debt service on such loans out of cash flow generated from operations during the term of the financing 
the phase in period for full compliance with stage until december  and the expected terms of financing  if available  should allow the company to spread the payments for stage compliance over a number of years

the plaintiffs seek unspecified damages based upon the decrease in market value of shares of the company s stock 
although management of the company intends to defend these actions vigorously and believes that the suits are without merit  any litigation contains elements of uncertainty and there can be no assurance that the company will not sustain material liability under such or related lawsuits 
numerous lawsuits have also been filed against the company seeking damages attributable to the deaths of those on flight  and additional lawsuits are expected 
the company s insurance carrier has assumed defense of these lawsuits under a reservation of rights 
as all claims are handled independently by the company s insurance carrier  the company cannot reasonably estimate the amount of liability which might exist 
as a result  no accruals for losses or the related claim for recovery from the company s insurance carrier have been reflected in the company s financial statements 
the company maintains million of liability insurance per occurrence with a major group of independent insurers that provide facilities for all forms of aviation insurance for many major airlines 
although the company believes  based on the information currently available to it  that such coverage is sufficient to cover claims associated with this accident and that the insurers have sufficient financial strength to pay claims  there can be no assurance that the total amount of judgments and settlements will not exceed the amount of insurance available therefor or that all damages awarded will be covered by insurance

nevertheless  the company has implemented a year compliance program to ensure that the company s computer systems and applications will perform properly beyond in addition to the internal review  the company has received assurance from its major computer system vendors that their applications are year compliant 
the company believes that the year issue will not pose any significant operational problems 
maintenance or modification costs associated with making existing changes  if needed  will be expensed as incurred 
the company s business relies on government agencies and other third parties eg  department of transportation  federal aviation administration  airport authorities  data suppliers 
the ability of third parties  upon whom the company relies  to adequately address their year issues is outside the company s control 
there can be no assurance that the systems of the third parties will be modified on a timely basis 
the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the failure of those systems and applications  licensed to or operated for third parties  or operated by other parties to properly operate on dates beyond item a
