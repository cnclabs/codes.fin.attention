seasonality the following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly data for the periods shown mar 
june sept 
dec 
mar 
june sept 
dec 
net sales         gross profit         historically  the company s sales  in the aggregate  generally have been higher in the period from march to september  the period during which sunglass use is typically highest 
as a result  operating margins are typically lower in the first and fourth quarters  as fixed operating costs are spread over generally lower sales volume 
in anticipation of seasonal increases in demand  the company typically builds inventories in the fourth quarter and first quarter when net sales have historically been lower 
in addition  the company s shipments of goggles  which generate gross margins at significantly lower levels than sunglasses  are lowest in the second quarter 
this seasonal trend contributes to the company s gross margin in the second quarter  which historically has been the highest of the year 
although the company s business generally follows this seasonal trend  the success of the company s products introduced since late and the company s international expansion have partially mitigated the impact of seasonality 
backlog historically  the company has generally shipped domestic orders other than preseason orders for ski goggles and orders from certain sunglass specialty chains within one day of receipt and international orders within two weeks of receipt 
at december   the company had a backlog of million  including backorders merchandise remaining unshipped beyond its scheduled shipping date of million as of such date 
in september  the company implemented changes in its replenishment system with sunglass hut  which affected its reported backlog 
under the new system  in an effort to more closely match inventory replenishment with sunglass hut s sales  certain high volume oakley products are shipped to sunglass hut weekly  based on the previous week s retail sales 
as a result  sunglass hut will no longer place future shipment orders for these products except in anticipation of major seasonal sales increases 
these changes reduced the company s reported backlog at september  and december  and will continue to do so for future periods 
these system enhancements are the result of the joint efforts of the two companies to achieve the long term benefits of lower overall inventory levels  while increasing inventory turns and sales at retail 
inflation the company does not believe inflation has had a material impact on the company in the past  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case in the future

although the company is not aware of any material operational issues or costs associated with preparing its internal systems for the year  there can be no assurance that there will not be a delay in  or increased costs associated with  the implementation of the necessary systems and changes to address the year issues  and the company s inability to implement such systems and changes could have an adverse effect on future results of operations
