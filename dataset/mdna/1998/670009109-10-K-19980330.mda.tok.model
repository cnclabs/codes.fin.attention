item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general from inception through  the company primarily engaged in the research and development of transdermal drug delivery systems 
during this period  the company s revenues were principally generated by license fees  milestone payments pursuant to various license agreements and interest earned on funds raised through the sale of its common stock 
in  due to the receipt of regulatory approvals for its transdermal estrogen delivery system  a significant portion of the company revenues were derived from the sale of this product to the company s two licensing partners

although in market sales on noven s estrogen delivery systems continue to increase on a global basis  noven experienced lower product sales during as compared to as the inventory levels of its licensee partners and the distribution channels diminished without resupply 
noven anticipates increased product sales in  however losses are expected for due to the fact that product sales still will not be sufficient to offset operating costs  which will include significant research and development expenditures 
noven expects that revenues from product sales to its licensing partners will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year depending upon various factors not in noven s control  including  but not limited to  the inventory requirements of each licensing partner at different times throughout the year  possible special selling efforts undertaken by each licensing partner at different times during the year  and  in the case of rpr the introduction of menorest and the estrogen progestogen combination delivery system into new territories
