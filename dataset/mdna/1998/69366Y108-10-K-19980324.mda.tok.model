since pacific was not acquired by the company until july   operating results may not be comparable with prior years 
pro forma results  reflecting operations as if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of are provided in note of the financial statements 
a discussion of the pro forma results are made whenever it is deemed to enhance the reader s understanding of the company s operating results 
the company posted record net sales in  rising from to and by from to higher sales volumes  primarily due to an increase in production capacities  were responsible for the growth in revenues 
higher sales volumes  primarily due to the acquisition of pacific  were responsible for the growth in revenues 
pounds sold rose by from to and by from to these higher volumes were partially offset by lower selling prices  which decreased from to and from to the lower selling prices in were caused by increased competition due to over capacity in the industry  while the lower selling prices in were primarily due to lower pvc resin prices 
on a pro forma basis  sales in dollars decreased from to  while sales in pounds increased 
the small pro forma sales increase in pounds is due to capacity constraints at the company s three manufacturing facilities 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales from to is primarily due to a combination of higher resin prices during the first half of and lower selling prices during pvc resin prices were approximately higher from to much of the pvc resin price increases were driven by a tight supply of resin during the first quarter of  caused by various operational problems within many of the resin producers  not by an increase in demand 
therefore  the company was unable to pass all of the raw material price increases on to its customers during the first half of the lower selling prices were due to pvc resin prices peaking earlier than usual in resin prices peaked in may  compared to the more traditional fall winter price descent in september of to maintain its market share  the company was required to lower its prices at the same rate that raw material prices declined 
as higher priced inventory was sold at lower market prices  gross profits decreased significantly 
the increase in the gross profit as a percentage of net sales from to is primarily due to the stabilization of pvc and pe raw material costs and selling prices during operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased from to primarily due to administrative efficiencies within the company which were partially offset by higher freight costs resulting from expanded geographic markets 
operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased from to primarily due to lower selling prices in which were partially offset by administrative efficiencies gained from the acquisition of pacific 
operating expenses as a percentage of sales on a pro forma basis were for the increase in operating expenses from pro forma results to is due to lower selling prices in compared to the decrease in non operating expenses  which consists mainly of interest expense  as a percentage of net sales from to is the result of paying down the revolving credit loan with the proceeds from the sale of redeemable preferred stock in may interest expense decreased in compared to as a result of the company s refinancing of debt along with the issuance of new common equity in may  which allowed the company to eliminate of its higher interest rate subordinated debt and related non cash interest amortization 
the income tax provisions for  and  were calculated based upon management s estimate of the annual effective rates  reduced by federal net operating loss nol and state tax credit carryforwards utilized as well as nol carryforwards expected to be used in future periods

at december   the company had million of working capital 
cash generated from operating activities was  in  compared to million and million in and  respectively

the company used million  million  and million for investing activities in   and  respectively 
the primary uses of cash were capital expenditures in and and the purchase of pacific in capital expenditures increased substantially in and due to the addition and replacement of manufacturing equipment at all three of the company s manufacturing facilities

outlook 
the statements contained in this outlook are based on current expectations 
these statements are forward looking  and actual results may differ materially from those anticipated by some of the statements made herein 
the company expects the demand for plastic pipe to grow as acceptance of plastic pipe over metal pipe continues and the overall economy continues to grow 
industry growth projections call for annual sales growth rates for plastic pipe of three percent or greater per year through the company has historically been able  and expects in the future to be able  to grow at rates substantially in excess of the industry averages due to its emphasis on customer satisfaction  product quality and differentiation and innovative promotional programs 
the company s strategy has been  and continues to be  to concentrate growth initiatives in higher profit products and geographic regions 
the company s gross margin percentage is a sensitive function of pvc and pe raw material resin prices and capacity levels in the industry 
in a rising or stable resin market  margins and sales volume have historically been higher and conversely  in falling resin markets  sales volumes and margins have historically been lower 
gross margins also suffer when capacity increases outpace demand due to increased competition to utilize capacity 
the company believes that there currently is over capacity in the plastic pipe industry 
due to the commodity nature of pvc and pe resin and the dynamic supply and demand factors worldwide  it is very difficult to predict gross margin percentages or assume that historical trends will continue 
the company does not anticipate any events in the foreseeable future that would hinder the availability of the federal nols 
the nols are available through the year  however  the majority expire by the year the amount of available nols actually used will be dependent on future profits 
the company does not expect to utilize all of its nols before they expire 
the company believes that it has the product offerings  facilities  personnel  and competitive and financial resources for continued business success 
however future sales  costs  margins  and profits are all influenced by a number of factors  as discussed above 
as with other organizations  the company s computer programs were originally designed to recognize calendar years by their last two digits 
calculations performed using these truncated fields would not work properly with dates from the year and beyond 
the company has initiated efforts to remedy this situation and expects all programs to be corrected and tested prior to the year the incremental costs of this project will not have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
in addition  the company has communicated with others with whom it does significant business to determine their year compliance readiness and the extent to which the company is vulnerable to any third party year issues 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
statements relating to the company s expectation of the plastic pipe and tubing market  and the company s performance in relation to such growth  the company s ability to utilize nols in the future and its belief that it has the necessary resources for future success are all forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to  raw material cost fluctuations  general economic conditions  competition  availability of working capital and weather conditions
