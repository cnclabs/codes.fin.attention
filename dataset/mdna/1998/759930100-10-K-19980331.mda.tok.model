item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview renal care group is a specialized provider of nephrology services to patients with kidney disease  including patients suffering from chronic kidney failure 
the company commenced operations in february when it acquired the founding companies simultaneous with the completion of its initial public offering 
as of december  the company provided dialysis and ancillary services to approximately  patients through outpatient dialysis centers in states  in addition to providing acute dialysis services in hospitals 
for the comparison discussion that follows  the selected combined financial and pro forma statements include the financial information of the founding companies  and previously reported acquisitions accounted for as poolings of interests 
one such pooling of interests  renalwest  was organized in september  consequently  the selected combined financial and pro forma statements do not include a full year of operating results for that period 
because the founding companies and acquired entities were independent and not operated by company s management prior to their respective dates of acquisition  the historical results prior to such times may not be indicative of future performance 
in addition  the selected combined and pro forma financial statements do not give effect to any operating efficiencies prior to such dates of acquisition that the company believes typically would be obtainable in an integrated organization 
the company s net revenue has been derived primarily from the following sources i outpatient hemodialysis services  ii ancillary services associated with dialysis  primarily the administration of epo  iii home dialysis services  iv inpatient hemodialysis services provided pursuant to contracts with acute care hospitals and skilled nursing facilities  v management contracts with hospital based and medical university dialysis programs  and vi laboratory services 
esrd patients typically receive dialysis treatments per year  with reimbursement for services provided primarily by the medicare esrd program based on rates that are established by hcfa 
for the year ended december   approximately of the company s net revenue was derived from reimbursement under the medicare and medicaid programs 
medicare reimbursement is subject to rate and other legislative changes by congress and periodic changes in regulations  including changes that may reduce payments under the esrd program 
for patients with private health insurance  dialysis had been historically reimbursed at rates higher than medicare during the first months of treatment  after which time medicare becomes the primary payor 
however  effective september   the health insurance coordination period has been extended to months of treatment  after which time medicare becomes the primary payor 
reimbursement for dialysis services provided pursuant to a hospital contract is negotiated with the individual hospital and generally is higher on a per treatment equivalent basis than the medicare rate 
because dialysis is a life sustaining therapy used to treat this chronic disease  utilization is predictable and is not subject to seasonal fluctuations 
results of operations as indicated elsewhere  in february the company commenced its business with the simultaneous acquisition of the five founding companies
