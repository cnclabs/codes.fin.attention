the increase in absolute dollars resulted from increased marketing support for existing dial and renuzit branded products  introductory marketing expenses for renuzit candles and the dial ultra skin care line  and  to a lesser extent  increased administrative costs associated with being a public company  offset in part by lower trade promotion expenses that were no longer necessary due to the purex price reduction

factors that may affect future results and financial condition the company s future results and financial condition are dependent upon the company s ability to successfully develop  manufacture and market consumer products 
inherent in this process are a number of factors that the company must successfully manage to achieve favorable future operating results and financial condition 
potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the company s future operating results and financial condition include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below 
intense competition in the consumer products industry the consumer products industry  particularly its detergent  personal care and air freshener categories  is intensely competitive 
several of the company s most significant competitors  including the procter gamble company  lever brothers co 
a division of unilever plc  and colgate palmolive company  have greater financial resources than the company and may be willing to commit significant resources to protecting their own market shares or to capturing market share from the company 
as a result  the company may need to incur greater costs than previously incurred for trade and consumer promotions and advertising to preserve or improve market share and to introduce and establish new products and line extensions 
at the same time  the company may need to undertake additional production related cost cutting measures to enable it to respond to competitors price cuts and marketing efforts without reducing the company s margins 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to make such additional expenditures or implement such cost cutting measures or that if made or implemented they will be effective 
consumer pricing pressures consumer products  particularly those that are value priced  are subject to significant price competition 
from time to time  the company may need to engage in price cutting initiatives for some of its products to respond to competitive and consumer pressures 
the failure of the company s sales volumes to grow sufficiently to improve overall revenues and income as a result of a competitive price reduction could have a material adverse effect on the financial performance of the company 
trade customer pricing pressures  competitive retail environment the company faces pricing pressures from its trade customers 
because of the competitive retail environment  retailers have increasingly sought to reduce inventory levels and obtain pricing concessions from vendors 
in addition  because consumer products companies  including the company  have historically offered end of quarter discounts to achieve quarterly sales goals  trade customers have been inclined to delay inventory restocking until quarter end 
over the past months  the company has reduced end of quarter discounts to retailers and has changed its sales incentive structure to emphasize not only quarterly revenue targets but also trade spending management and other personal performance targets 
the reduction in discounts has not had and the company believes it will not have a material adverse effect on sales although there can be no assurance in that regard 
the company is also subject to the risk that high volume customers could seek alternative pricing concessions or better trade terms 
the company s performance is also dependent upon the general health of the retail environment and could be materially adversely affected by changes therein and by the financial difficulties of retailers 
dependence of key customers the company s top ten customers accounted for of net sales in wal mart stores inc and its affiliate  sam s club wal mart was the company s largest customer  accounting for of the company s net sales in the loss of  or a substantial decrease in the volume of purchases by  wal mart or any of the company s other top customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
price volatility of raw materials  single source supplier while the company believes that it may  in certain circumstances  be able to respond to price increases for certain raw materials by increasing sales prices  rapid increases in the prices of such raw materials could have a material adverse impact on financial results 
for example  tallow a key ingredient in dial bar soaps has experienced price fluctuations within the range of and per pound from january  to december  recently  the price of tallow has been trading near the lower end of this historical range 
because the majority of the competitors soap products use considerably less tallow in their bar soap products  the company may not be able to increase the prices of its dial bar soaps in response to increases in tallow prices 
in addition  the antibacterial agent  triclosan  which is the active ingredient used in liquid dial products  is sourced from a single supplier 
although the company has an adequate supply of triclosan for its current and foreseeable needs  a significant disruption in this supply could have a short term material adverse impact on the company s financial results 
the company seeks to mitigate the risk by entering into contracts to provide up to six month supplies of tallow  triclosan and packaging materials 
long term hedging opportunities against price increases for these items are generally not available 
dependence on domestic markets  risks associated with international expansion while a number of the company s competitors have diversified their revenues to include a strong international component  the company is currently dependent primarily on sales generated in the us of sales in 
with respect to a number of the company s most significant product categories  including detergents and bar soaps  the us markets are mature and characterized by high household penetration 
the company s unit sales growth in these domestic markets will depend on increasing usage by consumers and capturing market share from competitors 
there can be no assurance that the company will succeed in implementing its strategies to achieve such domestic growth 
to reduce its dependence on domestic revenues  the company has adopted a strategy to further penetrate international markets 
in implementing this strategy  the company faces barriers to entry and the risk of competition from local and other companies that already have established global businesses  risks generally associated with conducting business internationally  including exposure to currency fluctuations  limitations on foreign investment  import export controls  nationalization  unstable governments and legal systems and the additional expense and risks inherent in operating in geographically and culturally diverse locations 
because the company plans to develop its international business through acquisitions as well as joint ventures  co packaging arrangements and or other alliances  the company may also be subject to risks associated with such acquisitions  ventures  arrangements and alliances  including those relating to the marriage of different corporate cultures and shared decision making 
in addition  because the company s current international distribution capabilities are extremely limited  the company will also need to acquire a distribution network or enter into alliances with existing distributors before it can effectively conduct operations in new markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will succeed in increasing its international business in a profitable manner  and a failure to expand this business may have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company has a significant number of registered foreign trademarks as well as pending foreign trademark applications 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully register any foreign trademarks for which applications are currently pending or that such trademarks  once registered  together with any existing registered foreign trademarks  will be protected in the foreign markets in which they are used 
adverse publicity  product recalls certain news broadcasts by major us television and radio networks have focused on the use of antibacterial agents to kill germs on various surfaces 
triclosan  the active ingredient in liquid dial  has also been a focus of these broadcasts 
although none of the broadcasts disputed that triclosan kills germs on the skin  some third party experts did question whether it provides any additional protection beyond that provided by non antibacterial soap products 
although the company has test results that it believes prove that triclosan provides consumers with additional protection in limiting exposure to bacteria related diseases  there can be no assurance that the adverse publicity stemming from these broadcasts will not adversely affect the company s sales of its antibacterial soap products and its results of operations 
because the company shares the use of the armour trademark for food products with conagra inc  the manufacturer of armour branded non canned meat products  the company faces the risk that consumer preferences and perceptions with respect to any of the company s armour products may be influenced by adverse publicity affecting any of the armour branded products of conagra  inc from time to time  consumer product companies  including dial  have had to recall certain products for various reasons  which costs of recall or other liabilities could be material to such companies 
to date  the company has not made any product recalls that have been material to the company s financial condition 
in addition  adverse publicity regarding any such product recalls could have a material adverse effect on the company 
environmental concerns regarding detergent compound nonlyphenol ethoxylate npe is an ingredient used in the company s liquid and powder detergent products 
certain environmental and regulatory groups have raised concerns regarding the toxicity of compounds produced from npe as it decomposes and the adverse impact on the reproductive health of certain aquatic animals  exposed to those compounds 
although to the best of the company s knowledge none of the studies undertaken on npe have demonstrated a link between the compound and such effect in the environment or in human beings  there can be no assurance that subsequent studies will in fact demonstrate such a link or demonstrate other adverse environmental consequences 
current government regulations do not impose any restrictions on the use of npe  or impose any liability on any of the businesses that utilize npe in the products they manufacture 
the company believes  however  that a number of governmental agencies in north america and europe are discussing formal regulations of npe in the environment 
the company is in the process of reformulating its detergents to eliminate this compound as an ingredient 
the additional expense the company expects to incur as a result of this reformulation is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results 
in addition  the company believes that it will not incur any significant environmental liability as a result of the use of npe in its products 
dependence on key personnel the operation of the company requires managerial expertise 
of the company s key personnel  only the chief executive officer has an employment contract with the company 
there can be no assurance that any of the company s key employees will remain in the company s employ 
the loss of such key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
turnover  employee relations primarily as a result of the restructuring of its business  the company discharged approximately salaried and non salaried employees during and in addition  the company experienced greater aggregate voluntary turnover of salaried employees in and than the industry average 
although the company believes that it presently has sufficient staffing  there can be no assurance that the company would not be materially adversely affected by any future significant voluntary turnover of salaried or other employees 
four of the company s six plants in the us are unionized 
the company s contracts with its various unions are scheduled for renegotiation as follows i international brotherhood of teamsters covering approximately employees at the company s st 
louis  missouri plant in july  ii oil  chemical and atomic workers union covering approximately employees at the company s bristol  pennsylvania plant in may  iii united food and commercial workers union covering approximately employees at the company s aurora  illinois plant in august  and iv the united food and commercial workers union covering approximately employees at the company s fort madison  iowa plant in september there can be no assurance that these contracts can be renegotiated on terms acceptable to the company 
in  the company s st 
louis  missouri plant experienced a five week work stoppage 
although the company believes that its relations with the employees at this plant and other plants are satisfactory  there can be no assurance that the company will not face similar labor disputes in the future or that such disputes will not be material to the company 
environmental matters the company is subject to a variety of environmental and health and safety laws in each jurisdiction in which it operates 
these laws and regulations pertain to the company s present and past operations 
since  the company has received notices or requests for information with respect to sites that have been deemed superfund sites under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  five of which are currently active  of which are inactive  and eight of which have been settled 
the company is also engaged in investigatory and remedial activities with respect to four closed plants previously operated by former parent 
as of january   the company has accrued in its financial statements approximately million in reserves for expenses related to superfund sites and the clean up of closed plant sites  which reserves it believes are adequate 
the company does not anticipate that the costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations or the costs related to superfund sites and the clean up of closed plant sites will have any material adverse effect on the company s capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position  however  there can be no assurance that other developments  such as the emergence of unforeseen claims or liabilities or the imposition of increasingly stringent laws  regulations and enforcement policies will not result in material costs in the future 
risks of potential acquisitions the company may acquire or make substantial investments in complementary businesses or products in the future 
any such acquisition or investment would entail various risks  including the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired business or products  the potential disruption of the company s ongoing business and  generally  the potential inability of the company to obtain the desired financial and strategic benefits from the acquisition or investment 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results 
future acquisitions and investments by the company also could result in substantial cash expenditures  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities  and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  which could adversely affect the company s financial results and condition 
the company engages from time to time in discussions with respect to potential acquisitions  some of which may be material 
year compliance many existing computer systems and software products  including several used by the company  are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
beginning in the year  these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  the company s date critical functions related to the year and beyond  such as sales  distribution  manufacturing  purchasing  inventory control  trade promotion management  planning and replenishment  facilities and financial systems may be materially adversely affected unless these computer systems are or become year compliant 
the company has begun a comprehensive upgrade of its information systems to significantly improve operating efficiencies and to identify  correct or reprogram  and test its systems for year compliance 
in  the company incurred costs of million to upgrade its information technology and expects to spend an additional million over the next two years for such upgrades 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s computer systems will be year compliant in a timely manner or that the company will not incur significant additional expenses pursuing year compliance 
furthermore  even if the company s systems are year compliant  there can be no assurance that the company will not be materially adversely effected by the failure of others to become year compliant 
for example  the company may be adversely affected by the disruption or inaccuracy of data provided to the company by non year compliant third parties and the failure of the company s customers and service providers  such as independent shipping companies  to become year compliant 
there can be no assurance that the year problem will not have a material adverse effect on the company in the future
