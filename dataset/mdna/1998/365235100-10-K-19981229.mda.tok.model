general the company has grown from restaurants in to salad buffet restaurants as of september  of the restaurants  are located in southern california using the name souplantation and the balance are located in northern california  florida  arizona  new mexico  utah  nevada  washington  georgia and texas using the name sweet tomatoes 
the company s existing restaurants average approximately  square feet  however  newer restaurants are based on the company s latest  sq ft prototype 
the company currently leases the sites for most of its restaurants  mixed between in line locations and stand alone sites  although the company purchases sites when necessary to acquire desirable locations 
net sales reflect discounts and coupons 
cost of sales consists primarily of food and beverage costs 
food costs can vary significantly depending upon pricing and availability of produce and grocery items 
the company attempts to minimize cost fluctuations for some of its foods by entering into two month to one year fixed price supply contracts with no minimum purchase requirements 
restaurant operating expenses include all restaurant level operating costs  the significant components of which are direct and indirect labor expenses including benefits  advertising expenses  occupancy costs and maintenance and utility expenses 
occupancy and other operating costs include rent  real estate taxes and insurance 
certain elements of the company s restaurant operating expenses and  in particular  occupancy costs  are relatively fixed 
however  a significant majority of the company s leases provide for periodic escalation of minimum annual rentals based upon increases in the consumer price index 
occupancy costs  as well as depreciation and amortization expenses  will vary between restaurants depending on whether a restaurant site is leased or owned

quarterly results and seasonality the following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly results and the percentage that certain items in the company s statements of operations bear to net sales for the four quarters of fiscal and the company believes that this unaudited quarterly information includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments and accruals  necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown

a restaurant is included in this computation after it has been open for full calendar months 
as a result  a restaurant may be included in this computation for only a portion of a given quarter or year 
the company s restaurants experience seasonal influences  as a disproportionate amount of the company s net income is realized during the second  third and fourth fiscal quarters due to higher average sales and lower average costs 
quarterly results have fluctuated and are expected to continue to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including the timing of new restaurant openings  and are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources the company finances its cash requirements principally from cash flow from operating activities  bank debt  mortgage and capital lease financings and sale of common stock 
the company does not have significant receivables or inventory  and receives trade credit based upon negotiated terms when purchasing food and supplies 
for the year ended september   the company generated million in cash flow from operating activities  received million from bank debt and mortgage and capital lease financings offset by payments of million  and received million from the sale of the company s common stock pursuant to stock options and the company s employee stock purchase plan and the consummation of a secondary public offering of the company s common stock 
as of september   the company had available all of its million bank line of credit 
such credit line bears interest at the bank s reference rate plus  which totaled per annum as of september  the credit agreement expires on november  and contains various financial covenants and restrictions  including restrictions on the company s ability to pay dividends or to effect mergers or acquisitions without the bank s approval 
borrowings under the line of credit are collateralized by equipment and other assets 
in connection with the development of new restaurants  the company has over time obtained mortgage and capital lease financing from approximately nine lenders  each of which has financed multiple loans or leases 
the outstanding balance of each loan or lease generally is between  and million 
the loans and leases have varying maturity rates extending through april  interest rates generally ranging from approximately through with an average interest rate of approximately per annum  and in certain cases  pre payment penalties of one to two percent 
as of september   the outstanding balances on such loans and leases aggregated approximately million 
the company s principal capital requirement has been and will continue to be funding the development of restaurants 
for year ended september   capital expenditures totaled million  million of which funded the development of new restaurants 
the remaining capital expenditures primarily funded replacements and new additions at existing restaurants 
in addition to budgeted capital expenditures for fiscal of million for new restaurant openings  the company has budgeted million in expenditures for fiscal for capital improvements at existing sites 
see business unit economics 
the company believes that i internally generated funds  ii available borrowings under the bank credit line and iii funds that it will be able to borrow pursuant to secured credit facilities consistent with its past practices  will be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements through at least the end of fiscal if these sources of financing are insufficient to satisfy the company s liquidity requirements  the company may be required to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities 
there is no assurance that financing will be available to the company on favorable terms  or at all 
computer systems and year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
certain information technology systems and their associated software it systems  and certain equipment that utilizes programmable logic chips to control aspects of their operation embedded chip equipment  may recognize as the year  as the year  etc 
the year issue could result  at the company and elsewhere  in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or to engage in other normal business activities 
the company s state of readiness 
the company is addressing the year issue  including efforts relating to it systems and embedded chip equipment used within the company  efforts to assess issues the company faces if third parties who do business with the company are not prepared for the year  and contingency planning 
the company has determined that its proprietary accounting and management information software  and the hardware upon which it runs  is year compliant  however  certain third party software will require updates or replacement  which are scheduled for implementation during the first quarter of the company will complete its review of embedded chip equipment by the end of january   and will be year compliant by mid the company s operations are also dependent on the year readiness of third parties who do business with the company 
in particular  the company s it systems interact with commercial electronic transaction processing systems to handle customer credit card purchases  and the company is dependent on third party suppliers of such infrastructure elements including  but not limited to  telephone service  electric power  water and banking services 
although the company has not been put on notice that any known third party problem will not be resolved  the company has limited information and no assurance of the year readiness of third parties 
the company has used and continues to use internal resources to identify  correct  upgrade or replace and test internally deployed it systems and embedded chip equipment for year compliance 
costs 
the company did not incur significant cost to enable its proprietary accounting and management information software  and the hardware upon which it runs  to be year compliant 
the company believes that the cost of modifying the standard  non proprietary software will be borne by the licensors  and accordingly does not believe it will incur significant costs with respect to such year compliance 
aggregate costs for year issues have been and are estimated to be below  and are being expensed as incurred 
risks 
the company intends and expects to implement the changes necessary to address the year issue for it systems and embedded chip equipment used within the company 
the company presently believes that  with modifications to existing software  conversions to new software  and appropriate remediation of embedded chip equipment  the year issue is not reasonably likely to pose significant operational problems for the company s it systems and embedded chip equipment so modified and converted 
however  if unforeseen difficulties arise or such modifications  conversions and replacements are not completed timely  or if the company s vendors or suppliers systems are not modified to become year compliant  the year issue may have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is presently unable to assess the likelihood that the company will experience significant operational problems due to unresolved year problems of third parties who do business with the company 
there can be no assurance that other entities will achieve timely year compliance  if they do not  year problems could have a material impact on the company s operations 
similarly there can be no assurance that the company can timely mitigate its risks to a supplier s failure to resolve its year issues 
if such mitigation is not achievable  year problems could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s estimates of the costs of achieving year compliance and the date by which year compliance will be achieved are based on management s best estimates  which were derived using numerous assumptions about future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
the company presently believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios that the company might confront with respect to year issues have to do with a decline in business due to consumer preoccupation with media and news reports of actual or anticipated events and actual events over which the company has no control  including  but not limited to  failure of power  water and telephone service  or problems experienced by other companies without any connection to the company 
if the company experiences loss of power or similar services in any affected geographic area  the company would be forced to temporarily close stores 
contingency plans 
the company has a small number of suppliers who provide the majority of the company s inventory  including fresh produce and grocery staples 
the company believes these suppliers are or will be year compliant by june of as part of the company s normal contingency planning  it has identified alternative suppliers 
however  there can be no assurance that there will be no disruption of supply resulting in the company s inability to maintain operations 
in the event that the parties from whom the company licenses software do not achieve year compliance in a timely manner  the company believes that it can acquire alternative software that is compliant and that performs substantially the same function as its current software  without significant cost 
additionally  in the event the company needs to replace equipment which uses embedded systems  the company believes it can do so without significant cost 
impact of inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting the company s operations include food and beverage and labor costs 
the company does not believe that inflation has materially affected earnings during the past four years 
substantial increases in costs and expenses  particularly food  supplies  labor and operating expenses  could have a significant impact on the company s operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to guests 
new accounting standard in april  the accounting standards executive committee issued statement of position sop  reporting on the costs of start up activities 
this sop requires that the costs of start up activities  which is inclusive of pre opening costs  should be expensed as incurred 
this new accounting standard is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  earlier application is encouraged in fiscal years for which annual financial statements have not been issued 
restatement of previously issued financial statements is not permitted 
as is typical in the restaurant industry  the company defers its restaurant pre opening costs and amortizes them over the twelve month period following the opening of each respective restaurant 
at september   total deferred pre opening costs were million 
for fiscal and  preopening expense amortization was approximately million and million  respectively 
the company will adopt sop in fiscal upon adoption in fiscal  the company will recognize the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  net of any related income tax effect 
while total cash flows are unaffected by this change  pre opening costs previously reported as cash used in investing activities will be reported as a component of net cash provided by operating activities 
business risks in addition to other information in this form k  shareholders and prospective investors should consider carefully the following factors in evaluating the company and its business 
certain operating results and considerations in fiscal  and  the company experienced an increase of  and respectively  in comparable restaurant sales 
the company s newer restaurants have not historically experienced significant increases in guest volume following their initial opening period 
in addition  the company does not believe it has significant latitude to achieve comparable restaurant sales growth through price increases 
as a result  the company does not believe that recent comparable restaurant sales is indicative of future trends in comparable restaurant sales 
the company believes that it may from time to time in the future experience declines in comparable restaurant sales  and that any future increases in comparable restaurant sales may be modest 
see selected financial data and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
expansion risks the company opened seven salad buffet restaurants in each of fiscal  fiscal and eight in fiscal the company currently intends to open fifteen restaurants in fiscal the company s ability to achieve its expansion plans will depend on a variety of factors  many of which may be beyond the company s control  including the company s ability to locate suitable restaurant sites  negotiate acceptable leases or purchase terms  obtain required governmental approvals  construct new restaurants in a timely manner  attract  train and retain qualified and experienced personnel and management  operate its restaurants profitably and obtain additional capital  as well as general economic conditions and the degree of competition in the particular region of expansion 
the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  delays in restaurant openings from time to time 
in addition  since its inception  the company has closed three non performing restaurants 
given the number of restaurants in current operation and the company s projected expansion rate  there can be no assurances that the company will not close restaurants in the future 
any closure could result in a significant write off of assets which could adversely effect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company incurs substantial costs in opening a new restaurant and  in the company s experience  new restaurants experience fluctuating operational levels for some time after opening 
owned restaurants generally require significantly more up front capital than leased restaurants 
as a result  an increase in the percentage of owned restaurant openings as compared to historical practice would increase the capital required to meet the company s growth plans 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully expand into new regions or that the company s existing or new restaurants will be profitable 
the company has encountered intense competition for restaurant sites  and in many cases has had difficulty buying or leasing desirable sites on terms that are acceptable to the company 
in many cases  the company s competitors are willing and able to pay more than the company for sites 
the company expects these difficulties in obtaining desirable sites to continue for the foreseeable future 
see restaurant industry and competition  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  business expansion strategy and business competition 
restaurant industry and competition the restaurant industry is highly competitive 
key competitive factors in the industry include the quality and value of the food products offered  quality of service  price  dining experience  restaurant location and the ambiance of the facilities 
the company s primary competitors include mid price  full service casual dining restaurants  as well as traditional self service buffet and other soup and salad restaurants and healthful and nutrition oriented restaurants 
the company competes with national and regional chains  as well as individually owned restaurants 
the number of buffet and casual restaurants with operations generally similar to the company s has grown substantially in the last several years and the company believes competition among buffet style and casual restaurants has increased and will continue to increase as the company s competitors expand operations in various geographic areas 
such increased competition could increase the company s operating costs or adversely affect its revenues 
the company believes it competes favorably in the industry  although many of the company s competitors which have been in existence longer than the company  have a more established market presence and have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than the company  which may give them certain competitive advantages 
in addition  the restaurant industry has few non economic barriers to entry 
therefore  there can be no assurance that third parties will not be able to successfully imitate and implement the company s concept 
the company has encountered intense competition for restaurant sites  and in many cases has had difficulty buying or leasing desirable sites on terms that are acceptable to the company 
in many cases  the company s competitors are willing and able to pay more than the company for sites 
the company expects these difficulties in obtaining desirable sites to continue for the foreseeable future 
cost sensitivity the company s profitability is highly sensitive to increases in food  labor and other operating costs 
the company s dependence on frequent deliveries of fresh produce and groceries subjects it to the risk that shortages or interruptions in supply caused by adverse weather or other conditions could materially adversely affect the availability  quality and cost of ingredients 
in addition  unfavorable trends or developments concerning factors such as inflation  food  labor and employee benefit costs including increases in hourly wage and minimum unemployment tax rates  rent increases resulting from the rent escalation provisions in the company s leases  and the availability of experienced management and hourly employees may also adversely affect the company 
the company believes recent relatively favorable inflation rates and part time labor supplies in its principal market area have contributed to relatively stable food and labor costs in recent years 
however  there can be no assurance that these conditions will continue or that the company will have the ability to control costs in the future 
see reliance on key suppliers and distributors  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business 
importance of key employees the company is heavily dependent upon the services of its officers and key management personnel involved in restaurant operations  purchasing  expansion and administration 
in particular  the company is dependent upon the management and leadership of its three executive officers  michael p 
mack  david w 
qualls and r 
gregory keller 
the loss of any of these three individuals could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the success of the company and its individual restaurants depends upon the company s ability to attract and retain highly motivated  well qualified restaurant operations and other management personnel 
the company faces significant competition in the recruitment of qualified employees 
see business restaurant operations restaurant management and business restaurant operations customer service 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations the company s business experiences seasonal fluctuations as a disproportionate amount of the company s net income is generally realized in the second  third and fourth fiscal quarters due to higher average sales and lower average costs 
quarterly results have fluctuated and are expected to continue to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including the timing of new restaurant openings 
as a result of these factors  net sales and net income on a quarterly basis may fluctuate and are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations quarterly results and seasonality 
geographic concentration in california  restaurant base twenty eight of the company s existing salad buffet restaurants are located in california 
accordingly  the company is susceptible to fluctuations in its business caused by adverse economic or other conditions in this region  including natural disasters or other acts of god that could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s significant investment in  and long term commitment to  each of its restaurant sites limits its ability to respond quickly or effectively to changes in local competitive conditions or other changes that could affect the company s operations 
in addition  the company has a small number of restaurants relative to some of its competitors 
consequently  a decline in the profitability of an existing restaurant or the introduction of an unsuccessful new restaurant could have a more significant effect on the company s result of operations than would be the case in a company with a larger number of restaurants 
see business restaurant facilities and business expansion strategy 
reliance on key suppliers and distributors the company utilizes sole source suppliers for certain produce and grocery items 
in addition  in order to minimize price fluctuations  the company enters into fixed price supply contracts that typically have terms of two months to one year and generally do not have minimum purchase requirements 
however  in the event that the company s suppliers are unable to make the required deliveries due to shortages or interruptions caused by adverse weather or other conditions or are relieved of their contract obligations due to an invocation of an act of god provision  the company would need to renegotiate these contracts or purchase such products and groceries elsewhere 
there can be no assurance that the company s produce and grocery costs would not as a result be higher  and such higher costs could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial conditions and results of operations 
the company has several local produce distributors that are governed by one program and two main grocery distributors 
all produce and groceries purchased by the company are channeled from the growers and other suppliers to the company s restaurants and restaurant commissaries through these distributors 
in the event that any of these distributors were to cease distribution on behalf of the company  the company would be required to make alternate arrangements for produce and grocery distribution 
there can be no assurance that the company s distribution expense would not be greater under such alternate arrangements

legal matters the company is from time to time the subject of complaints  threat letters or litigation from guests alleging illness  injury or other food quality  health or operational concerns 
adverse publicity resulting from such allegations may materially adversely affect the company and its restaurants  regardless of whether such allegations are valid or whether the company is liable 
the company is party to various legal actions relating to former employees 
in the opinion of management  after reviewing the information which is currently available with respect to these matters  and consulting with the company s counsel  any liability which may ultimately be incurred will not materially affect the financial position or results of operations of the company

government regulation the company s business is subject to and affected by various federal  state and local laws 
each restaurant must comply with state  county and municipal licensing and regulation requirements relating to health  safety  sanitation  building construction and fire prevention
