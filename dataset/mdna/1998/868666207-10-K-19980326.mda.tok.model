the increase in average interest earning assets was offset by an increase in average interest bearing liabilities from million to million 
the company experienced an increase in the net interest margin of basis points from to for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the foregoing increase resulted principally from the fact that the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased by basis points while the yield on interest earning assets remained unchanged at for and the company s net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  referred to as a volume change 
it is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing deposits and other borrowed funds  referred to as a rate change 
the net yield on total interest earning assets from to remained unchanged at

the company determines separate general allowances for insurance premium financing and non insurance premium financing loans 
the company s loss experience on insurance premium financing lending was adversely affected during the second half of by the failure of a non best rated insurance company 
the company has implemented certain changes in its lending policies and procedures with respect to insurance premium financing lending which have reduced the maximum concentration by insurance carrier except as approved by the board of directors and have also reduced the amount of loans collateralized by unearned premiums of insurance policies written by non rated carriers 
see item business insurance premium financing 
the company recorded a  provision for credit losses during the year ended december  compared with  in   in   in and  in the increase in the provision when compared with was necessary to keep pace with loan growth and to accrue for potential losses on the two ipf lawsuits 
the increase in the provision when compared with was necessitated by the growth in the loan portfolio 
provision for medical claims receivables losses the amount of the provision for medical claims receivables losses is based on periodic not less than quarterly evaluations of the medical claims receivables portfolio  with particular attention directed toward nonperforming and other potential problem medical claims receivables 
during these evaluations  consideration is given to such factors as management s evaluation of specific medical claims receivables  the level and composition of nonperforming medical claims receivables  historical loss experience  results of examinations by regulatory agencies  an internal asset review process  concentrations of credits  and other judgmental factors 
the company s loss experience on medical claims receivables factoring was adversely affected during the fourth quarter of by an increase in the amount of medical claims receivables outstanding greater than days since funding date 
as of december   the company had approximately million of medical claims receivables outstanding days or more from the date of funding by the company  or of its total medical claims receivables 
at december  the company had approximately million of medical claims receivables  of total medical receivables  outstanding days or more 
it has been the company s experience that  historically  approximately of its medical claims receivables were collected within to days 
therefore  approximately of such receivables would remain outstanding after days 
the company believes that the increase in the proportion of medical claims receivables outstanding after days resulted primarily because the company did not increase staffing for collections commensurate with the growth in medical claims receivables 
management s fourth quarter and year end evaluation of surety capital s medical claims factoring portfolio  indicated that at december    in medical receivables were outstanding over days 
consequently  management determined that charge offs of  of the  were warranted in the fourth quarter as well as a provision for an additional  of such receivables 
upon recognition of the charge offs and additional reserves for the factored receivables  the company believes that it was adequately reserved for all receivables greater than days outstanding since funding date 
new management of the medical claims factoring division was in place by the end of january the new management has made a commitment to vigorously pursue collecting the portfolio of outstanding receivables over days old 
at this time  however  the company can not predict the likely amount of any such recoveries 
the company has decreased the level of acquisition of new medical claims receivables 
the company could incur losses in its medical receivables factoring business for a number of reasons  including fraud and the failure of the insurance company or the government agency to pay the receivable for any reason 
the company generally has no recourse against the health care provider for payment of a medical receivable which is not otherwise paid  although the company generally obtains and perfects a security interest in all medical receivables of that health care provider to secure payment of the receivables 
therefore  payments on any other receivable in excess of the balance due the bank regarding that receivable may  under certain circumstances  be applied to an unpaid receivable 
medical receivables factoring  like insurance premium financing  is a specialty type of financing which provides high yields and requires specialized expertise and systems 
the company considers the market for this type of financing to be relatively broad  and to extend beyond the local markets served by the company s branches 
noninterest income noninterest income is generated primarily from fees associated with noninterest and interest bearing accounts as well as fees associated with loans eg  late fees 
noninterest income for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or compared with noninterest income of  for the year ended december  the increase in noninterest income is attributed to the increase in average insurance premium finance loans outstanding during of  when compared to the average balance outstanding during of  insurance premium finance generates most of its noninterest income from late fees 
late fees for the year ended were  as compared  for the same period during noninterest income for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or compared with noninterest income of  for the year ended december  the increase in noninterest income is attributed to the acquisition of first midlothian corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary  first national bank  midlothian  texas  during  as well as an increase in loans outstanding 
the acquisition of first national bank increased the number and balance of loans outstanding along with the number and balance of noninterest and interest bearing deposit accounts  which resulted in increased noninterest income 
the following table sets forth the various categories of noninterest income for the years ended december   and noninterest income years ended december  noninterest income nonsufficient fund charges    late fee charges    service charges    collection fees    credit life insurance    secured credit card annual fee   other    total noninterest income    noninterest expense noninterest expense was  for the year ended december   an increase of  or compared with noninterest expense of  for the year ended december  this increase resulted principally from the decision by the company s management to recognize an impairment for goodwill relating to the factoring division during in the amount of  and certain fixed assets within the factoring division in the amount of  additionally  the company s management decided that it was necessary to accrue approximately  for the preparation of the planned registration statement during the fourth quarter of and this amount was treated as professional fees 
the remaining balance of the increase related to professional fees associated with the proposed acquisition of texstar as well as additional staffing associated with the acquisition of first national  midlothian and the increase in staffing required by the medical claims receivables division 
noninterest expense was  for the year ended december   an increase of  or compared with noninterest expense of  for the year ended december  this increase resulted principally from the acquisition of first midlothian corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary  first national bank  and providers funding corporation 
the addition of first national bank and providers funding corporation resulted in additional personnel  occupancy and office expenses 
the amortization of intangibles increased in as a result of the addition of goodwill and costs in the amount of  associated with the acquisition of first national bank and the addition of goodwill and costs in the amount of  associated with the acquisition of providers funding corporation 
deposits held by the bank are insured by the bank insurance fund bif of the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
the fdic assessment is calculated on the level of deposits held by the bank 
the bif assessment rate is determined by the fdic for categories of banks based upon the risk to the insurance fund 
on august  the fdic s board of directors voted to significantly reduce the deposit insurance premiums paid by most banks 
under this structure which became effective september  the best rated institutions insured by the bif paid per of domestic deposits  down from the rate of per effective january the fdic s board of directors voted again to reduce the deposit insurance premiums paid by most banks 
under the new rate structure  assessments ranged from zero to per of domestic deposits  subject to a minimum annual assessment of  under this structure  in the bank was assessed at a zero rate and paid the minimum assessment rate of  in november  the fdic s board of directors voted to retain the existing bif assessment schedule for  but eliminated the minimum assessment amount  and approved an assessment against bif assessable deposits to be paid to the financing corporation fico to assist in paying interest on fico bonds  which financed the resolution of the thrift industry crisis 
the fico assessment is approximately basis points on bif insured deposits 
the first quarter fico assessment for the bank is approximately  see item business supervision and regulation 
noninterest expense years ended december  salaries and employee benefits    occupancy and equipment    general and administrative expense professional fees    office supplies    travel and entertainment    telephone    advertising    postage    amortization of intangibles    dues and subscriptions    insurance    credit cards   bank service charge    fdic assessment    credit reports    other    total general and administrative    impairment of long lived assets  total noninterest expense    income taxes the company and the bank will file a consolidated tax return for the company estimates that its effective tax rate for will be approximately and has recognized income tax benefit of  on a loss before taxes of  for the year ended december  as compared with income tax expense of  or an effective tax rate of on income before taxes of  for the year ended december  interest rate sensitivity management the operating income and net income of the bank depend  to a substantial extent  on rate differentials ie  the differences between the income the bank receives from loans  securities and other earning assets  and the interest expense it pays to obtain deposits and other liabilities 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors which are beyond the control of the bank  including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities 
the objective of monitoring and managing the interest rate risk position of the balance sheet is to contribute to earnings and to minimize the adverse changes in net interest income 
the potential for earnings to be affected by changes in interest rates is inherent in a financial institution 
interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and changes in net interest income due to the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
an asset sensitive position in a given period will result in more assets being subject to repricing  therefore  as interest rates rise  such a position will have a positive effect on net interest income 
conversely  in a liability sensitive position  where liabilities reprice more quickly than assets in a given period  a rise in interest rates will have an adverse effect on net interest income 
one way to analyze interest rate risk is to evaluate the balance of the interest rate sensitivity position 
a mix of assets and liabilities that are roughly equal in volume and term and repricing represents a matched interest rate sensitivity position 
any excess of assets or liabilities in a particular period results in an interest rate sensitivity gap 
the following table presents the interest rate sensitivity for the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities months months year months to to to over or less months year years years total interest earning assets interest earning deposits in financial institutions   investment securities       federal funds sold   loans       medical claims receivable     interest earning assets       interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand deposits savings deposits   time deposits      interest bearing liabilities      period interest sensitivity gap       cumulative interest sensitivity gap       cumulative gap as a percent of total assets cumulative interest sensitive assets as percent of cumulative interest sensitive liabilities the cumulative rate sensitive gap position at one year was an asset sensitive position of million  or a positive 
accordingly  the company believes it will not experience a significant impact from changes in interest rates 
the company undertakes this interest rate sensitivity analysis to monitor the potential risk to future earnings from the impact of possible future changes in interest rates on currently existing net assets or net liability positions 
however  this type of analysis is as of a point in time  when in fact the company s interest rate sensitivity can quickly change as market conditions  customer needs  and management strategies change 
thus  interest rate changes do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or at the same time 
the company s investment policy does not permit the purchase of derivative financial instruments or structured notes 
the preceding table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the company s net interest income because the repricing of certain assets and liabilities is discretionary and is subject to competitive and other pressures 
at december   the bank held  in mortgage backed securities 
although the mortgage backed securities have a stated maturity greater than five years  it is not uncommon for mortgage backed securities to fully pay down well ahead of stated maturities 
as a result  assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within the same period may  in fact  reprice at different times and at different rate levels 
analysis of financial condition loans and asset quality the company s loans are diversified by borrower and industry group 
loan growth has occurred every year over the past five years and can be attributed to acquisitions  increased loan demand and the addition of new lending products 
the following table describes the composition of loans by major categories outstanding at december     and loan portfolio and medical claims receivables analysis december  aggregate principal amount loans insurance premium financing      commercial loans      installment loans      real estate loans      total loans      less unearned interest      allowance for credit losses      total loans  net      medical claims receivables medical claims receivables  net of unearned interest      allowance for medical claims receivables losses      total medical claims receivables  net      percentage of loan portfolio loans insurance premium financing commercial loans installment loans real estate loans total the concentration of insurance premium financing loans may expose the bank to greater risk of loss than would a more diversified loan portfolio

stated loan maturities including floating rate loans reset to market interest rates of the total loan portfolio  net of unearned income  as of december  were stated loan maturities one within year to after one five five year years years total stated loan maturities floating rates reset insurance premium financing   commercial and real estate loans     total     medical claims receivable   rate sensitivities of the total loan portfolio before unearned income as of december  were as follows loan repricing one year after within to five five one year years years total fixed rate     variable rate    non accrual    total     the maturities presented above are based upon contractual maturities 
many of these loans are made on a short term basis with the possibility of renewal at time of maturity 
all loans  however  are reviewed on a continuous basis for creditworthiness 
nonperforming assets the company s financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting  including the recognition of interest income on its loan portfolio  unless a loan is placed on a nonaccrual basis 
loans are placed on a nonaccrual basis when there are serious doubts regarding the complete collectibility of principal and interest 
amounts received on nonaccrual loans generally are applied first to principal and then to interest after all principal has been collected 
troubled debt restructurings are those for which concessions  including reduction of interest rates or deferral of interest or principal  have been granted  due to a borrower s weakened financial condition 
interest on restructured loans is accrued at the restructured rates when it is anticipated that no loss of original principal will occur 
it is the policy of the bank not to renegotiate the terms of a loan simply because of a delinquent status 
rather  a loan is generally transferred to a nonaccrual status if it is not in the process of collection and is delinquent in payment of either principal or interest beyond days 
loans which are days delinquent but are well secured and in the process of collection are not included in nonperforming assets 
other nonperforming assets consist of real estate acquired through loan foreclosures  other workout situations and other assets acquired through repossessions or medical factoring receivables aged beyond days since the initial funding 
the following table summarizes nonperforming assets by category as of december  and nonperforming assets nonaccrual loans   loans days past due and still accruing interest   total nonperforming loans   medical claims receivable aged beyond days   other real estate owned and other assets   total nonperforming assets   nonperforming assets to total assets nonperforming loans to total loans the classification of a loan on nonaccrual status does not necessarily indicate that the principal is uncollectible  in whole or in part 
a determination as to collectibility is made by the bank on a case by case basis 
the bank considers both the adequacy of the collateral and the other resources of the borrower in determining the steps to be taken to collect nonaccrual loans 
the final determination as to these steps is made on a case by case basis 
alternatives that are considered are foreclosure  collecting on guarantees  restructuring the loan or collection lawsuits

the allowance for credit losses represents the company s estimate of the allowance necessary to provide for losses incurred in the loan portfolio 
in making this determination  the company analyzes the ultimate collectibility of the company s loan portfolio  incorporating feedback provided by the internal loan review staff and provided by examinations performed by regulatory agencies 
the company makes an ongoing evaluation as to the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
to establish the appropriate level of the allowance  all loans including nonperforming loans  commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are reviewed and classified as to potential loss exposure 
specific allowances are then established for those loans  commitments to extend credit or standby letters of credit with identified loss exposure and an additional allowance is maintained based upon the size  quality  and concentration characteristics of the remaining loan portfolio using both historical quantitative trends and the company s evaluation of qualitative factors including future economic and industry outlooks 
the determination by the company of the appropriate level of allowance amount  excluding medical receivables factoring  was  at december  the allowance for credit losses is based on estimates  and ultimate losses will vary from current estimates 
these estimates are reviewed monthly and as adjustments  either positive or negative  become necessary they are reported in earnings in the periods in which they become known

the allowance is utilized as a single unallocated allowance available for all loans 
the following allocation table should not be interpreted as an indication of the specific amounts or the relative proportion of future charges to the allowance 
such a table is merely a convenient device for assessing the adequacy of the allowance as a whole 
the following allocation table has been derived by applying a general allowance to the portfolio as a whole  in addition to specific allowance amounts for internally classified loans 
in retrospect  the specific allocation in any particular category may prove excessive or inadequate and consequently may be reallocated in the future to reflect the then current condition 
accordingly  the entire allowance is available to absorb losses in any category

at december   of the bank s interest bearing liabilities were in the form of time deposits of  and over 
substantially all of such large deposits were obtained from the bank s market area  and none were obtained through brokers 
management believes these deposits to be a stable source of funds

failure to raise such additional capital could adversely impact the growth of the bank or result in its failure to comply with applicable regulatory capital requirements  which could necessitate a reduction in the volume of assets and deposits of the bank 
such reductions could adversely affect the bank s earnings and liquidity

the board of governors of the federal reserve system frb has announced a policy sometimes known as the source of strength doctrine which requires a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks 
the frb has interpreted this requirement to require that a bank holding company  such as the company  stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity 
the frb has stated that it would generally view a failure to assist a troubled or failing subsidiary bank in these circumstances as an unsound or unsafe banking practice or a violation of regulation y or both  justifying a cease and desist order or other enforcement action  particularly if appropriate resources are available to the bank holding company on a reasonable basis 
the requirement that a bank holding company  such as the company  make its assets and resources available to a failing subsidiary bank could have an adverse effect upon the company and its shareholders

year safety and soundness year guidelines on the risks posed to financial institutions by the year problem was issued by the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec 
the guidance underscores that year preparation is not only an information systems issue  according to the ffiec  but also an enterprise wide challenge that must be addressed at the highest level of a financial institution 
the guidance sets out the responsibilities of senior management and boards of directors in managing their year projects 
among the responsibilities of institution managers and directors is that of managing the internal and external risks presented by providers of data processing products and services  business partners  counterparties  major loan customers  correspondent banks  and institutions or entities in which the bank owns securities 
under the guidance  senior management must provide the board of directors with status reports  at least quarterly  on efforts to reach year goals both internally and by the institution s major vendors 
senior management and directors must allocate sufficient resources to ensure that high priority is given to seeing that remediation plans are fulfilled  and that the project receives the quality personnel and timely support it requires

renovation activities such as hardware and software upgrades  system replacements  and vendor certifications are anticipated to be completed by the fourth quarter of current costs and estimated future expenditures do not appear to be material and are expected to have negligible effects on the company s results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
impact of inflation  changing prices and monetary policies the financial statements and related financial data concerning the company in this report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary effect of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates have a more significant effect on the performance of a financial institution than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors which are beyond the control of the bank  including the influence of domestic and foreign economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government and federal agencies  particularly the federal reserve bank 
the federal reserve bank implements national monetary policy such as seeking to curb inflation and combat recession by its open market operations in united states government securities  control of the discount rate applicable to borrowing by banks and establishment of reserve requirements against bank deposits 
the actions of the federal reserve bank in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments and deposits  and affect the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
the nature  timing and impact of any future changes in federal monetary and fiscal policies on the bank and its results of operations are not predictable 
related party transactions in the ordinary course of business  the bank has loans  deposits and other transactions with its executive officers and directors and businesses with which such persons are associated

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company faces market risk to the extent that the fair values of its financial instruments are affected by changes in interest rates 
the asset liability management discipline as applied to the company seeks to limit the volatility  to the extent possible  of both earnings and the fair value of equity that can result from changes in market interest rates 
this is accomplished by limiting the maturities of fixed rate investments  loans and deposits  matching fixed rate assets and liabilities to the extent possible  and optimizing the mix of non interest fee and net interest income 
as can be seen from the table contained in the interest rate sensitivity management section  the company s asset liability mix is asset sensitive under one year with a cumulative gap of  or 
as such  the company is susceptible to changes in interest rates  with a increasing net interest margin and fair value of equity experienced in periods of rising interest rates  correspondingly  a decrease in the net interest margin and fair value of equity in periods of declining interest rates 
the following table presents the company s projected change in fair value of equity for various rate shock levels as of december  after one year 
all market risk sensitive instruments presented in this table are available for sale 
the company has no trading or held to maturity securities 
change in basis points fair value change the preceding table indicates that at december   in the event of a sudden and sustained decrease in prevailing market interest rates  the company s fair value of equity would be expected to decline 
in the event of a sudden and sustained increase in prevailing market interest rates  the company s fair value of equity would be expected to increase 
computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions including relative levels of market interest rates and repricing opportunities of loans which are adjustable and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual expected results 
furthermore  the computations do not contemplate any actions managment could undertake in response to such changes in interest rates 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of fair value of equity 
actual values may differ from the projections presented  should market conditions vary from the assumptions used in the calculation of fair value of equity 
emphasis will continue to be placed on granting loans with short maturities and floating rates where posssible 
this strategy increases liquidity and is necessitated by the continued shortening and more frequent repricing opportuinities of the company s funding sources 
management will continue to monitor the company s interest rate risk position to minimize adverse impact of earnings caused by changes in interest rates
