the company s long range strategic plan emphasizes providing stability for its operations through expanding its product offerings to minimize the impact of individual product cycles on the company s overall performance and by entering into long term strategic alliances 
in pursuing these goals  the company has sought alternatives to its reliance in and on the domestic market for large diameter pipe  the demand for which has declined significantly from levels experienced in those years 
in an effort to decrease the company s reliance on the domestic large diameter pipe market and provide additional end use for its steel plate  the company acquired a percent interest in the camrose pipe mill in june from stelco  a large canadian steel producer  which owns the remaining percent interest in the camrose pipe mill 
in  and  camrose shipped   and  tons  respectively  of steel pipe and generated revenues of million  million  and million  respectively 
during those years stelco was a major supplier of steel plate and coil for the camrose pipe mill 
to expand the company s steel product lines and enter new geographic areas  cf i purchased the pueblo mill and related assets in march in  and the pueblo mill shipped   and  tons  respectively  and generated revenues of million  million and million  respectively 
in august new cf i sold a percent equity interest in new cf i to a subsidiary of nippon

the labor contract at the rmsm division expired on september  after a brief contract extension intended to help facilitate a possible contract  on october  the union initiated a strike at the rmsm division 
see part i business labor dispute 
the rmsm division began to ramp its operations back up in mid october with management and replacement workers 
shipment levels and cost of operations were negatively impacted by reduced production levels and costs specifically related to the strike 
fourth quarter shipments at the rmsm division were  tons with an average selling price of per ton compared to shipments of  tons with an average selling price of per ton in the fourth quarter of the decrease in average selling price for the fourth quarter of is due primarily to a shift in product mix 
the division had reduced production and shipments of rail and seamless pipe as a result of the strike 
in addition  the company sold its wire producing assets in the second quarter of rail  seamless pipe and wire products generally have higher selling prices per ton than other finished products sold by the division 
at the end of december the pueblo mill was operating at percent of capacity and is expected to reach full production during the first half of as a result of successfully resuming operations with a replacement workforce  the company believes it can return to full production with fewer workers than before the strike 
during the fourth quarter of  the oregon steel division shipped  tons with an average selling price of per ton compared to shipments of  tons with an average selling price of per ton during the fourth quarter of shipments for the fourth quarter of were negatively impacted by reduced plate manufactured at the division s portland mill 
the company shut down its old plate rolling mill in september of and shifted all plate production to the combination mill 
the combination mill experienced delays during october and november which significantly reduced the portland mill s production 
the division shut down the combination mill for twelve days in december to make engineering design changes 
the delays and outage resulted in reduced plate volumes and increased production costs during the fourth quarter of the division s percent decrease in average sales price for the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of is primarily due to product mix changes which included a higher percentage of semi finished product and non prime plate products 
the division sold  tons of semi finished product during the fourth quarter of compared to no sales in the fourth quarter of semi finished products have a significantly lower sales price than the division s plate and pipe products 
company sales in the fourth quarter of of million decreased percent from sales of million in the fourth quarter of company shipments decreased percent to  tons in the fourth quarter of from  tons in the fourth quarter of the company s sales and shipments for the nine month period ended september  were million and million tons  respectively  compared to million and million tons  respectively  for the comparable period

shipments increased at the rmsm division due to increased production resulting from the completion of the capital improvement program 
welded pipe shipments increased at the napa pipe mill to  tons in versus  tons in and at the camrose pipe mill to  tons in versus  tons in the higher average selling price in was due to a combination of increased shipments of welded and seamless pipe  higher selling prices for plate and seamless pipe products and reduced shipments of semifinished products  partially offset by increased shipments of rod and bar  which have a generally lower selling price per ton than the other finished products sold by the company 
gross profits
