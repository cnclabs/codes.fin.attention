item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following table sets forth income statement data on an historical and pro forma basis as a percentage of revenue years ended december  pro actual forma revenue operating costs and expenses payroll and related expenses selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization expense total operating costs and expenses income from operations other income expense income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes pro forma net income the company was taxed as an s corporation prior to september  accordingly  pro forma provisions for income taxes and pro forma net income have been provided as if the company had been subject to income taxes in all periods presented 
pro forma compared to actual results of operations pro forma operating data for assume that the acquisitions and the q acquisitions were consummated on january  pro forma adjustments have been made to reflect the elimination of certain expenses that were immediately identifiable at the time of the acquisitions 
for instance  pro forma adjustments to include the elimination of approximately redundant administrative and collection personnel  the reduction of the salaries of the principal shareholders of goodyear and afs  the closing or consolidation of five existing call centers  as well as the downsizing of four call centers into customer service locations 
at the time of the acquisitions  the acquired companies had higher cost structures than that of the company s core business 
the company intends to continue to leverage its infrastructure to realize additional operating efficiencies in order to bring the cost structure of the acquired companies in line with nco s current operating results 
these other costs savings include i further reduction in payroll and related expenses relating primarily to redundant collections and administrative personnel  ii further reductions in facilities costs  and iii reduction of certain expenses such as telephone  mailing and data processing 
management believes it will realize these cost savings with respect to the acquired companies  although no assurances can be given that such cost savings will be realized 
due to the higher cost structures of the acquired business and the fact that all expected expense savings are not reflected in pro forma adjustments  certain pro forma operating percentages compare unfavorably to actual operating percentages for the periods under consideration

for the years and  the company expects to incur total pre tax expenses of approximately  to  per year 
these costs are associated with both internal and external staffing resources for the necessary planning  coordination  remediation  testing  and other expenses to prepare its systems for the year however  a portion of these expenses will not be incremental  but rather represent a redeployment of existing information technology resources 
management does not expect substantial additional license fee costs associated directly with year compliance because the company s software vendors are incorporating necessary modifications as part of their normal system maintenance 
the majority of the costs will be incurred through the modification and testing of electronic data interchange formats with the company s clients 
the cost of planning and initial remediation incurred through has not been significant
