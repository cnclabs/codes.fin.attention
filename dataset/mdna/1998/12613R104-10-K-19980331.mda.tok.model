see outlook and uncertainties below 
seasonality the company believes that advertising sales in traditional media  such as television  are generally lower in the first and third calendar quarters of each year than in the respective preceding quarters and that advertising expenditures fluctuate significantly with economic cycles 
depending on the extent to which the internet is accepted as an advertising medium  seasonality and cyclicality in the level of advertising expenditures generally could become more pronounced for internet advertising 
seasonality and cyclicality in advertising expenditures generally  or with respect to internet based advertising specifically  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or operating results 
the company s quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside the company s control 
factors that may adversely affect the company s quarterly operating results attributable to its internet operations include the level of use of the internet  demand for internet advertising  seasonal trends in both internet use and advertising placements  the addition or loss of advertisers  advertising budgeting cycles of individual advertisers  the level of traffic on the company s internet sites  the amount and timing of capital expenditures and other costs relating to the expansion of the company s internet operations  the introduction of new sites and services by the company or its competitors  price competition or pricing changes in the industry  technical difficulties or system downtime  general economic conditions and economic conditions specific to the internet and internet media 
quarterly operating results attributable to the company s television operations are generally dependent on the costs incurred by the company in producing its television programming 
if the cost of producing television programs for usa networks exceeds the maximum licensing fee payable by usa networks  or if production costs for tv 
com exceed distribution revenues  the company could incur a gross deficit with respect to its television operations 
further  the size and demographic characteristics of the company s television viewing audience may be adversely affected by the popularity of competing television programs  including special events  the time slots chosen for the company s programs by the cable network carrying such programs and the popularity of programs immediately preceding the company s programs 
as a result of the company s strategy to cross market its television and internet operations  the company believes that any decrease in the number of viewers of its television programs will have a negative effect on the usage of its internet sites 
accordingly  a decrease in viewership of the company s television programs could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or operating results 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is likely that the company s operating results may fall below the expectations of the company  securities analysts or investors in some future quarter 
in such event  the trading price of the company s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
year compliance in the next two years  most companies could face a potentially serious information systems problem because many software applications and operational programs written in the past were designed to handle date formats with two digit years and thus may not properly recognize calendar dates beginning in the year this problem could result in computers either outputting incorrect data or shutting down altogether when attempting to process a date such as the company has examined all of its critical software and operational applications and in the opinion of management  there should be no significant conversion issues related to the year issue 
in addition  however  the company could be exposed to a potential adverse impact resulting from the failure of financial institutions and other third parties to adequately address the year problem 
the company intends to devote the necessary resources to identify and resolve year issues that may exist with third parties 
however  the company cannot estimate the cost of this effort at this time  nor can any assurance be given that the year problem will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
outlook and uncertainties the company s future financial condition and results are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties  some of which are summarized in this section 
limited operating history  accumulated deficit  anticipated losses 
the company was founded in december and first recognized revenues from its television operations in april and from its internet operations in october accordingly  the company has an extremely limited operating history upon which an evaluation of the company and its prospects can be based 
see introduction to item  management s discussion and analysis 
since inception  the company has incurred significant losses and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
the company expects to continue to incur significant losses on a quarterly and annual basis in the future 
if currently available cash and cash generated by operations is insufficient to satisfy the company s liquidity requirements  the company may be required to sell additional equity or debt securities 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would result in additional dilution to the company s stockholders 
there can be no assurance that financing will be available to the company in amounts or on terms acceptable to the company 
see item  management s discussion and analysis liquidity and capital resources 
potential fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
the company s quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside the company s control  including  the level of use of the internet  demand for internet advertising  seasonal trends in both internet use and advertising placements  the addition or loss of advertisers  advertising budgeting cycles of individual advertisers  the level of traffic on the company s internet sites  the amount and timing of capital expenditures and other costs relating to the expansion of the company s internet operations  the introduction of new sites and services by the company or its competitors  price competition or pricing changes in the industry  technical difficulties or system downtime  general economic conditions and economic conditions specific to the internet and internet media 
due to the foregoing factors  among others  it is likely that the company s operating results may fall below the expectations of the company  securities analysts or investors in some future quarter 
in such event  the trading price of the company s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
see item  management s discussion and analysis seasonality 
dependence on advertising revenues  customer concentration 
a substantial percentage of the company s revenues are derived from the sale of advertising on its internet sites and television programs 
most of the company s advertising contracts can be terminated by the customer at any time on very short notice 
furthermore  most of the company s revenues have been derived from a limited number of advertising customers 
if the company loses advertising customers  fails to attract new customers or is forced to reduce advertising rates in order to retain or attract customers  the company s business  financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected 
see item  business sales and marketing and note of notes to financial statements 
uncertain acceptance of the internet as an advertising medium 
use of the internet by consumers is at a very early stage of development  and market acceptance of the internet as a medium for information  entertainment  commerce and advertising is subject to a high level of uncertainty 
if internet based advertising is not widely accepted by advertisers and advertising agencies  the company s business  financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected 
see item  business sales and marketing 
uncertain acceptance of the company s internet content 
the company s future success depends upon its ability to deliver original and compelling internet content and services in order to attract users with demographic characteristics valuable to the company s advertising customers 
there can be no assurance that the company s content and services will be attractive to a sufficient number of internet users to generate advertising revenues 
see item  business strategy 
uncertain acceptance of the company stelevision programming 
the company s television programming is critical to its overall business strategy  and the company expects to rely to a significant extent on its television programming to promote the cnet and snap brands and to attract users to its internet sites 
to achieve these objectives  the company must develop original and compelling television programming and obtain distribution for such programming 
the successful development  production and distribution of television programming is subject to numerous uncertainties  and there can be no assurance that the company s television programming will be accepted by television broadcasters  cable networks or their viewers 
see item  business television 
competition 
the market for internet content and services is new  intensely competitive and rapidly evolving  there are minimal barriers to entry  and current and new competitors can launch new sites at relatively low cost 
there can be no assurance that the company will compete successfully with current or future competitors 
see item  business competition 
uncertain acceptance and maintenance of brands 
the company believes that establishing and maintaining the cnet and snap brands is a critical aspect of its efforts to attract and expand its internet and television audience and that the importance of brand recognition will increase due to the growing number of internet sites and the relatively low barriers to entry in providing internet content and services 
if the company is unable to provide high quality content and services or otherwise fails to promote and maintain its brands  or if the company incurs excessive expenses in an attempt to improve its content and services or promote and maintain its brands  the company s business  financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected 
see item  business sales and marketing 
managing potential growth 
the company has rapidly and significantly expanded its operations  including the substantial recent expansion represented by snap 
this rapid growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on the company s management  operational and financial resources 
if the company is unable to manage growth effectively  the company s business  financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected 
see item  business sites and services and item  business employees 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s performance is substantially dependent on the continued services of halsey m 
minor  shelby w 
bonnie  and the other members of its senior management team  as well as on the company s ability to retain and motivate its other officers and key employees 
the company s future success also depends on its continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel 
the inability to attract and retain the necessary technical  managerial  editorial and sales personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or operating results 
see item  business employees 
risks of television distribution  dependence on usa networks 
the company s television programming is currently carried primarily on the usa network and the sci fi channel  both of which are owned by usa networks  pursuant to an agreement between the company and usa networks  which expires on june  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain distribution for its television programming after june  see item  business television agreement with usa networks 
dependence on third parties for internet operations 
the company relies on the cooperation of owners and operators of other internet sites and on its relationships with third party vendors of internet development tools and technologies 
the company s ability to advertise on other internet sites and the willingness of the owners of such sites to direct users to the company s internet sites through hypertext links are also critical to the success of the company s internet operations 
there can be no assurance that the necessary cooperation from third parties will be available on acceptable commercial terms or at all 
if the company is unable to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with such third parties on acceptable commercial terms  or if the company s competitors are better able to leverage such relationships  the company s business  financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected 
see item  business internet sites and services 
risks of technological change 
the market for internet products and services is characterized by rapid technological developments  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards 
the emerging character of these products and services and their rapid evolution will require that the company continually improve the performance  features and reliability of its internet content  particularly in response to competitive offerings 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in responding quickly  cost effectively and sufficiently to these developments 
see item  business technology 
dependence on continued growth in use of the internet 
rapid growth in the use of and interest in the internet is a recent phenomenon  and there can be no assurance that acceptance and use of the internet will continue to develop or that a sufficient base of users will emerge to support the company s business 
if use of the internet does not continue to grow or grows more slowly than expected  or if the internet infrastructure does not effectively support growth that may occur  the company s business  financial condition and operating results would be materially adversely affected 
see item  business internet sites and services 
capacity constraints and system disruptions 
the satisfactory performance  reliability and availability of the company s internet sites and its network infrastructure are critical to attracting internet users and maintaining relationships with advertising customers 
system interruptions that result in the unavailability of the company s internet sites or slower response times for users would reduce the number of advertisements delivered and reduce the attractiveness of the company s internet sites to users and advertisers 
see item  business technology 
the company s internet and television operations are also vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure and other events beyond the company s control 
all of the company s servers and television production equipment is currently located in san francisco  california  an area that is susceptible to earthquakes

see item  business intellectual property 
the company s operations  particularly its internet directories and search  which facilitate access to third party content  could also be subject to a range of existing and proposed laws concerning the distribution of obscene or indecent material over the internet 
see item  business government regulation 
risks associated with potential acquisitions and investiments 
the company s current strategy is to broaden the number  scope and content of its internet sites through the acquisition of existing sites and businesses specializing in internet related technologies and content  as well as through internally developed internet sites and services 
any such investments would involve many of the same risks posed by acquisitions  particularly risks related to the diversion of resources  the inability to generate revenues  the impairment of relationships with third parties and potential additional expenses 
there can be no assurance that the company would be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with such acquisitions or new investments 
see item business business strategy and item  business employees 
security

the company may be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against the threat of such security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches 
see item  business technology 
dependence on intellectual property rights  risks of infringement 
the company relies on trade secret and copyright laws to protect its proprietary technologies  but there can be no assurance that such laws will provide sufficient protection to the company  that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to the company s  or that third parties will not copy or otherwise obtain and use the company s technologies without authorization

governemt regulation and legal uncertainty 
although there are currently few laws and regulations directly applicable to the internet  it is possible that new laws and regulations will be adopted covering issues such as privacy  copyrights  obscene or indecent communications and the pricing  characteristics and quality of internet products and services 
the adoption of restrictive laws or regulations could decrease the growth of the internet or expose the company to significant liabilities
