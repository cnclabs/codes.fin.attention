forward looking statement the company intends to continue making significant expenditures on research and development to develop new products and expand the platforms and operating systems on which its products are offered 
while the company believes that these current research and development expenditures will be beneficial in the long term development of its business  there can be no assurances that the development of products will be successful or will not be rendered obsolete by future technology acquisitions or development

the company s operating expenses are based in part on its expectations of future revenues  and expenses are generally incurred in advance of revenues 
the company plans to continue to expand and increase its operating expenses to support anticipated revenue growth 
if revenues do not materialize in a quarter as expected  the company s results from operations for that quarter are likely to be materially adversely affected 
results of operations may be disproportionately affected by a reduction in revenues because only a small portion of the company s expenses varies with its revenues 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operating results to date 
factors that may affect future results the company operates in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties 
the following section lists some  but not all  of those risks and uncertainties which may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
this section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this annual report on form k 
the company has identified certain forward looking statements in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations with a footnote symbol 
the company may also make oral forward looking statements from time to time 
actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those set forth below and elsewhere in this form k 
the market for software products is generally characterized by rapidly changing technology  frequent new product introductions and changes in customer requirements  which can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable 
the company believes that a major factor in its future success will be its ability to continue to develop and introduce in a timely and cost effective manner enhancements to its existing products and new products that will gain market acceptance 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify  develop  manufacture  market or support new products or enhancements successfully  that any such new products or enhancements will gain market acceptance  or that the company will be able to respond effectively to technological changes 
there can be no assurance that the company will not encounter technical or other difficulties that could delay introduction of new products in the future 
if the company is unable to introduce new products or enhancements and respond to industry changes on a timely basis  its business could be materially adversely affected 
the market for the automated software testing products is relatively new and undeveloped 
marketing and sales techniques in the automated software testing marketplace  as well as the basis for competition  are not well established 
there can be no assurance that a significant market for automated software testing products will be developed or that the company s products will be accepted in any expanded market 
although the company believes that the current trend toward increased use of automated software testing will continue  a majority of software testing is still carried out manually  and there can be no assurance that the automated software market will enjoy continued growth 
the company s current products and products under development are limited in number and concentrated exclusively in the software testing market 
the life cycles of the company s products are difficult to estimate due  in large measure  to the recent emergence of the company s market as well as the unknown future effect of product enhancements and competition 
price reductions or declines in demand for the company s software testing products  whether as a result of competition  technological change or otherwise  would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
the company may from time to time experience significant fluctuation in quarterly operating results due to a variety of factors 
such fluctuations in quarterly operating results may occur in the future due to many factors  some of which are outside of the company s control 
products are generally shipped as orders are received  and  forward looking statement consequently  quarterly sales and operating results depend primarily on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
in particular  the company has historically received a substantial portion of its orders at the end of a quarter  up to the last few days of a quarter 
if an unanticipated order shortfall occurs at the end of a quarter  the company s operating results for the quarter could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  product orders are affected by the buying patterns of customers 
the buying trends of customers are further impacted by internal budgetary considerations relating to year remediation efforts 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses are relatively fixed  and planned expenditures are based on sales forecasts 
all of the foregoing may result in unanticipated quarterly earning shortfalls or losses 
accordingly  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
the market for software products  in general  is highly competitive 
the company continues to face direct competition from established and emerging companies  both publicly and privately held 
in the past year  a number of the company s competitors have been consolidated through acquisitions and may have significantly greater resources than the company 
there could be a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial position if any of the major software manufacturers  which have significantly greater resources than the company  decided to devote substantial resources to entering the software testing market or if there is an increase in developing testing utilities internally by the company s customers or potential customers 
a variety of external and internal factors could materially adversely affect the company s ability to compete 
these include the relative functionality  price  performance and reliability of the products offered by the company and its competitors  the timing and success of new product development or enhancement efforts of the company and its competitors  and the effectiveness of the marketing efforts of the company and its competitors 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future or that competitive pressures will not materially adversely affect the company s business 
sales to customers located outside the united states have historically accounted for a significant percentage of revenue and the company anticipates that such sales will continue to be a significant percentage of the company s total revenue 
accordingly  such factors as currency fluctuations  political and economic instability and trade restrictions could have a negative impact on the company s financial performance 
certain of the company s sales are made in currencies other than the us dollar and its financial results are reported in us dollars 
fluctuations in the rates of exchange between the us dollar and other currencies may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial position 
to date  the company has not hedged to any significant extent against currency translation risks 
as part of its growth strategy  the company may  from time to time  acquire or invest in complementary businesses  products or technologies 
while there are currently no commitments with respect to any particular acquisition or investment  the company s management frequently evaluates the strategic opportunity available related to complimentary businesses  products or technologies 
the process of integrating an acquired company s business into the company s operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of the company s business 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or investment will be realized 
future acquisitions or investments by the company could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  any of which could materially adversely affect the company s operating results and financial condition 
during the year ended december   the company acquired certain technologies which will be integrated into its next version of load testing products 
as a result of this purchase  the company s results of operations for the year ended december  included a write off of in process research and development expense and related charges of million 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its efforts to integrate the acquired technologies or will not incur additional charges in subsequent quarters to forward looking statement reflect costs associated with the acquisition 
although the company believes the acquisition of technology described above is in the best interest of the company and its stockholders  there are significant risks involved with this transaction  including  but not limited to  difficulties or delays in achieving product and technology integration benefits and difficulties in maintaining revenue levels during the transition to new products 
since its inception  the company has obtained royalty bearing grants from various israeli government agencies  and the company expects to receive additional grants in the future 
forward looking statement any such grants will likely decline as a percentage of gross research and development spending and there can be no assurance that the company will receive any such grants 
termination or substantial reduction of such grants or changes in revenue classification could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the terms of certain grants prohibit the manufacture of products developed under these grants outside of israel and the transfer of technology developed pursuant to the terms of these grants to any person  without the prior written consent of the government of israel 
as a result  if the company is unable to obtain the consent of the government of israel  the company may not be able to take advantage of strategic manufacturing and other opportunities outside of israel 
since  the company has experienced significant annual increases in revenue 
this growth has placed  and if it continues will place  a significant strain on the company s management  resources and operations 
to accommodate its recent growth  the company is implementing a variety of new or expanded business and financial systems  procedures and controls  including the improvement of its accounting and other internal management systems 
there can be no assurance that the implementation of such systems  procedures and controls can be completed successfully  or without disruption of the company s operations 
if the company s growth continues  the company will be required to hire and integrate substantial numbers of new employees 
the market has become increasingly competitive both in the united states and israel and may require the company to pay higher salaries 
the company s failure to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
the company s success depends to a significant extent on the performance of its senior management and certain key employees 
competition for highly skilled employees  including sales  technical and management personnel  is intense in the computer industry 
the company s failure to attract additional qualified employees or to retain the services of key personnel could materially adversely affect the company s business 
the company currently relies on a combination of trademark  copyright and trade secret laws and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights in its products 
the company presently has no registered copyrights 
the company holds three patents for elements contained in certain of its products  and it has filed several other us and foreign patent applications on various elements of its products 
there can be no assurance that any of the company s patent applications will result in an issued patent or that  if issued  such patent would be upheld if challenged 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company s technology 
there can also be no assurance that the measures taken by the company to protect its propriety rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of the technology or independent development by others of similar technology 
in addition  the laws of various countries in which the company s products may be sold may not protect the company s products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert intellectual property infringement claims against the company or that any such claims will not require the company to enter into royalty or cross license arrangements or result in costly litigation 
in selling its products  the company frequently relies on shrink wrap licenses that are not signed by licensees 
the provisions in such licenses limiting the company s exposure to potential product liability claims may therefore be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
although  the company carries errors and omissions insurance against such claims  there can be no assurance that such insurance will continue to be available on acceptable terms  if at all  or that such insurance will provide the company with adequate protection forward looking statement against any such claims 
although the company has not experienced any product liability claims to date  the sale and support of products by the company may entail the risk of such claims 
a significant product liability claim against the company could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s stock price  has been and will continue to be  subject to significant volatility 
past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
if revenues or earnings in any quarter fail to meet expectations of the investment community  there could be an immediate and significant impact on the company s stock price 
in addition  the company s stock price may be affected by broader market trends that may be unrelated to the company s performance 
the approach of year presents significant issues for many computer systems  since much of the software in use today may not accurately process data beyond the company has recently implemented new information systems and accordingly does not anticipate any internal year issues from its own information systems  databases or programs 
however  the company could be adversely impacted by year issues faced by major distributors  suppliers  customers  vendors and financial service organizations with which the company interacts 
the company is currently taking steps to address the impact  if any  of the year issue on the operations of the company 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to detect all potential failures of the company s and or third parties computer systems 
a significant failure of the company s or a third party s computer system could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and result of operations 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of those assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the recorded amounts of expenses during the reporting period 
a change in the facts and circumstances surrounding these estimates could result in a change to the estimates and impact future operating results 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company s principle source of liquidity consisted of million of cash and investments as compared with million and million at december  and  respectively 
the december  balance included million short term and million long term investments in high quality government and corporate securities 
during  the company generated million net cash from operating activities  compared with cash used for operating activities of million in and net cash provided by operating activities of million in the increase in was primarily due to an increase in net income  excluding the write off of in process research and development and an increase in deferred revenue  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
the decrease in compared with was due primarily to payment of litigation  acquisition and restructuring costs accrued during the company s primary investing activities were purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of software development costs  which totaled to million  million and million in  and  respectively 
purchases of property and equipment in included million for the company s new headquarters building in sunnyvale  california  and million to begin construction of a new facility in israel 
during the first quarter of  the company spent approximately million to complete renovation of the building 
the company expects to spend an additional million to complete construction of the israel facility and will relocate its israel subsidiary in the company s primary financing activity consisted of issuances of common stock under the employee stock option and stock purchase plans and  in  completion of the company s secondary public offering of forward looking statement common stock 
proceeds from issuance of stock under the employee stock option and purchase plans amounted to million  million and million in  and respectively 
net proceeds from the secondary public offering of common stock amounted to million 
assuming there is no significant change in the company s business  the company believes that its current cash and investment balances and cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to fund the company s cash needs for at least the next twelve months
