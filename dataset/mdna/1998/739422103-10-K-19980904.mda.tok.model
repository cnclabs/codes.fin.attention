year compliance certain computer hardware and software use two digit data fields to store and recognize years  assuming the first two digits of the year are eg  the number is recognized as 
this and certain similar protocols give rise to possible problems related to the recognition of dates in years after so called year issues 
the company continues to assess and address the business risks associated with year issues 
some of the company s systems include hardware and packaged software recently purchased from vendors who have represented that these systems are year compliant 
other hardware and software used by the company has been identified by the company as not being year compliant 
the company expects that year upgrades to the software used in its manufacturing systems and replacement components for certain older hardware used in these systems will soon be available from vendors 
the cost of these upgrades and replacements is not expected to be material 
the company relies on a number of vendors and suppliers  including banks  telecommunication providers  and other providers of goods and services 
the inability of these third parties to conduct their business for a significant period of time due to the year issue could have a material adverse impact on the company s operations 
the company has not determined whether all of its vendors and suppliers are year compliant 
the company s reliance on single vendor source suppliers  however  is minimal  and the company seeks to limit sole source supply relationships 
the company is continuing to assess potential year issues and is developing contingency plans 
at this time  the company believes costs incurred in responding to other parties year computer system deficiencies  together with the cost of any required modifications to the company s systems  will not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
this analysis may be modified as the company s assessment of potential year issues progresses
