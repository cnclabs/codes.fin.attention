the company believes that these sources of cash are sufficient to finance its working capital requirements and other needs 
in december the board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program to purchase up to million shares of class a common stock 
as of october    shares were repurchased under this program 
the company s bank borrowings are made pursuant to a revolving credit agreement the agreement which provides a revolving credit line and letter of credit line of up to  through march interest is payable monthly and at various rates of either prime plus or libor plus 
the company believes that it will be able either to extend the agreement beyond march or negotiate a replacement facility  but there can be no assurance of such extension or replacement facility

these non recourse borrowings have been generally secured by mortgage loans originated by one of the company s subsidiaries 
as of october   the aggregate outstanding principal amount of such borrowings was  the book value of the company s inventories  rental condominiums  and commercial properties completed and under development amounted to the following october  october  residential real estate inventory   residential rental property   total residential real estate   commercial properties   combined total   total residential real estate increased  from october  to october  as a result of an inventory increase of  which was partially offset by the reallocation of land and approval costs to commercial properties see below  the writedown of certain communities under development or land held for sale  and the write off of optioned parcels of land and related approval  engineering and capitalized interests costs 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note the increase in residential real estate inventory was primarily due to the company s efforts to increase deliveries in its first quarter requiring higher inventory levels which were offset somewhat by the company reducing inventories in the florida market where competition has reduced its sales volume 
residential homes under construction or completed and included in residential real estate inventory at october  are expected to be closed during the next twelve months 
most residential real estate completed or under development is financed through the company s line of credit and subordinated indebtedness

the company plans to sell its investment properties except for the two senior citizen rental communities which after the elimination of debt will net approximately million to be redeployed in its residential homebuilding business 
management believes redeployment of this capital will enhance future profitability of the company 
in accordance with fas  the company reevaluated such properties as held for sale 
since certain investment properties carrying amounts exceeded the fair value less selling costs  an impairment loss was recorded against the related asset 
these writedowns were on new jersey and florida properties 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note in new jersey the company also wrote off the costs related to an option and related approval  engineering and capitalized interest costs 
the writedowns and write offs of investment properties amounted to  the writedowns and write offs were partially offset by the reallocation of land and approval costs on a multi use parcel of land 
as a result of the reallocation   was added to investment properties held for sale from homebuilding land held for future development

housing revenues    homes delivered california housing revenues    homes delivered poland and other housing revenues   homes delivered totals housing revenues    homes delivered    the overall decrease in housing revenues is a combination of fewer deliveries offset somewhat by increases in average sales prices 
the decrease in the number of homes delivered during the year ended october  is primarily due to the decreased deliveries in the northeast region and florida 
the decrease in the northeast was due to the timing of deliveries and the company s desire to even out deliveries over the four quarters of fiscal in florida  deliveries declined since the company cut back its operations due to a highly competitive market 
the increased average sales prices are primarily the result of diversifying the company s product mix in the northeast region to include more detached single family homes and larger townhouses with garages designed for the move up buyer 
in florida  average sales prices increased as a result of fewer communities  all of which are higher priced single family developments 
in north carolina  average sales prices increased primarily due to the addition of higher priced communities 
in metro washington  dc average sales prices decreased because there was a lower percentage of single family detached homes delivered 
in california sales prices decreased due to a change in product mix to smaller less expensive homes

see notes to consolidated financial statements note for additional explanation 
these writedowns and writeoffs were incurred primarily because of lower property values due to economic downturns  a change in the marketing strategy to liquidate a particular property  or the decision not to exercise an option 
during the year ended october  the company has written down certain residential communities  and written off certain residential land options including approval  engineering and capitalized interest costs 
in florida the company s return on investment has been unsatisfactory 
as a result  the company established a goal to reduce its investment in florida by million 
to do so on an accelerated basis  it reduced prices and offered pricing concessions in all florida residential communities 
the company also decided to sell all inactive properties in florida 
in the northeast region the company changed the product type to be constructed on a parcel of land it owns 
in an active community in the northeast region the company incurred unforeseen development costs 
also in the northeast the company decided to sell an optioned property instead of developing it 
the result of the above decisions was a reduction in fair values below carrying amounts and  in accordance with fas  the company recorded an impairment loss on the related inventories 
at october  residential inventories were reduced million to reduce such inventories to estimated fair value 
the northeast region also wrote off costs associated with three option properties and related approval  engineering and capitalized interest costs amounting to million 
in two cases  the company decided not to exercise the option due to environmental problems 
the third option was not exercised because the community s proforma profitability did not produce an adequate return on investment commensurate with the risk 
the writedowns of residential inventories during the years ended october  and october  were primarily attributable to one community in new york  two in new jersey  a parcel of land in florida  and four communities in metro washington  dc in the new york community  the writedown is an addition to and prior years reserves due to reduced sales prices  buyers concessions  and an extended sellout period 
in new jersey the and writedowns were due to the change in use of a parcel of land from residential to commercial and due to the termination of home sales in a community and the offering of the remaining owned lots for sale  respectively 
in florida a parcel of idle land was written down in due to a decline in land values 
in metro washington  dc the writedown was primarily due to reduced sales prices in one community 
the writedown was also due to the termination of home sales in two communities and the offering of the remaining owned lots for sale 
also in metro washington  dc a reserve was taken in against a parcel of land which the company is attempting to liquidate through lot sales and increased in due to continued decline in lot values 
at october  and residential inventories were reduced million and million  respectively  to reduce such inventories to estimated fair value

as a result  depending on the mix of both communities and of home types delivered  consolidated gross margin will fluctuate up or down 
during the year ended october  gross margins decreased in all the company s markets compared to the same period last year 
this decline was primarily caused by higher housing  land and development costs and commission expenses 
of the increase was the result of unforeseen development costs in one community in the northeast region 
the balance of the increase in housing  land and development costs was due to a higher number of communities not obtaining acceptable housing  land and development cost performance 
the increase in commissions was the result of more co broker sales and sales associate incentives to increase sales 
during the year ended october  gross margins improved in all the company s markets except metro washington  dc compared to the year ended october  these increases were offset by a change in geographic and product mix with an additional of home deliveries coming from outside the northeast region where gross margins are traditionally lower 
selling and general administrative expenses increased million and million for the years ended october  and  respectively 
as a percentage of homebuilding revenues such expenses increased to for the year ended october  from for the year ended october  which had decreased from for the prior year

in addition  its goals included reducing expenses by reducing mortgage processing time 
the processing time from application to issuance of approval was reduced to an average of under days 
as a result of increased capture rates of company homebuyers  the company expects to be profitable in fiscal and beyond 
most servicing rights on new mortgages originated by the company will be sold as the loans are closed 
investment properties investment properties consist of rental properties  property management  and gains or losses from sale of such property 
see capital resources and liquidity for information on the company s decision to sell its investment properties

see notes to consolidated financial statements note for an additional explanation of taxes 
inflation inflation has a long term effect on the company because increasing costs of land  materials and labor result in increasing sales prices of its homes 
in general  these price increases have been commensurate with the general rate of inflation in the company s housing markets and have not had a significant adverse effect on the sale of the company s homes 
a significant inflationary risk faced by the housing industry generally is that rising housing costs  including land and interest costs  will substantially outpace increases in the income of potential purchasers 
in recent years  in the price ranges in which it sells homes  the company has not found this risk to be a significant problem 
inflation has a lesser short term effect on the company because the company generally negotiates fixed price contracts with its subcontractors and material suppliers for the construction of its homes 
these prices usually are applicable for a specified number of residential buildings or for a time period of between four to twelve months 
construction costs for residential buildings represent approximately of the company s total costs and expenses
