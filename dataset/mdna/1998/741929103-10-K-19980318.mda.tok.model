the company has financed its growth to date through an august senior notes and warrants offering  the november initial public offering and other private placements of its common stock  and capital lease financing 
the semi annual interest payments due under the senior notes are pre funded by the restricted investments for payments through august  the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents  restricted investments  and capital lease and other financing subject to the limitations contained in the senior notes indenture will be sufficient to fund the company s operating losses  debt service requirements  capital expenditures including the expansion of the primus network as currently contemplated  and other working capital requirements for the combined operations for the foreseeable future 
as a result of the trescom acquisition  the company may further expand its network  particularly as countries in the caribbean and central and south america experience deregulation 
such expansion may include additions to the existing trescom network as well as additions to the primus network 
the company is currently analyzing the extent of such potential network additions  and the sources of any related financing 
the company s level of indebtedness is substantial  and the company must increase its net cash flow in order to meet long term debt service obligations

year compliance in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff legal bulletin no 
 dated october   the company has begun a review and assessment of the anticipated costs  problems and uncertainties associated with year issues 
the company is implementing a year compliance plan whereby each operating unit is responsible for identifying systems requiring modification or conversion both internal systems and those provided by or otherwise available from outside vendors

special note regarding forward looking statements statements in this annual report on form k  including those concerning the company s expectations of future sales  net revenue  gross profit  net income  network development  traffic development  capital expenditures  selling  general and administrative expenses  service introductions and cash requirements  include certain forward looking statements 
as such  actual results may vary materially from such expectations 
factors which could cause results to differ from expectations include risks associated with limited operating history  entry into developing markets 
the company was founded in february  began generating revenue in march and acquired its operating subsidiary  axicorp  in march the company intends to enter markets where it has limited or no operating experience 
the company s prospects should be considered in light of risks  expenses  problems and delays inherent in establishing a new business in a rapidly changing industry 
managing rapid growth 
the company s strategy of rapid growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on the company 
in order to manage its growth effectively  the company must continue to implement and improve its operational and financial systems and controls  purchase and utilize additional transmission facilities  and expand  train and manage its employees  all within a rapidly changing regulatory environment 
inaccuracies in the company s forecast of traffic could result in insufficient or excessive transmission facilities and disproportionate fixed expenses 
substantial indebtedness  liquidity 
the company currently has substantial indebtedness and anticipates that it and its subsidiaries will incur additional indebtedness in the future 
the level of the company s indebtedness i could make it more difficult for it to make payments of interest on its outstanding debt  ii could limit the ability of the company to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes  iii requires that a substantial portion of the company s cash flow from operations  if any  be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness and other obligations and  accordingly  will not be available for use in its business  iv could limit its flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in its business  v results in the company being more highly leveraged than some of its competitors  which may place it at a competitive disadvantage  and vi will make it more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in its business 
historical and future operating losses  negative ebitda  net losses 
since inception  primus had negative cash flow from operating activities and negative ebitda 
in addition  primus incurred net losses in   and  and has an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of december  the company expects to continue to incur additional operating losses  negative ebitda and negative cash flow from operations as it expands its operations and continues to build out and upgrade its network 
there can be no assurance that the company s revenue will grow or be sustained in future periods or that it will be able to achieve or sustain its profitability or positive cash flow from operations in any future period 
acquisition risks 
acquisitions  a key element in the company s growth strategy  involve operational risks  including the possibility that an acquisition does not ultimately provide the benefits originally anticipated by management  while the company continues to incur operating expenses to provide the services formerly provided by the acquired company  and financial risks including the incurrence of indebtedness by the company in order to effect the acquisition subject to the limitations contained in the indenture and the consequent need to service that indebtedness 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in identifying attractive acquisition candidates  completing and financing additional acquisitions on favorable terms  or integrating the acquired business or assets into its own 
intense competition 
the long distance telecommunications industry is intensely competitive and is significantly influenced by the marketing and pricing decisions of the larger industry participants 
competition in all of the company s markets is likely to increase and  as deregulatory influences are experienced in markets outside the united states  competition in non united states markets is likely to become similar to the intense competition in the united states 
many of the company s competitors are significantly larger  have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources and larger networks than the company  a broader portfolio of service offerings  greater control over transmission lines  stronger name recognition and customer loyalty  as well as long standing relationships with the company s target customers 
in addition  many of the company s competitors enjoy economies of scale that result in a lower cost structure for transmission and related costs which could cause significant pricing pressures within the industry 
dependence on transmission facilities based carriers 
the company s ability to maintain and expand its business is dependent upon whether the company continues to maintain favorable relationships with the transmission facilities based carriers to carry the company s traffic 
international operations 
in many international markets  the existing carrier will control access to the local networks  enjoy better brand recognition and brand and customer loyalty  and have significant operational economies  including a larger backbone network and correspondent agreements 
moreover  the existing carrier may take many months to allow competitors  including the company  to interconnect to its switches within its territory 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain the permits and operating licenses required for it to operate  obtain access to local transmission facilities or to market services in international markets 
in addition  operating in international markets generally involves additional risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs  customs  duties and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  problems in collecting accounts receivable  political risks  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  foreign exchange controls which restrict repatriation of funds  technology export and import restrictions  seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
dependence on effective information systems 
the company s management information systems must grow as the company s business expands and are expected to change as new technological developments occur 
there can be no assurance that the company will not encounter delays or cost overruns or suffer adverse consequences in implementing new systems when required 
any of the company s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year and are vulnerable to the year problem which could result in a major system failure or miscalculations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully implement upgrades to its systems to correct any year problem 
a failure of the company s computer systems  or the failure of the company s vendors or customers to effectively upgrade their software and systems for transition to the year  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial condition or results of operations 
industry changes 
the international telecommunications industry is changing rapidly due to deregulation  privatization  technological improvements  expansion of infrastructure and the globalization of the world s economies 
in order to compete effectively  the company must adjust its contemplated plan of development to meet changing market conditions 
the telecommunications industry is marked by the introduction of new product and service offerings and technological improvements 
the company s profitability will depend on its ability to anticipate  assess and adapt to rapid technological changes and its ability to offer  on a timely and cost effective basis  services that meet evolving industry standards 
network development  migration of traffic 
the long term success of the company is dependent upon its ability to design  implement  operate  manage and maintain the network 
the company could experience delays or cost overruns in the implementation of the network  or its ability to migrate traffic onto its network  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
dependence on key personnel 
the loss of the services of k 
paul singh  the company s chairman and chief executive officer  or the services of its other key personnel  or the inability of the company to attract and retain additional key management  technical and sales personnel for which competition is intense in the telecommunications industry  could have a material adverse effect upon the company 
government regulation 
the company s operations are subject to constantly changing regulation 
there can be no assurance that future regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on the company  or that regulators or third parties will not raise material issues with regard to the company s compliance or non compliance with applicable regulations  any of which could have a material adverse effect upon the company
