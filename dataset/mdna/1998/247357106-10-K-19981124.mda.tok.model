item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview increased sales of the company s transgenic cotton varieties containing both the bollgard and roundup ready gene technologies  and the increased commercial sales of d pl cotton varieties containing the roundup ready gene technology are the major reasons that d pl reported record sales despite the fact that acreage planted in cotton with the us declined to million acres from levels of million acres 
commodity prices and the cold wet weather in some areas and drought conditions in other areas during the cotton planting season contributed to the reduction in cotton acreage planted to levels well below initial usda and company estimates 
furthermore  a substantial number of acres were abandoned for which no technology fees were assessed 
the company sold sufficient quantities of seed containing the transgenic traits to plant approximately million acres in versus approximately million acres in first year sales by d pl s china joint venture  although impressive  fell below best case estimates of up to  acres when only  were actually planted 
even so  the joint venture may report a slight profit in its first full year of operation 
export sales increased to million in from million in in  the company recorded special and nonrecurring pretax charges of  that relate to additional inventory reserves and  to a lesser degree  to costs related to the evaluation of various strategic alternatives which culminated in the company entering into a merger agreement with monsanto 
the unprecedented level of inventory reserves and write offs were a result of excess inventory quantities resulting from a reduction in acreage and the further realignment of the company s product line 
furthermore  the company s domestic market share declined slightly which the company believes resulted from the second quarter recall of certain varieties that contained both the bollgard and roundup ready technology 
the accelerated shift to transgenic products significantly complicates inventory management and product line design and will require continued dedicated efforts to effectively manage the company s ever changing product line 
the costs related to the merger are primarily fees for legal advice  investment bankers and other professionals 
in  d pl announced a program to optimize production and cost operating efficiencies which included the idling of three of its less efficient delinting plants  the write down of assets whose value has been impaired as a result of implementing the plan  plant consolidation costs relating to implementation of a new process manufacturing system and costs to phase out certain products 
the company reduced its existing domestic work force as a result of the plant closings and by offering an early retirement program to all employees who met certain uniformed criteria 
d m international  llc  is a venture formed in through which d pl the managing member and monsanto plan to introduce  in combination  cottonseed in international markets combining d pl s acid delinting technology and elite germplasm and monsanto s bollgard gene technology 
in november  d m international  llc formed a subsidiary  d pl china pte ltd 
d pl china 
in november  d pl china concluded negotiations with parties in hebei province  one of the major cotton producing regions in the people s republic of china  to form hebei ji dai cottonseed technology company ltd 
ji dai  a joint venture controlled by d pl china 
in june  ji dai commenced construction of a new cottonseed conditioning and storage facility in hebei  china  under terms of the joint venture agreement 
the new facility was completed in december during the growing season  the joint venture harvested and produced sufficient seed to plant up to  acres of deltapine cottonseed varieties containing bollgard gene 
in  the joint venture had initial sales of enough seed to plant up to  acres 
the copmany anticipates that the carry over inventory will be sold in the and subsequent seasons 
in december  d m international  llc  announced a joint venture with centro integral agropecuaria ciagro  a distributor of agricultural inputs in the argentine cotton region  for the production and sale of genetically improved cottonseed 
the new joint venture  cdm mandiyu  is owned by d m international  llc  and by ciagro 
the cotton region  comprised of the provinces of chaco  santiago del estero  catamarca and jujuy  presently has million acres of cotton requiring  tons of cotton planting seed per year 
the new venture  cdm mandiyu srl  has been producing high quality cottonseed  integrating ciagro s local market and distribution knowledge and d pl s cotton breeding and production capabilities with monsanto s biotechnology expertise 
cdm mandiyu has been licensed to sell d pl cotton varieties containing monsanto s bollgard gene technology 
commercialization is planned for fiscal pending final approval from certain argentine governmental agencies 
future plans include the production and sale of roundup ready cottonseed varieties 
in july  d pl china and the anhui provincial seed corporation formed a new joint venture  anhui an dai cotton seed technology company  ltd  which is located in hefei  anhui province  china 
under the terms of the joint venture agreement  the newly formed entity will produce  condition and sell acid delinted d pl varieties of cottonseed which contain monsanto s bollgard gene 
in the fall of  the company harvested sufficient seed from seed plots in anhui to plant up to  acres 
in november   d m international llc and maeda administracao e participacoes ltda  an affiliate of agropem agro pecuria maeda sa  formed a new joint venture in minas gerais  brazil 
the new company  mdm maeda deltapine monsanto algodao ltd  will produce  condition and sell acid delinted d pl varieties of cottonseed 
it is anticipated that the new company will produce and delint enough cottonseed in to plant up to  acres 
the newly formed company will introduce transgenic cotton seed varieties  both bollgard and roundup ready  into the brazilian market as soon government approvals are obtained 
the company reached an agreement with parties in zimbabwe in to form a joint venture that will provide high quality acid delinted seed to farmers in zimbabwe 
initially  the plant was to continue to process and sell locally developed and owned varieties which will be genetically transformed so they contain the bollgard gene technology and potentially other technologies developed in the future 
the introduction of these technologies into locally developed germplasm is expected to provide both large commercial growers as well as the small communal growers a significant economic advantage over those who do not use these technologies 
the zimbabwean government has refused to approve the joint venture contract without certain changes which are unacceptable to d m international  llc 
the company believes government approval will be forthcoming  although modifications to the current agreement may be necessary and negotiations are ongoing 
the company s delinting plants in south africa and argentina process foundation seed grown in these countries 
the use of southern hemisphere winter nurseries and seed production programs such as these can accelerate the introduction of new varieties because d pl can raise at least two crops per year by taking advantage of the southern hemisphere growing season 
in addition  the company introduced deltapine varieties which contain bollgard in south africa in the fall of sales are ongoing and inventory sufficient to plant up to  acres is available 
the results of operations of d pl s wholly owned australian subsidiary continue to be disappointing 
although the company began selling seed containing the bollgard gene ingard tm in australia in  operating results and product market share remain at unacceptable levels 
the company  through its australian operations  is identifying smaller potential export markets for the company s products throughout southeast asia 
the adaptability of the company s germplasm must be evaluated before such sales can be made and the recent instability of the economies in some of the countries in this region will make successful market development a challenge 
net sales and licensing fees in  d pl s consolidated net sales and licensing fees increased to million from sales of million 
the increase is primarily the result of a increased sales of stripper cottonseed containing monsanto s roundup ready gene b increased sales of picker cottonseed containing both the bollgard and roundup ready genes  and c the commercial introduction of soybean seed containing monsanto s roundup ready gene 
these increases were partially offset by lower sales of picker cottonseed varieties resulting from inclement weather during the planting season and commodity prices 
the usda estimated that the planted cotton acreage will approximate million acres in which is a decrease of from cotton acres planted of million 
soybean unit sales also increased over due to increased planted soybean acres and market share gains by the company s varieties 
in  the company and monsanto changed the method used to calculate the acres to be used for billing purposes for the bollgard and roundup ready gene technologies 
in prior years  the farmers were billed based on their stated planting rates  which  if within a prescribed range for a particular geographic territory  were used for purposes of calculating the number of licensed acres and therefore billable acres 
in assumed planting rates were established by d pl and monsanto for seven specific territories and farmers were billed for the number of acres that could be planted for each bag of seed sold  using the predetermined territorial formula 
in  total transgenic seed sales comprised approximately of total domestic unit sales of cottonseed  compared to in roundup ready soybean units comprised of total units sold in versus less than in international sales including exports increased in to million from million in  primarily from the initial sales derived from hebei jai dai  the joint venture in shiujiazhuang  hebei  people s republic of china 
although the level of sales by the company s first chinese joint venture were below initial estimates  the venture may report a slight profit in  its first full calendar year of operation 
in  d pl s consolidated net sales and licensing fees increased to million  from sales of million 
this increase is primarily the result of increased bollgard seed sales and licensing fees over and seed sales and licensing fees received from the first sale of commercial quantities of roundup ready cottonseed 
domestic picker cottonseed unit sales decreased by while domestic stripper cottonseed units increased due to the conversion of the high plains market despite a reduction in the total number of cotton acres planted in the us to million from million 
net billable bollgard acres increased to million in from million in net billable roundup ready acres were million in soybean unit sales also increased over primarily due to an increase in planted acres which resulted in part from cold  wet weather early in the planting season when cotton is typically planted and higher soybean prices  causing a shift in planted acres to soybean from cotton 
international sales increased to million in from million in  primarily attributable to licensing fees received from sales in australia and mexico of cottonseed varieties containing monsanto s bollgard gene  the positive effects of which were partly offset by reduced export sales 
gross profit d pl s consolidated gross profit after special and nonrecurring charges was million in compared to million in special pretax charges of approximately million were recorded in that relate a additional inventory reserves established to provide for excess inventory resulting from a reduction in planted cotton acres in and the further realignment of the company s product line to seed with new technologies  and b a recall of certain products that did not meet the company s quality standards 
gross margin expressed as a percentage of sales before the special charges was consistent between and at 
d pl s consolidated gross profit after special charges was million in compared to million in in the company recorded special charges of million that related to the earlier than expected phase out of certain products and other reserves established for a production cost and plant optimization program  the negative impact of which was offset by increased unit sales and increased licensing fees 
gross margin expressed as a percentage of sales before special charges was consistent between and at approximately 
operating expenses in  the company s total operating expenses increased  as planned  to million before special charges  from million before special charges in and million before special charges in international operating expenses are expected to increase million in due to new international ventures and other general expansion while domestic operating expenses are expected to increase about million 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily related to additional transgenic costs associated with development and evaluation of new technologies  transformation of the company s product line and collaboration with outside research providers 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily the result of additional transgenic costs associated with evaluation of new technologies  transformation of the company s sure grow and paymaster product lines  increased technical service department costs  increased varietal testing in certain international markets and further expansion of research programs related to international activities 
selling expenses selling expenses increased in to million from in the increase was primarily due to an aggressive advertising and promotional program and expansion of the international sales and marketing in china 
selling expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to the expansion of sales and marketing departments for the paymaster division and the international division  primarily in australia 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were essentially flat between and general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase is primarily attributable to the expansion of the company s information systems department  and additional staff for the international and paymaster divisions

s 
department of justice s review of that transaction 
interest expense interest expense increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to higher outstanding borrowings throughout the year used to finance international ventures and higher inventory levels  the effects which were partially offset by lower interest rates 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in due primarily to lower interest rates partially offset by higher outstanding borrowings 
other in  and  other income included primarily gains on sales of fixed assets and accounts payable discounts received for early payments

net income per share basic before special charges was   and in  and  respectively 
net income per share basic after special charges was   and in  and  respectively 
the number of shares deemed outstanding for those periods increased because of the exercise of stock option grants pursuant to the stock option plan and the long term incentive plan 
furthermore  the effect of all stock splits are included in all earnings per share calculations 
liquidity and capital resources the seasonal nature of the company s business significantly impacts cash flow and working capital requirements 
the company maintains credit facilities  uses early payments by customers and uses cash from operations to fund working capital needs 
for more than years d pl has borrowed on a short term basis to meet seasonal working capital needs 
d pl purchases seed from contract growers in its first and second fiscal quarters 
seed conditioning  treating and packaging commence late in the first fiscal quarter and continue through the third fiscal quarter 
seasonal borrowings normally commence in the first fiscal quarter and peak in the third fiscal quarter 
loan repayments normally begin in the middle of the third fiscal quarter and are typically completed by the first fiscal quarter of the following year 
d pl also offers distributors  dealers and farmers financial incentives to make early payments 
in fiscal  d pl received approximately million in early payments 
to the extent d pl attracts early payments from customers  bank borrowings under the credit facility are reduced 
the company records receivables for licensing fees on bollgard and roundup ready seed sales as the seed is shipped  usually in the company s second and third quarters 
the company has contracted the billing and collection activities for bollgard and roundup ready licensing fees to monsanto 
in september  the technology fees are due at which time d pl receives payment from monsanto 
d pl then pays monsanto its royalty for the bollgard and roundup ready licensing fees 
in april  the company entered into a syndicated credit facility with its existing lender and two other financial institutions which provides for aggregate borrowings of million 
this agreement provides a base commitment of million and a seasonal commitment of million 
the base commitment is a long term loan that may be borrowed upon at any time and is due april  the seasonal commitment is a working capital loan that may be drawn upon from september through june of each fiscal year and expires april  each commitment offers variable and fixed interest rate options and requires the company to pay facility or commitment fees and to comply with certain financial covenants 
at august   the company had million available for borrowing under the base commitment 
in addition the lead lender has approved a million credit line that can be activated by the company as needed 
the financial covenants under the loan agreements require the company to a maintain a ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth at august  of less than or equal to to to at the company s other quarter ends b maintain a fixed charge ratio at the end of each quarter greater than or equal to to and c maintain at all times tangible net worth of not less than the sum of i million  plus ii of net income but not losses determined as the last day of each fiscal year  commencing with august  at august  the company s ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth exceeded the permitted ratio 
the financial institutions waived compliance with this covenant 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the expenditures exclude acquisitions which aggregated million the company anticipates that domestic capital expenditures will approximate million in  excluding expected capital expenditures for foreign joint ventures which will be funded by cash from operations  borrowings or investments from joint venture partners  as necessary 
capital expenditures in for international ventures are expected to range from million to million depending on the timing and outcome of such projects 
cash provided from operations  early payments from customers and borrowings under the loan agreement should be sufficient to meet the company s working capital needs 
risks and uncertainties from time to time  the company may publish forward looking statements relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance  existing products  technical developments  new products  research and development activities  preparation for year issues  and similar matters 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
in order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor  the company notes that a variety of factors could cause the company s actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the company s forward looking statements 
the risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations  performance  development and results of the company s business include those noted elsewhere in this item and the following d pl s contemplated merger with monsanto is subject to shareholder approval as well as approval by government agencies 
the inability to complete this merger may have a material effect on the company 
however  such effect cannot be known at this time 
demand for d pl s seed will continue to be affected by government programs and  most importantly  by weather 
demand for seed is also influenced by commodity prices and the demand for a crop s end uses such as textiles  animal feed  food and raw materials for industrial use 
these factors  along with weather  influence the cost and availability of seed for subsequent seasons 
weather impacts crop yields  commodity prices and the planting decisions that farmers make regarding both original planting commitments and  when necessary  replanting levels 
the planting seed market is highly competitive and d pl varieties face competition from a number of seed companies  diversified chemical companies  agricultural biotechnology companies  governmental agencies and academic and scientific institutions 
a number of chemical and biotechnology companies have seed production and or distribution capabilities to ensure market access for new seed products 
the company s seed products may encounter substantial competition from technological advances by others or products from new market entrants 
many of the company s competitors are  or are affiliated with  large diversified companies that have substantially greater resources than the company 
the production  distribution or sale of crop seed in or to foreign markets may be subject to special risks  including fluctuations in foreign currency  exchange rate controls  expropriation  nationalization and other agricultural  economic  tax and regulatory policies of foreign governments 
particular policies which may affect the international operations of d pl include the testing and quarantine and other restrictions relating to the import and export of plants and seed products and the availability or lack thereof of proprietary protection for plant products 
in addition  united states government policies  particularly those affecting foreign trade and investment  may impact the company s international operations 
overall profitability will depend on weather conditions  government policies in all countries where the company sells products  worldwide commodity prices  the company s ability to successfully open new international markets  the company s ability to successfully continue development of the high plains market  the technology partners ability to obtain timely government approval and maintain such approval for existing and for additional biotechnology products on which they and the company are working and the company s ability to produce sufficient commercial quantities of high quality planting seed of these products 
any delay in or inability to successfully complete these projects may affect future profitability 
due to the varying levels of agricultural and social development of the international markets in which the company operates and because of factors within the particular international markets targeted by the company  international profitability and growth may be less stable and predictable than domestic profitability and growth have been in the past
