general 
on march   tokos and healthdyne merged with and into the company  which was created solely for the purpose of the merger 
the merger was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and tokos was deemed to be the acquiror since its shareholders received approximately of the newly issued shares of matria common stock 
in march  healthdyne acquired a ownership interest in nrmc  and effective june   the company acquired the remaining 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the company s present operations and future prospects may be influenced by several factors  including developments in the healthcare industry  third party reimbursement policies and practices  and changes in regulatory requirements or the manner in which such requirements are enforced 
as a result of the increasing cost of health care in the united states and overall efforts to reduce or control government and corporate spending  government and third party payors are becoming increasingly focused on promoting cost effective healthcare services  and payors  in particular  have become more involved in decisions regarding diagnosis and treatment to ensure that care is delivered in a cost effective manner 
a substantial portion of the company s current revenues are derived directly from third party payors for services rendered to patients by the company 
the financial performance of all healthcare companies  including the company  could be adversely affected by the financial condition of certain governmental and private payors and by their continuing efforts to reduce healthcare costs by lowering reimbursement rates  increasing medical reviews of invoices for services and negotiating for reduced contract rates 
the company and its predecessor companies have responded to these developments by attempting to emphasize cost effective therapies and procedures  pre qualifying insurance coverage prior to the delivery of services and educating third party payors on the benefits of the company s home therapies 
although reduction in the reimbursement rates that the company receives for services rendered could have an adverse impact on the company  the company is hopeful that the overall cost effective nature of treatment in the home as compared to hospitalization  coupled with the potential benefits to be derived from prenatal care  will be recognized and encouraged by any new healthcare initiatives 
the company s revenues from its preterm labor management business tend to be seasonal 
revenues typically begin to decline with the onset of the holiday season starting with thanksgiving causing the first quarter revenues of each year to be less than those of the fourth quarter of the previous year 
over the previous four year period the decline in revenues from the fourth to first quarters has averaged 
management believes that the company s quarterly revenues will continue to be impacted by this seasonality 
in addition  a letter from the food and drug administration to physicians  reiterating that the use of terbutaline sulfate for the management of preterm labor is an off label use  caused the company to refocus the efforts of its sales force to educating physicians and payors on clinical and regulatory issues  which has had a negative impact on the company s revenues in the first quarter of the trend within the healthcare industry to deliver quality healthcare services in a more cost effective manner had an impact on the company s predecessors and is expected to continue to have an impact on the company 
driven by employers and third party payors  as well as by legislation and regulation  prices for services provided to patients  in general  are being reduced  cost effective preventative health care is being stressed and vertically integrated networks of care providers some of whom are accepting the insurance risk of providing care through capitation contracts with third party payors are being established 
matria anticipates that this trend will continue and is attempting to focus its efforts on services  some of which are offered in conjunction with third party payors  which it believes can benefit from this new environment 
there can be no assurance  however  that either additional changes or presently unforeseen consequences from this trend may not develop 
the following discussion of the results of operations and financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes of the company included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  as filed with the securities and exchange commission the commission 
the results of the company include the results of healthdyne only since march  and nrmc only since june  and also include certain costs and expenses associated with the merger 
the historical results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that will be achieved by the company during future periods 
results of operations 
revenues increased million or in and million or in the decline in revenues experienced by tokos throughout  which was primarily a result of decreases in preterm labor management patient service days  continued throughout and early  however  it was offset by the additional healthdyne revenues included in the company s revenues from march  and by the additional nrmc revenues included in the company s revenues from june  additional revenues were also realized in and million and  respectively from the marketing of the fetal fibronectin immunoassay ffn  a new in vitro diagnostic test used as an aid in assessing the risk of preterm delivery in women 
through a marketing agreement entered into by tokos in  the company had exclusive rights to market this test in the united states  canada and puerto rico 
the company began marketing the test in as a means of predicting whether preterm delivery was likely in women with symptoms associated with preterm labor 
in march  the company entered into a settlement agreement with the manufacturer of the tests in the litigation over the exclusive rights to distribute the test see item legal proceedings herein 
under the terms of the settlement  the company has agreed to relinquish its distribution rights and equity interest in adeza in exchange for the opportunity to recoup its investment over time  from payments based upon future sales of the product 
as a result  following a six month transition period  revenues on sales of ffn are expected to be substantially reduced 
cost of revenues as a percent of revenues for decreased to from and in and  respectively 
the reductions of costs of revenues as a percentage of the preterm labor management business to in from in and in were primarily achieved through consolidation of service sites and operating efficiencies related to the merger 
these reductions were partially offset by the inclusion of the results of operations of nrmc in and  whose costs of revenues as a percentage of revenues were in and in selling and administrative expenses declined as a percentage of revenues in to from and in and  respectively  primarily due to synergies achieved as a result of the merger 
excluding the amortization of the additional goodwill and other intangibles associated with the merger million per year for the first three years and million per year for two additional years  the company achieved annualized cost savings on a quarterly run rate basis compared to the historical combined costs of tokos and healthdyne of approximately million in  primarily as a result of reductions of patient services center expenses in overlapping geographic locations  elimination of duplicate facilities including corporate headquarters  and synergies in staff and functional areas 
additional annualized cost savings in excess of million were achieved in as a result of the merger and the acquisition of nrmc  a large percentage of the assets reflected on the company s balance sheet are intangible assets or goodwill as opposed to tangible assets such as cash  accounts receivable  inventory and equipment 
at december   the company s total assets were million  of which million  or of total assets  were goodwill and intangibles 
the amortization or any future write down of such goodwill and intangibles by the company  if required  could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of the company 
the company provides for estimated uncollectable accounts as revenues are recognized 
the provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenues for the preterm labor management business was approximately in and in and the provision is adjusted periodically based upon the company s quarterly evaluation of historical collection experience  recoveries of amounts previously provided  industry reimbursement trends and other relevant factors 
therefore  the provision rate could vary on a quarterly basis 
nrmc collects substantially all charges for patient services at the time services are provided 
therefore  the provision for doubtful accounts for nrmc is not significant 
during  as tokos revenues continued to decline  specific decisions were made and communicated by management related to cost reduction efforts 
the cost reduction plan consisted of reductions in the workforce comprised of personnel within information systems  reimbursement  administrative support and to a lesser extent clinical services and termination of several facility leases 
in connection with these cost reduction activities  tokos incurred million of restructuring costs in in connection with the merger  the company incurred approximately million of restructuring costs which were charged to operations in of these costs  approximately million related to involuntary severance and relocation of employees  million related to the consolidation of facilities  million related to the write down of software and equipment that will be obsolete as a result of the adoption of new systems  and million related to other miscellaneous merger related costs

the net tax operating loss of approximately million will be available to offset future taxable income  if any 
liquidity and capital resources as of december  the company had cash and short term investments of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for  compared with million provided in and million provided in in  net cash flow from operating activities was reduced by million for merger related costs 
in  net cash flow was reduced by payments of million for merger related costs  million for the settlement of a former tokos shareholders lawsuit and million related to the purchase of nrmc 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in is primarily due to less acquisition activity 
the increase in is primarily due to the increase in capital expenditures relating to the upgrade of clinical computer systems at the company s sites of service and cash paid related to the acquisition of nrmc 
it is anticipated that the company s capital expenditures in will exceed those in by approximately million primarily for continued development of computer systems  including clinical and reimbursement systems 
during  tokos purchased certain physician owned companies for which it originally provided services and during and the first quarter of  healthdyne purchased the minority interest in certain affiliated partnerships 
notes issued in connection with these acquisitions have a balance outstanding of  at december  the remaining balances are to be paid through june in july  tokos reached a million settlement  subject to court approval  with the plaintiffs in a class action securities lawsuit 
tokos accrued an aggregate liability  net of insurance proceeds  of million for its portion of the settlement 
prior to the merger  tokos paid  toward the settlement 
final court approval of the settlement was received in june and in july the company made the final million payment in cash  together with accrued interest of  the company incurred substantial costs in connection with the merger 
these costs include i restructuring costs incurred by the company of approximately million  consisting of million relating to severance costs and relocations of employees  million of lease termination costs for duplicate facilities  million for the write off of computer equipment and million for other merger related expenses  ii additional liabilities incurred by healthdyne as a result of the merger of approximately million  consisting of million relating to severance costs of terminated employees and  for patient service centers specifically identified to be closed  and iii transaction costs of approximately million  consisting of million for investment banking fees  million for legal and accounting fees and  for other costs such as document printing and mailing and filing fees 
as of december  the remaining liability for these estimated costs was approximately million of which approximately will be paid in the first half of additionally  the company may be required to make additional severance payments of approximately million in accordance with employment agreements with certain officers of healthdyne 
during  the company terminated a nonqualified defined benefit plan and allowed existing participants to either receive a lump sum payment or to rollover their future benefit into a split dollar life insurance contract whereby the participants or their beneficiaries are entitled to the greater of the contract s cash surrender value or the contract s death benefit  less insurance premiums paid by the company 
the net present value of the future cash payments by the company for the participants split dollar contract is approximately million 
the participants who chose the lump sum payout were paid approximately million on january  in  the company entered into a credit agreement with a leading national banking organization for a million secured line of credit that is available for general corporate purposes 
there were no amounts outstanding at december  the company believes that its current cash balances  expected cash flows from operations and investing activities and amounts available under the credit agreement will be sufficient to finance its current operations and fund any expansion of the business for the foreseeable future
