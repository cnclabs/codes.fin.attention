recent events the semiconductor industry in general  and the dram market in particular  is experiencing a severe downturn 
per megabit prices declined approximately in following a decline in and a decline in these extreme market conditions  while having an adverse effect on the company s results of operations  have also resulted in the company being presented with various strategic opportunities 
on september   the company completed its acquisition the acquisition of substantially all of the semiconductor memory operations of texas instruments  inc ti 
the acquisition was effected through the issuance of mti debt and equity securities 
upon closing  ti received approximately million shares of mti common stock  million principal amount  seven year  notes convertible into an additional approximate million shares of mti common stock the convertible notes  and million principal amount  seven year  subordinated notes the subordinated notes 
in addition to ti s memory assets  the company received approximately million in cash 
the company and ti also entered into a ten year  royalty free  life of patents  patent cross license that commences on january  in addition  the parties have agreed to make cash adjustments to ensure that current assets minus the sum of current and noncurrent assumed liabilities of the acquired operations is million as of september  in light of the current market conditions in the semiconductor industry  the acquisition is expected to compound the effects of the downturn on the company and have a near term adverse effect on the company s results of operations and cash flows 
see subsequent events acquisition and certain factors 
on october   the company issued to intel corporation intel approximately million stock rights the rights exchangeable into non voting class a common stock upon mti shareholder approval of such class of stock or into common stock of the company  for a purchase price of million 
the rights at the time of issuance represented approximately of the company s outstanding common stock 
the rights or class a common stock will automatically be exchanged for or converted into the company s common stock upon a transfer to a holder other than intel or a owned subsidiary of intel 
the company has agreed to seek shareholder approval to amend its certificate of incorporation to create the non voting class a common stock at the company s next annual meeting of shareholders 
in the event the company s shareholders approve the amendment  the rights will be automatically exchanged for class a common stock upon the filing in delaware of the amended certificate of incorporation 
in the event the company s shareholders do not approve the amendment  the rights will remain exchangeable into the company s common stock 
in order to exchange the rights for the company s common stock  intel would be required to provide the company with written evidence of compliance with the hart scott rodino act hsr filing requirements or that no hsr filings are required 
intel also has the right to designate a nominee acceptable to the company to the company s board of directors 
in consideration for intel s investment  the company has agreed to commit to the development of direct rambus dram rdram products  to meet certain production and capital expenditure milestones and to make available to intel a certain percentage of its semiconductor memory output over a five year period  subject to certain limitations 
the exchange ratio of the rights and conversion ratio of the class a common stock is subject to adjustment under certain formulae at the election of intel in the event mti fails to meet the production or capital expenditure milestones 
no adjustment will occur to the exchange ratio or conversion ratio under such formulae i if the company achieves the production and capital expenditure milestones  or ii unless the price of the company s common stock for a twenty day period ending two days prior to such milestone dates is lower than the market price of the company s common stock at the time of the investment

other net sales for include revenue of approximately million from mcms  which was sold in february see subsequent events acquisition for a discussion of the acquisition as it relates to net sales of the company s semiconductor memory products 
total net sales in decreased by compared to  principally due to an approximate decline in average selling prices of semiconductor memory products for the year  offset by increased volumes of semiconductor memory products sold and increased unit sales of pc systems 
total megabits of semiconductor memory shipped in increased by approximately over levels 
this increase was principally a result of shifts in the company s mix of semiconductor memory products to a higher average density  transitions to successive reduced die size shrink versions of existing products and improved manufacturing yields on existing products 
the company s meg dram comprised approximately and  respectively  of net sales of semiconductor memory in and the company s principal semiconductor memory product in was the meg dram  which comprised approximately of net sales of semiconductor memory 
the company transitioned from the meg to the meg dram as its primary memory product in the fourth quarter of the company also transitioned from edo to synchronous dram sdram in the third quarter of approximately of the company s dram revenue was attributable to sdram products for net sales of pc systems in were flat compared to primarily due to a decrease in average selling prices for the company s pc systems offset by an increase in unit sales and a higher level of non system revenue 
the decline in average selling prices was primarily attributable to a decrease in the selling prices for the company s desktop pc systems and a decline in selling prices for notebook systems 
lower prices were largely the result of industry price competitiveness  particularly for notebook products  and to the company s efforts to price its products more in line with its competition 
unit sales were higher in compared to due primarily to a increase in unit sales of the company s notebook products 
net sales in decreased by compared to  principally due to an approximate decline in average selling prices of semiconductor memory products for the year  offset by increased volumes of semiconductor memory products sold and increased unit sales of pc systems 
total megabits shipped in increased by more than over levels 
this increase was principally a result of the transition to the meg dram as the company s principal memory product  ongoing transitions to shrink versions of existing memory products  enhanced yields on existing memory products  the conversion of all of the company s fabs to inch wafer processing at the end of and an increase in total wafer outs 
unit sales of pc systems increased by in compared to  while average selling prices for pc systems declined 
higher unit sales were largely attributed to significantly higher government and corporate sales 
gross margin change change dollars in millions gross margin  as a of net sales see subsequent events acquisition for a discussion of the acquisition as it relates to gross margin on the company s semiconductor memory products 
the company s gross margin percentage was significantly lower for compared to this decline in gross margin percentage was principally the result of lower gross margin percentages on sales of the company s semiconductor memory products resulting principally from a continued severe decline in average sales prices 
the company s gross margin percentage on sales of semiconductor memory products for was compared to and in and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin percentage on sales of semiconductor memory products for the periods presented was primarily the result of the continuing sharp decline in average selling prices of in and in  partially offset by a decline in per megabit manufacturing costs in each period 
decreases in the company s manufacturing costs per megabit in each period were achieved principally through increases in production 
these increases in production resulted principally from shifts in the company s mix of semiconductor memory products to a higher average density  transitions to successive shrink versions of existing products and improved manufacturing yields on existing products 
the gross margin percentage for the company s pc operations for was  compared to and in and  respectively 
the gross margin percentage for sales of the company s pc systems decreased in compared to primarily as a result of significantly lower margins realized on sales of the company s notebook systems as a result of intense price pressure on these products during the year and due to losses realized from disposition of pc component inventories 
the company s gross margin in was favorably affected  however  by an adjustment made in the fourth quarter of million related to revisions of estimates for certain contingencies for product and process technology costs 
the decrease in gross margin percentage for compared to was principally a result of lower average selling prices for semiconductor memory products and higher net sales of pc systems as a percentage of total net sales 
the lower gross margin percentage on sales of semiconductor memory products in was principally due to sharp declines in average selling prices for such products as compared to more gradual decreases in per megabit manufacturing costs 
decreases in the company s manufacturing costs per megabit were achieved through the transition to the meg dram as the company s principal memory product  ongoing transitions to successive shrink versions of existing memory products  enhanced yields on existing memory products  the conversion of all of the company s fabs to inch wafer processing at the end of and an increase in total wafer outs 
the effect on the company s gross margin from the decrease in semiconductor gross margin was compounded by higher net sales of pc systems as a percentage of net sales  as sales of pc systems generally had a lower gross margin percentage than sales of the company s semiconductor memory products in and cost of goods sold includes estimated costs of settlement or adjudication of asserted and unasserted claims for patent infringement prior to the balance sheet date and costs of product and process technology licensing arrangements 
the gross margin was increased by a net reduction of approximately million in prior year accruals for product and process rights contingencies for both semiconductor and personal computer operations 
selling  general and administrative change change dollars in millions selling  general and administrative as a of net sales see subsequent events acquisition for a discussion of the acquisition as it relates to selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses were higher in as compared to and in as compared to primarily due to increased expenses associated with the company s pc operations 
the higher level of selling  general and administrative expenses for the company s pc operations is principally due to higher levels of personnel  advertising and technical and professional fees associated with information technology consulting services 
the higher selling  general and administrative expenses for were partially offset by a lower level of performance based compensation than in during the fourth quarter of  the company charged operations with a million accrual relating to revisions of estimates for selling costs associated with sales of pc systems 
research and development change change dollars in millions research and development as a of net sales see subsequent events acquisition for a discussion of the acquisition as it relates to research and development 
research and development expenses relating to the company s semiconductor memory operations  which constitute substantially all of the company s research and development expenses  vary primarily with the number of wafers processed  personnel costs  and the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development 
research and development efforts are focused on advanced process technology  which is the primary determinant in transitioning to next generation products 
application of advanced process technology currently is concentrated on shrink versions of the company s meg sdram and development of the company s meg sdram and rdram  double data rate ddr  synclink  flash and sram memory products 
the company transitioned from the meg to the meg dram as its primary memory product in the fourth quarter of and transitioned from edo to sdram in the third quarter of other research and development efforts are devoted to the design and development of ric  flat panel displays  graphics accelerator products and pc systems 
the company substantially completed its transition from 
mu to 
mu in the fourth quarter of and expects to transition from 
mu to 
mu in calendar and transition to 
mu in calendar the company s process technology is expected to progress to tighter geometries in the next few years as needed for the development of future generation semiconductor products 
other operating expense income other operating expense for includes charges associated with pc operations of million resulting from employee termination benefits and consolidation of domestic and international operations and million from the write off of software development costs 
other operating expense reflects a net pre tax loss of million and million  and a net pre tax gain of million from the write down and disposal of semiconductor manufacturing operations equipment in  and  respectively 
gain on sale of investments and subsidiary stock in a public offering in february  mti sold million shares of mei common stock for net proceeds of million and mei sold million newly issued shares for net proceeds of million  resulting in a consolidated pre tax gain of million 
the sales reduced the company s ownership of the outstanding mei common stock from approximately to approximately 
the company also recorded pre tax gains totaling million for relating to sales of investments 
diluted earnings per share for benefited by from these gain transactions 
restructuring charge results of operations for were adversely affected by a million pre tax restructuring charge resulting from the decisions by its then approximately owned subsidiary  mei  to discontinue sales of zeos brand pc systems and to close the related pc manufacturing operations in minneapolis  minnesota 
the restructuring charge reduced earnings per share by 
income tax provision benefit change change dollars in millions income tax provision the effective tax rate for  and was  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate primarily reflects i the statutory corporate income tax rate and the net effect of state taxation  ii the effect of taxes on the parent of the earnings or loss by domestic subsidiaries not consolidated with the company for federal income tax purposes  and iii in  the impact of a million valuation allowance recorded for a deferred tax asset relating to mei s consolidation of its netframe enterprise server operations 
the relatively higher effective tax rate in was principally due to the provision for income taxes by the company on earnings of its domestic subsidiaries  and the gain on the sale of mei common stock by the company and the issuance of common stock by mei in taxes on earnings of domestic subsidiaries not consolidated for tax purposes may cause the effective tax rate to vary significantly from period to period

 which is required for the first quarter of liquidity and capital resources as of september   the company had cash and liquid investments totaling million  representing a decrease of million during as of september   approximately million of the company s consolidated cash and liquid investments were held by mei 
cash generated by mei is not readily available or anticipated to be available to finance operations or other expenditures of mti s semiconductor memory operations 
upon closing of the acquisition on september   the company received million 
in addition  the company and ti have agreed to make cash adjustments to ensure that current assets minus the sum of current and noncurrent assumed liabilities of the acquired operations is million 
as part of the transaction  the company also issued notes in an aggregate principal amount of million 
the company currently estimates it will spend approximately million over the next three years  primarily for equipment  to upgrade the acquired facilities 
in addition  it is expected that in the near term  per unit costs associated with products manufactured at the acquired facilities will significantly exceed the per unit costs of products manufactured at the company s boise  idaho  facility 
as a result  it is expected that the acquisition will have an adverse impact upon the company s results of operations and cash flows in the near term 
see subsequent events acquisition and certain factors 
on october   the company issued to intel approximately million stock rights the rights exchangeable into non voting class a common stock upon mti shareholder approval of such class of stock or common stock of the company for a purchase price of million 
the proceeds from this investment are expected to be used for the development of next generation products  including rdram  and certain capital expenditures related to this effort 
see subsequent events equity investment 
the company s principal sources of liquidity during were net cash proceeds totaling million from the sale of a interest in mei s contract manufacturing subsidiary  mcms  net cash flow from operations of million and proceeds of million from the issuance of long term debt 
the principal uses of funds in were million for property  plant and equipment and million for repayments of equipment contracts and long term debt 
the company believes that in order to develop new product and process technologies  support future growth  achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality  it must continue to invest in manufacturing technology  facilities and capital equipment  research and development and product and process technology 
as of september   the company had entered into contracts extending into the year for approximately million for equipment purchases and approximately million for the construction of facilities 
the company estimates it will spend approximately million in the next fiscal year for purchases of equipment and construction and improvement of buildings at the company s facilities  including the facilities obtained in the acquisition 
cash flows from operations for were significantly lower than cash flows from operations for cash flows from operations are significantly affected by average selling prices and variable cost per unit for the company s semiconductor memory products 
for  average selling prices for semiconductor memory products declined at a rate faster than that which the company was able to decrease costs per megabit  and as a result  the company s cash flows have been significantly and adversely affected 
the company has a billion shelf registration statement under which million in convertible subordinated notes were issued in july and under which the company may issue from time to time up to an additional million in debt or equity securities 
the company has an aggregate of million in revolving credit agreements  including a million agreement expiring in may which contains certain restrictive covenants pertaining to the company s semiconductor memory operations  including a maximum total debt to equity ratio 
as of september   the company was in compliance with all covenants under the facilities and had borrowings totaling approximately million outstanding under the agreements 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be able to meet the terms of the covenants and conditions in the agreements  borrow under the agreements  renegotiate satisfactory new agreements or replace the existing agreements with satisfactory replacements 
subsequent events acquisition on september   the company completed its acquisition of substantially all of ti s memory operations 
the acquisition was consummated through the issuance of debt and equity securities 
ti received approximately million shares of mti common stock  million principal amount of convertible notes and million principal amount of subordinated notes 
in addition to ti s memory assets  the company received million in cash 
the company and ti also entered into a ten year  royalty free  life of patents  patent cross license that commences on january  the parties have also agreed to make cash adjustments to ensure that current assets minus the sum of current and noncurrent assumed liabilities of the acquired operations is million as of september  the mti common stock and convertible notes issued in the transaction have not been registered under the securities act of  as amended  and are therefore subject to certain restrictions on resale 
the company and ti entered into a securities rights and restrictions agreement as part of the transaction which provides ti with certain registration rights and places certain restrictions on ti s voting rights and other activities with respect to shares of mti common stock 
ti s registration rights begin on march  the convertible notes and the subordinated notes issued in the transaction bear interest at the rate of and have a term of seven years 
the convertible notes are convertible into approximately million shares of mti common stock at a conversion price of approximately per share 
the subordinated notes are subordinated to the convertible notes  the company s outstanding convertible subordinated notes due july   and substantially all of the company s other indebtedness 
the assets acquired by the company in the acquisition include a wafer fabrication operation in avezzano  italy  an assembly test operation in singapore  and a wafer fabrication facility in richardson  texas 
ti closed the richardson memory manufacturing operation in june also included in the acquisition was ti s interest in two joint ventures and ti s rights to of the output of the joint ventures tech semiconductor singapore tech  owned by ti  canon  inc  hewlett packard singapore private limited  a subsidiary of hewlett packard company  and edb investments pte 
ltd  which is controlled by the economic development board of the singapore government  and kti semiconductor kti in japan owned by ti and kobe steel  ltd 
mti acquired an approximate interest in tech and a interest in kti 
the company filed form k a on october   which incorporates historical and pro forma financial information with respect to the acquisition 
although the company believes the acquisition further leverages its technology  the company anticipates that the acquisition will have a near term adverse impact upon the company s results of operations and cash flows 
the company expects to transfer its product and process technology into the acquired facilities primarily the wholly owned fabrication facilities in avezzano  italy and the joint venture facilities  kti and tech over the next to months 
output of the company s semiconductor memory products will increase directly as a result of the manufacturing capacity obtained in the acquisition and should increase further as a result of the transfer of the company s product and process technology in the acquired facilities 
until the company is able to complete the transfer of its product and process technology into the acquired facilities  the company expects that the per unit costs associated with products manufactured at the acquired facilities will significantly exceed the per unit costs of products manufactured at the company s boise  idaho facility  resulting in a near term adverse impact on the company s gross margin percentage 
the ten year  royalty free  life of patents  patent cross license entered into with ti will result in a significant reduction in the company s royalty expenses beginning january  annual selling  general and administrative expense is expected to increase by approximately million in future periods as a result of the acquisition 
the increased selling  general and administrative expense associated with the acquired operation is primarily for information technology services and systems 
research and development efforts will continue to be coordinated from boise  idaho 
annual research and development expense is expected to increase by approximately million as a result of the acquisition 
the increase in research and development expense will be related primarily to the company s efforts to broaden its range of dram product offerings necessitated by the expected increase in the company s market share 
net interest expense is expected to increase as a result of the convertible notes and subordinated notes issued in the acquisition 
the company currently estimates it will spend approximately million over the next three years  primarily for equipment  to upgrade the wholly owned facilities acquired in the acquisition 
pursuant to the acquisition  the company acquired the right and obligation to purchase of the production output of tech and kti 
under the terms of the joint venture agreements  assembled and tested components are purchased at a discount from the company s worldwide average sales prices 
these discounts are currently higher than gross margins realized by the company in recent periods on similar products manufactured in the company s wholly owned facilities  but are lower than gross margins historically realized in periods of relatively constrained supply 
at any future reporting period  gross margins for semiconductor memory products resulting from the company s right to purchase joint venture products may positively or negatively impact gross margins depending on the then existing relationship of average selling prices to the company s cost per unit sold for product manufactured in its wholly owned facilities 
equity investment on october   the company issued to intel approximately million stock rights exchangeable into non voting class a common stock upon mti shareholder approval of such class of stock or into common stock of the company for a purchase price of million 
the rights at the time of issuance represented approximately of the company s outstanding common stock 
the rights or class a common stock will automatically be exchanged for or converted into the company s common stock upon a transfer to a holder other than intel or a owned subsidiary of intel 
the company has agreed to seek shareholder approval to amend its certificate of incorporation to create the non voting class a common stock at the company s next annual meeting of shareholders 
in the event the company s shareholders approve the amendment  the rights will be automatically exchanged for class a common stock upon the filing in delaware of the amended certificate of incorporation 
in the event the company s shareholders do not approve the amendment  the rights will remain exchangeable into the company s common stock 
in order to exchange the rights for the company s common stock  intel would be required to provide the company with written evidence of compliance with the hart scott rodino act hsr filing requirements or that no hsr filings are required 
the mti common stock issued to intel has not been registered under the securities act of  as amended  and is therefore subject to certain restrictions on resale 
the company and intel entered into a securities rights and restrictions agreement which provides intel with certain registration rights and places certain restrictions on intel s voting rights and other activities with respect to the shares of mti class a common stock or common stock 
intel s registration rights begin on march  intel also has the right to designate a nominee acceptable to the company to the company s board of directors 
in consideration for intel s investment  the company has agreed to commit to the development of rdram and to certain production and capital expenditure milestones and to make available to intel a certain percentage of its semiconductor memory output over a five year period  subject to certain limitations 
the exchange ratio of the rights and conversion ratio of the class a common stock is subject to adjustment under certain formulae at the election of intel in the event mti fails to meet the production or capital expenditure milestones 
no adjustment will occur to the exchange ratio or conversion ratio under such formulae i if the company achieves the production and capital expenditure milestones  or ii unless the price of the company s common stock for a twenty day period ending two days prior to such milestone dates is lower than the market price of the company s common stock at the time of investment 
in addition  in no event will the company be obligated to issue more than a a number of additional shares of class a common stock or common stock having a value exceeding million  or b a number of additional rights exceeding the number of shares originally issued 
merger on september   the company completed a stock for stock merger with rendition  inc rendition 
rendition designs  develops and markets high performance  low cost  multi functional graphics accelerators to the personal computer market 
the merger was accounted for as a business combination using the pooling of interests method 
shareholders of rendition received approximately million shares of the company s common stock 
year like many other companies  the year computer issue creates risks for the company 
if internal systems do not correctly recognize and process date information beyond the year  the company s operations could be adversely impacted as the result of system failures and business process interruption 
the following year discussion does not incorporate year issues as they relate to the acquisition 
see subsequent events acquisition and certain factors 
the company has been addressing the year computer issue with a plan that began in early to manage its year program  the company has divided its efforts into the primary program areas of i information technology it  which includes computer and network hardware  operating systems  purchased development tools  third party and internally developed software  files and databases  end user extracts and electronic interfaces  ii manufacturing equipment  and iii external dependencies  which include relationships with suppliers and customers 
the company is following four general steps for each of these program areas ownership  wherein each department manager is responsible for assigning ownership for the various year issues to be tested  identification of systems and equipment and the collection of year data in a centralized place to track results of compliance testing and subsequent remediation  compliance testing  which includes the determination of the specific test routine to be performed on the software or equipment and determination of year compliance for the item being tested  and remediation  which involves implementation of corrective action  verification of successful implementation  finalization of  and  if need be  execution of  contingency plans 
as of september   the ownership and identification steps were essentially complete for all three program areas it  manufacturing equipment and external dependencies 
the compliance testing and remediation steps are substantially complete for the it area 
at present  a large portion of the company s manufacturing equipment has yet to be subjected to compliance testing 
the majority of the equipment so tested has either tested year compliant or had minor failures  the nature of which was inconsequential to the continued operation of the equipment 
compliance testing on the balance of the company s equipment set in boise  idaho  will be completed by mid the company is currently in the process of assessing embedded technology associated with its pc systems manufacturing equipment and expects the evaluation to be complete in the fourth quarter of calendar the company is currently working with suppliers of products and services to determine and monitor their level of compliance and compliance testing 
year readiness of significant customers is also being assessed but is in very early stages 
the company s evaluation of year compliance as it relates to the company s external dependencies is expected to be complete by mid the cost of addressing the company s year issues is expected to be immaterial 
the company is executing its year readiness plan solely through its employees 
year compliance testing and reprogramming is being done in conjunction with other ongoing maintenance and reprogramming efforts 
with respect to remediation  the company has commenced work on various types of contingency plans to address potential problem areas with internal systems and with suppliers and other third parties 
internally  each software and hardware system has been assigned to on call personnel who are responsible for bringing the system back on line in the event of a failure 
externally  the company s year plan includes identification of alternate sources for providers of goods and services 
the company expects its contingency plans to be complete by mid certain factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k  the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement made by or on behalf of the company 
the semiconductor memory industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent product introductions and enhancements  difficult product transitions  relatively short product life cycles  and volatile market conditions 
these characteristics historically have made the semiconductor industry highly cyclical  particularly in the market for drams  which are the company s primary products 
the semiconductor industry has a history of declining average sales prices as products mature 
long term average decreases in sales prices for semiconductor memory products approximate on an annualized basis  however  significant fluctuations from this rate have occurred from time to time  including in recent periods 
the selling prices for the company s semiconductor memory products fluctuate significantly with real and perceived changes in the balance of supply and demand for these commodity products 
growth in worldwide supply has outpaced growth in worldwide demand in recent periods  resulting in a significant decrease in average selling prices for the company s semiconductor memory products 
the semiconductor industry in general  and the dram market in particular  is experiencing a severe downturn 
per megabit prices declined approximately in following a decline in and a decline in in the event that average selling prices continue to decline at a faster rate than that at which the company is able to decrease per unit manufacturing costs  the company could be materially adversely affected in its operations  cash flows and financial condition 
future consolidation by competitors in the semiconductor memory industry may place the company at a disadvantage in competing with competitors that have greater capital resources 
competitors are also aggressively seeking improved yields  smaller die size and fewer mask levels in their product designs 
these improvements could result in a dramatic increase in worldwide capacity leading to further downward pressure on prices 
approximately of the company s sales of semiconductor memory products during were directly into the pc or peripheral markets 
drams are the most widely used semiconductor memory component in most pc systems 
should the rate of growth of sales of pc systems or the rate of growth in the amount of memory per pc system decrease  the growth rate for sales of semiconductor memory could also decrease  placing further downward pressure on selling prices for the company s semiconductor memory products 
the company is unable to predict changes in industry supply  major customer inventory management strategies  or end user demand  which are significant factors influencing pricing for the company s semiconductor memory products 
on september   the company acquired substantially all of ti s memory operations 
the integration and successful operation of the acquired operations is dependent upon a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the company s ability to transfer its product and process technology in a timely and cost effective manner into the wholly owned acquired fabrication facilities in avezzano  italy and joint venture facilities in japan kti and singapore tech 
the company expects the transfer of its product and process technology into these fabrication facilities to take approximately to months  however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to meet this timeline 
until such time as the company is able to complete the transfer of its product and process technology into the acquired fabrication facilities  it is expected that the per unit costs associated with the products manufactured at the acquired fabrication facilities will exceed significantly the per unit costs of products manufactured at the company s boise  idaho  facility 
as a result  it is expected that the transaction with ti will have a near term adverse effect on the company s results of operations and cash flows 
the acquisition is expected to have a significant effect on the company s future results of operations and cash flows  including  but not limited to a considerable negative impact on gross margin in the near term due in part to significantly higher per unit manufacturing costs at the acquired facilities  costs related to the assimilation of the acquired operations  increased research and development expense associated with the company s efforts to broaden its range of dram product offerings  increased interest expense associated with the convertible notes and subordinated notes to be issued in the transaction  increased capital spending relating to the wholly owned acquired facilities in avezzano  italy and singapore  and the potential for further downward pressure on the average selling prices the company receives on its semiconductor memory products 
the company has limited experience in integrating or operating geographically dispersed manufacturing facilities 
it is expected that the integration and operation of the acquired facilities will place significant strains on the company s management and information systems resources 
failure by the company to effectively manage the integration of the acquired facilities could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
as a result of the acquisition  the company has substantially increased its share of the worldwide dram market and its production capacity  and as a result  the company s results of operations are further subject to fluctuations in pricing for semiconductor memory products 
in addition  if the company is successful in the transfer of its product and process technology into the acquired facilities  the amount of worldwide semiconductor memory capacity could increase  resulting in further downward pricing pressure on the company s semiconductor memory products 
in connection with the acquisition  the company and ti entered into a transition services agreement requiring ti to provide certain services and support to the company for specified periods following the acquisition 
ti is to provide information technology  finance and accounting  human resources  equipment maintenance  facilities and purchasing services under the services agreement 
the successful integration and operation of the acquired facilities is partially dependent upon the successful provision of services by ti under the services agreement 
there can be no assurance that the services and support called for under the services agreement will be provided in a manner sufficient to meet anticipated requirements 
the failure to obtain sufficient services and support could impair the company s ability to successfully integrate the acquired facilities and could have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations 
for a period of approximately months  the company will rely in part on ti computer networks and information technology services with respect to certain of its acquired facilities 
during this period and beyond  the company will also be utilizing software obtained or licensed from ti to conduct specific portions of business operations 
dependency upon ti systems will span calendar years and  during which period year issues may arise 
the company is evaluating year preparations associated with information technology services provided by ti and with the operations acquired in the acquisition 
the company is in the process of developing year contingency plans for the acquired operations 
if unforeseen difficulties are encountered in ending the company s reliance upon ti s software  hardware or services or in segregating the companies information technology operations or with year issues  the company s results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
international sales comprised of the company s net sales in  and the company expects international sales to increase in as a result of the acquisition 
in addition  the company will significantly expand its international operations as a result of the acquisition 
international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks  including those arising from currency fluctuations  export duties  changes to import and export regulations  possible restrictions on the transfer of funds  employee turnover  labor unrest  longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  the burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of foreign laws and  in certain parts of the world  political instability 
while to date these factors have not had an adverse impact on the company s results of operations  there can be no assurance that there will not be such an impact in the future  particularly arising from the acquisition 
pursuant to the acquisition  the company acquired the right and obligation to purchase of the production output of the tech joint venture in singapore and the kti joint venture in japan 
under the terms of the joint venture agreements  assembled and tested components are purchased at a discount from the company s worldwide average sales prices 
these discounts are currently higher than gross margins realized by the company in recent periods on similar products manufactured in the company s wholly owned facilities  but are lower than gross margins historically realized in periods of relatively constrained supply 
at any future reporting period  gross margins for semiconductor memory products resulting from the company s right to purchase joint venture products may positively or negatively impact gross margins depending on the then existing relationship of average selling prices to the company s cost per unit sold for product manufactured in its wholly owned facilities 
the company s operating results are significantly impacted by the operating results of its consolidated subsidiaries  particularly mei 
mei s past operating results have been  and its future operating results may be  subject to seasonality and other fluctuations  on a quarterly and an annual basis  as a result of a wide variety of factors  including  but not limited to  industry competition  the company s ability to accurately forecast demand and selling prices for its pc products  fluctuating market pricing for pcs and semiconductor memory products  seasonal government purchasing cycles  inventory obsolescence  the company s ability to effectively manage inventory levels  changes in product mix  manufacturing and production constraints  fluctuating component costs  the effects of product reviews and industry awards  critical component availability  seasonal cycles common in the pc industry  the timing of new product introductions by the company and its competitors and global market and economic conditions 
changing circumstances  including but not limited to  changes in the company s core operations  uses of capital  strategic objectives and market conditions  could result in the company changing its ownership interest in its subsidiaries 
the company is engaged in ongoing efforts to enhance its production processes to reduce per unit costs by reducing the die size of existing products 
the result of such efforts has led to a significant increase in megabit production over recent periods 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain or approximate increases in megabit production at a level approaching that experienced in at the company s boise  idaho  facilities or that the company will not experience decreases in manufacturing yield or production as it attempts to implement future technologies at its boise  idaho  facility and the facilities acquired in the acquisition 
further  from time to time  the company experiences volatility in its manufacturing yields  as it is not unusual to encounter difficulties in ramping latest shrink versions of existing devices or new generation devices to commercial volumes 
the semiconductor memory industry is characterized by frequent product introductions and enhancements 
the company s ability to reduce per unit manufacturing costs of its semiconductor memory products is largely dependent on its ability to design and develop new generation products and shrink versions of existing products and its ability to ramp such products at acceptable rates to acceptable yields  of which there can be no assurance 
historically  the company has reinvested substantially all cash flow from semiconductor memory operations in capacity expansion and enhancement programs 
the company s cash flow from operations depends primarily on average selling prices and per unit manufacturing costs of the company s semiconductor memory products 
if for any extended period of time average selling prices decline faster than the rate at which the company is able to decrease per unit manufacturing costs  the company may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to sustain operations 
cash generated by mei is not readily available or anticipated to be available to finance the company s semiconductor operations 
the company has an aggregate of million in revolving credit agreements  including a million agreement expiring in may  which contains certain restrictive covenants pertaining to the company s semiconductor memory operations  including a maximum total debt to equity ratio 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be able to meet the terms of the covenants or be able to borrow the full amount of the credit facilities 
there can be no assurance that  if needed  external sources of liquidity will be available to fund the company s operations or its capacity and product and process technology enhancement programs 
failure to obtain financing would hinder the company s ability to make continued investments in such programs  which could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
completion of the company s semiconductor manufacturing facility in lehi  utah was suspended in february  as a result of the decline in average selling prices for semiconductor memory products 
as of september   the company had invested approximately million in the lehi facility 
timing of completion of the remainder of the lehi production facilities is dependent upon market conditions 
market conditions which the company expects to evaluate include  but are not limited to  worldwide market supply and demand of semiconductor products and the company s operations  cash flows and alternative uses of capital 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to fund the completion of the lehi manufacturing facility 
the failure by the company to complete the facility would likely result in the company being required to write off all or a portion of the facility s cost  which  if required  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
in addition  in the event that market conditions improve  there can be no assurance that the company can commence manufacturing at the lehi facility in a timely  cost effective manner that enables it to take advantage of the improved market conditions 
the semiconductor and pc industries have experienced a substantial amount of litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to the company  to protect trade secrets or know how owned by the company  or to defend the company against claimed infringement of the rights of others 
the company has from time to time received  and may in the future receive  communications alleging that its products or its processes may infringe product or process technology rights held by others 
the company has entered into a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements with third parties  some of which require one time or periodic royalty payments 
it may be necessary or advantageous in the future for the company to obtain additional patent licenses or to renew existing license agreements 
the company is unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on terms acceptable to the company 
adverse determinations that the company s manufacturing processes or products have infringed on the product or process rights held by others could subject the company to significant liabilities to third parties or require material changes in production processes or products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company is dependent upon a limited number of key management and technical personnel 
in addition  the company s future success will depend in part upon its ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel  particularly as the company engages in worldwide operations and adds different product types to its product line  which will require parallel design efforts and significantly increase the need for highly skilled technical personnel 
the company competes for such personnel with other companies  academic institutions  government entities and other organizations 
the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  increased recruitment of its existing personnel by other employers 
the company s ability to retain key personnel in the facilities acquired will be a critical factor in the company s ability to successfully integrate the acquired operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in hiring or retaining qualified personnel 
any loss of key personnel or the inability to hire or retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk substantially all of the company s liquid investments and long term debt are at fixed interest rates  and therefore the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates 
substantially all of the company s liquid investments mature within one year 
as a result  the company believes that the market risk arising from its holdings of financial instruments is minimal
