item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general kaye group inc the company  a delaware corporation  formerly old lyme holding corporation holding  is a holding company which  through its subsidiaries  is engaged in a broad range of insurance brokerage  underwriting and related activities 
the company operates in two insurance business segments the insurance brokerage companies operations comprised of the retail brokerage business and the program brokerage business  and the property and casualty companies operations property and casualty companies or insurance  which comprises the insurance companies and claims administration see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
the revenues and expenses of the property and casualty companies segment will not be comparable to the amounts reported previously by holding 
historically  the commission income of the program brokerage business was recorded as a reduction of acquisition costs in the consolidated statements of income of holding 
as a result of the combination see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company  management includes the commission income and the other revenues and operating costs of the program brokerage business in the insurance brokerage companies segment for all periods presented 
overview the insurance brokerage companies derive their revenue principally from commissions associated with the placement of insurance coverage for corporate clients 
these commissions are paid by the insurance carriers and are usually a fixed percentage of the total premiums 
certain of these commissions are contingent upon the level of volume and profitability of the related coverage to the insurance companies 
there is normally a lag between receipt of funds from the insured and payment to the insurance company 
investment of these funds over this period generates additional revenue in the form of interest income 
the insurance business underwrites property and casualty risks for insureds in the united states and is sold principally through specially designed programs  covering various types of businesses and properties which have similar risk characteristics 
the insurance business generally underwrites the first layer of insurance under the programs and unaffiliated program insurers provide coverage for losses above the first layer of risk 
substantially all of the insurance business revenues are derived from premiums on this business  plus the investment income generated by the investment portfolio of the insurance business 
corporate operations include those activities that benefit the company in its entirety and cannot be specifically identified to either the insurance brokerage companies or the property and casualty companies 
such activities include debt servicing and public company expenses  including investor relations costs 
the company has foreign operations in bermuda

a comprehensive analysis of the results of operations of the company would not be meaningful without consideration of the charge in lieu of taxes 
the provision for income taxes  as reported in the historical financial statements  does not provide for any income taxes on certain subsidiaries of the company prior to the combination on october  prior to the combination on october   the retail partnerships and the retail brokerage companies were either limited partnerships or s corporations under the internal revenue code  and therefore  the individual partners or shareholders  rather than the companies were liable for income taxes

year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year

the company has assessed the problem  has an action plan in place with resources dedicated to resolution and the work is in progress 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources  reprogram  or replace  and test the software for year modifications 
the company has purchased and will be implementing new operational and accounting software which is year compliant 
certain other software that was developed internally is being reprogrammed 
other software purchased such as word processing and spreadsheet programs are guaranteed to be year compliant by the manufacturers 
we will test this software accordingly 
while the cost for the new operational and accounting software is material  only a small portion of such cost is related to year programming 
other costs to the company related to year compliance will not be material 
management has concluded that year procedures will be completed in a timely fashion 
it is not anticipated that the year issue will have a material affect on future financial results 
the company will initiate formal communications with all of its significant insurance markets to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties year concerns
