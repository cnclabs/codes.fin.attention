background the company is a research based pharmaceutical and medical device company engaged in the development  manufacturing and marketing of naturally occurring complex carbohydrate and other natural products for therapeutics in the treatment of major illnesses and the dressing and management of wounds and other skin conditions 
the company sells nonprescription products through its wound and skin care division  veterinary medical devices and pharmaceutical products through its veterinary medical division  and consumer products and bulk ingredients through its consumer products subsidiary  caraloe  inc see note thirteen to the consolidated financial statements for financial information on each of the segments 
the company s research and product portfolio is primarily based on complex carbohydrate technology derived naturally from the aloe vera plant 
liquidity and capital resources at december  and  the company held cash and cash equivalents of  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash of  was largely attributable to the repurchase of of the series e shares outstanding see note seven to the consolidated financial statements  which totalled  also contributing to the decrease in cash was the payment of approximately  in cancellation fees related to the second phase iii clinical study for aliminase 
tm 
oral capsules described below 
additionally  the company has invested in inventory to support the launch of several new product lines during described below and to support sales of bulk products to mannatech  inc  and aloe commodities international  inc 
receivables from these two customers totaled  and  respectively  as of december  as of march    of the above balances has been collected 
these decreases in cash were partially offset by private placement of common stock see note eight to the consolidated financial statements which was completed on june  total proceeds  net of issuance costs  were  while wound care sales grew at a rate of to  in  the consumer products and bulk ingredients sales through caraloe  inc grew by to  much of this growth was the result of the decision to significantly grow the bulk ingredients segment of the business  where sales grew from  in to  in this had a direct impact on the utilization of the costa rica plant discussed below as well as on inventory levels both in costa rica and in irving  texas  where bulk ingredient inventories grew by  and  respectively  during in addition  finished goods inventory grew  as initial quantities of products launched in were produced or brought in from outside manufacturers 
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas  in the first quarter of sfas requires that long lived assets held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable 
at the time of adoption  there was no impairment of asset values in the company based on historical production levels and future capacity requirements needed to produce the company s drug aliminase 
tm  then under initial phase iii clinical trials see discussion below 
in late october  the company received the results of the initial phase iii clinical trial for the testing of aliminase 
tm 
oral capsules  which indicated no statistically significant differences that would support a conclusion that aliminase 
tm 
oral capsules provide a therapeutic effect in the treatment of ulcerative colitis 
as a result  the company terminated the second large scale clinical trial and placed further testing of aliminase 
tm 
oral capsules on hold 
these results triggered a new assessment of the recoverability of the costs of the costa rica plant s assets using the methodology provided by sfas in the fourth quarter of the net book value of the costa rica plant assets as of december   was  the company evaluated the value of costa rica produced components in its current product mix to determine the amount of net revenues  excluding manapolr powder sales to mannatech see discussion of caraloe sales to mannatech below  attributable to the costa rica plant 
cash inflows for and future years were estimated using management s current forecast and business plan 
all direct costs of the facility  including certain allocations of company overhead  were considered in the evaluation of cash outflows 
results indicated there was no impairment of value under sfas in addition  the increase in bulk ingredients sales discussed above prompted the company to announce in december that it was increasing production at the costa rica plant in through the installation of a high speed filling line for health maintenance drinks and that it was planning for the acquisition of additional acreage to be used for production of aloe vera l 
as a result of the increased production levels  the company believes that the risk of a future impairment of value for the costa rica plant under sfas has been greatly diminished 
however  there is no assurance that future changes in product mix or the content of costa rica produced components in the current products will generate sufficient revenues to recover the costs of the plant under sfas methodology 
as of march   the company had no material capital commitments other than its leases and agreements with suppliers 
in february  the company entered into a supply agreement with its supplier of freeze dried products 
the agreement required that the company establish a letter of credit equal to of the minimum purchase commitment of  but allowed for the amount of the letter of credit to be reduced by of the purchases made under the agreement 
in july  the letter of credit was reduced under this provision of the agreement to  the supplier currently produces the carrasorb

aphthous ulcer patch for the company 
both of these products represent new technology and are still in the early phase of marketing 
the company had approximately  of carrasorb 
tm 
m and carrington 
tm 
aphthous ulcer patch inventory on hand as of december  the supply agreement also requires the company to make minimum monthly purchases of  in february  the supply agreement was amended to allow for unmet monthly minimum purchase amounts to be met by prepayments  to be applied to future purchases under the agreement  which allows the company to keep inventory at levels appropriate for sales demand 
current sales of both items are lower than the minimum purchase requirement  but the company believes that as licensing  acceptance and demand for the new technology increases  demand will exceed the aggregate minimum purchase requirement 
as of march   the company has purchased products totaling approximately  from this supplier 
the company is in full compliance with the agreement and  as of march   has the available resources to meet all future minimum purchase requirements 
in november  the company signed a licensing agreement with a supplier of calcium alginates and other wound care products

hydrocolloid  a new product launched in the third quarter of these payments resulted in increasing other assets of the company 
as of december   the net book value of this agreement was  additional payments totaling  will be made to the supplier as new products are delivered 
the company began a large scale clinical trial during the third quarter of for the testing of its aliminase 
tm 
oral capsules for the treatment of acute flare ups of ulcerative colitis 
the cost of this clinical trial was approximately  all expenses related to this trial have been recognized and paid 
in the third quarter of  the company began a second large scale clinical trial for the testing of aliminase 
tm 
oral capsules for the treatment of ulcerative colitis 
the cost of this trial was expected to be approximately  of which approximately  was required as an initial payment when the research contract was signed on september  the full amount of the initial payment was expensed in the third quarter 
in late october  the company received the results of the initial phase iii clinical trial for the testing of aliminase 
tm 
oral capsules  which indicated that no statistically significant differences were found to support a therapeutic effect 
as a result  the company terminated the second large scale clinical trial and placed further testing of aliminase 
tm 
oral capsules on hold 
approximately  in cancellation fees was recorded in relation to this termination 
in  the company began efforts to reformulate aliminase 
tm 
into a reconstitutable powder form 
the reformulation was completed  and the company began collecting sufficient data to submit to the fda for permission to conduct a new phase iii clinical study for aliminase 
tm 
as of march  the company has not yet met with the fda on this matter 
in late  the company began an initial phase i study using carravex

injectable formerly carn in cancer patients involving six cancer types 
the estimated cost of this study is  of which approximately  had been expensed as of december  expenses totaling  were recorded in no expenses have been incurred in the first quarter of in october  the company completed a  financing involving the private placement of series e convertible preferred stock the series e shares 
at that time  plans called for much of the proceeds from this sale to be used to continue carrington s clinical research programs see note seven to the consolidated financial statements 
on october   the company announced the results of the first phase iii trial of aliminase 
tm 
oral capsules 
due to the unfavorable results of the first phase iii trial  the aliminase 
tm 
project was placed on hold 
additionally  the company s management canceled the second phase iii clinical trial then under contract 
this event resulted in significant changes in the company s planned uses of and need for these funds 
in addition to the change in the company s needs  the decline in the market price of the company s common stock had increased the extent of the dilution that would have occurred if all of the series e shares then outstanding were converted into common stock 
for these and other reasons  the company s board of directors concluded that it was in the best interest of the company and its shareholders that the company repurchase the series e shares see note seven to the consolidated financial statements 
on march   the company completed a repurchase of of the series e shares for a premium of over the original purchase 
on may  the company repurchased the remaining series e shares from the series e shareholders for a total cash purchase price of approximately  for both transactions  amounts paid to preferred shareholders in excess of par totaled  more than the embedded deemed dividend recognized in this additional deemed dividend was used in the earnings per share calculation in to reduce net income available to common shareholders 
in november  the company entered into an agreement with comerica bank texas for a  line of credit  secured by accounts receivable and inventory 
this credit facility will be used for operating needs  as required  and to secure the reissuance of the letter of credit described above 
this will result in freeing an additional  in operating funds  as the certificate of deposit currently serving as collateral will no longer be required 
the company believes that its available cash resources and expected cash flows from operations will provide the funds necessary to finance its current operations 
however  the company does not expect that its current cash resources will be sufficient to finance the major clinical studies and costs of filing new drug applications necessary to develop its products to their full commercial potential 
additional funds  therefore  may have to be raised through equity offerings  borrowings  licensing arrangements or other means  and there is no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such funds on satisfactory terms when they are needed 
the company is subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
certain of the company s proposed products will require governmental approval prior to commercial use 
the approval process applicable to prescription pharmaceutical products usually takes several years and typically requires substantial expenditures 
the company and any licensees may encounter significant delays or excessive costs in their respective efforts to secure necessary approvals 
future united states or foreign legislative or administrative acts could also prevent or delay regulatory approval of the company s or any licensees products 
failure to obtain requisite governmental approvals or failure to obtain approvals of the scope requested could delay or preclude the company or any licensees from marketing their products  or could limit the commercial use of the products  and thereby have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and financial condition 
impact of inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its results of operations 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales were  in  compared with  in this increase of  or  resulted from an increase of  or  in sales of caraloe  inc  the company s consumer products subsidiary  and an increase of  or  in sales of the company s wound and skin care products 
total sales of the company s wound and skin care products in were  as compared to  in  an increase of  or 
new products introduced in accounted for  in wound and skin care sales during in the past  the company s wound and skin care products have been marketed primarily to hospitals and select acute care providers 
this market has become increasingly competitive as a result of pressures to control health care costs 
hospitals and distributors have reduced their inventory levels and the number of suppliers used 
also  health care providers have formed group purchasing consortiums to leverage their buying power 
this environment required the company to offer greater discounts and allowances to maintain customer accounts 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of  the medicare medicaid reimbursement rate for hydrogels was significantly reduced from ounce per day to ounces per month 
these changes significantly reduced the demand for hydrogels in the market place 
in february  the company revised its price list to more accurately reflect current market conditions 
overall wound and skin care prices were lowered by a weighted average of 
in addition to these cost pressures  over the last several years the average hospital stay has decreased over  resulting in more patients being treated at alternative care facilities and at home by home health care providers 
this also had a negative impact on sales since the company s sales force had been primarily focused on the hospital market 
to counter the market changes  the sales force is now also aggressively pursuing the alternative and home health care markets 
to continue to grow its wound care business  the company realized that it had to expand from the estimated million hydrogel market in which it competed to a much larger segment of the estimated billion dollar wound care market 
to achieve this objective  an aggressive program of new product development and licensing was undertaken in with the goal of creating a complete line of wound care products to address all stages of wound management 
as a result of this program  the company launched three new wound care product types in and nine new wound care product types in caraloe s sales increased from  to  or 
caraloe sales to mannatech increased from  to  of the sales   was related to the sale of bulk manapolr powder 
the supply agreement in effect during provided mannatech with an exclusive license for the manapolr trademark worldwide and contained a provision for termination of the agreement upon days advance notice 
caraloe was informed by mannatech in january that the supply agreement would be terminated on march  as the supply agreement between mannatech and caraloe was terminated  the exclusive license agreement for the manapolr trade mark also terminated on march  caraloe was then able to sell manapolr powder or license the trademark to other third parties as well as use it in caraloe s products 
in august  caraloe entered into new licensing and supply agreements with mannatech granting a non exclusive license for the use of the manapolr trademark for a three year period 
sales of the company s veterinary products decreased from  to  in march  the company entered into an agreement with farnam companies  inc  a leading marketer of veterinary products  to promote and sell the company s veterinary line on a broader scale  including the introduction of the company s products under farnam s private label 
in  farnam s sales of the company s products were negatively impacted by the backorder of acemannan immunostimulant 
production should recommence on schedule in farnam has increased its sales force to improve the market share of the private labeled products 
cost of sales decreased from  to  or 
as a percentage of sales  cost of sales decreased from  after adjusting for period cost write offs discussed below  to 
the decrease in cost of goods sold is largely attributable to volume related manufacturing efficiencies realized in costa rica due to the increased caraloe manapolr sales 
the benefits of these manufacturing efficiencies were partially offset by the lower profit margins earned on manapolr as compared to wound care products 
cost of goods sold in included  of additional expenses which consisted of a  inventory valuation decrease on june   as described below  and period costs of  the period costs were related to the annual shutdown of the facility in costa rica for routine maintenance and inventory reduction programs 
as a result of the implementation of programs to reduce operating and production costs  several changes were implemented at the company s costa rica production facility in early this facility produces all of the company s freeze dried aloe vera raw materials 
among these changes was a restructuring of the work force as well as improvements in efficiencies in the manufacturing process 
the implementation of these changes significantly reduced the cost of costa rica production in the second quarter of as a result of these reductions in cost  the actual cost of production under fifo as of june   was approximately lower than the company s standard cost  which was equal to the fifo cost of production at december  and march  the company determined that the standard cost should be reset to the then current actual cost of production 
this reduction in standard fifo cost decreased inventory valuation by  this amount represented the change in the accumulated value of all items in inventory as of june  that were produced in costa rica as well as those finished goods that contain component items produced in costa rica 
this decrease in inventory value was expensed in as a period cost and was included in cost of sales 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to  from  or 
partially offsetting the increase was approximately  in one time charges incurred in which were not incurred in these one time charges included approximately  in additional costs related to the launch of three new product types and a one time write off of approximately  of bank and legal charges related to the early retirement of all bank debt in also contributing to the modest size of the increase in sg a expenses were the ongoing benefits received from cost reduction programs put in place in and the restructuring of the sales force  also put in place in  which were continued in research and development r d expenses decreased to  from  or 
this decrease was the result of discontinuing the phase iii clinical program for the testing of aliminase
