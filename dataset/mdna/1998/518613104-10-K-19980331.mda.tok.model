the plans continued to be valid for the company even after the nec acquisition was terminated 
the impaired assets  consisting of computer equipment and software  were impaired as a result of changes in the technical requirements and specifications of certain computer hardware and software 
the amount of the impairment loss was determined by evaluating the likely sales proceeds from the disposition of the assets compared to their book value 
the company determined that it was unlikely that the net cash proceeds from the sale of any assets would be significant  and therefore recorded an impairment loss equal to the net book value of the assets of million 
investment and other income increased by million to million during  primarily due to the million non cash dividend income received from the company s investment in jlc holdings  inc and the higher cash and investment balances resulting from the nec termination fee and the proceeds received from the sale of the company s common stock during the company s interest expense decreased by million due to the repayment of all outstanding educational inroads debt in the second quarter of the company reported losses of million in from its investment in affiliates  consisting primarily of million attributable to caliber learning network  inc  in which the company has an equity investment

sylvan s investment in working capital continues to reduce net cash flow from operations  particularly as a result of the growth in accounts and notes receivable 
the million increase in accounts and notes receivable is principally the result of a increase in revenue during of the million cash flow reduction attributable to an increase in accounts and notes receivable  million is related to sylvan s expanding testing contracts and million is related to new and expanded public school contracts 
the increase in amounts due from expanding testing contracts resulted from higher domestic testing volumes and a significant increase in billings under the international contract with ets to establish overseas testing capacity 
ets typically makes monthly payments for domestic activity and quarterly payments for international services 
accounts receivable from public school based programs have increased due to billings under new contracts obtained in and notes receivable for new area development agreements accounted for million of the increase in and a note receivable from one of the former owners of wsi accounted for another million

this component will be earned if other revenue targets relating to portions of the combined computer based testing business are achieved in or with the measuring year selected by the sellers 
sylvan has put in place a corporate wide year task force with representatives for each business segment

effects of inflation inflation has not had a material effect on sylvan s revenues and income from continuing operations in the past three years 
inflation is not expected to have a material future effect 
quarterly fluctuations sylvan s revenues and operating results have varied substantially from quarter to quarter and may continue to vary  depending upon the timing of implementation of new computer based testing contracts and contracts funded under title i or similar programs 
based on sylvan s limited experience  revenues generated by computer based testing services may vary based on the frequency or timing of delivery of individual tests and the speed of test administrators conversion of tests to computer based format 
in addition  franchise license fees earned by the company in its core educational services and testing services segments may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
revenues or profits in any period will not necessarily be indicative of results in subsequent periods
