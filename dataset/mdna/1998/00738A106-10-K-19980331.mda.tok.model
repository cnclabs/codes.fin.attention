item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company designs  develops  manufactures  markets and services a broad range of high speed digital transmission products utilized by telcos and corporate end users to implement advanced digital data services over existing telephone networks 
the company currently sells its products to telcos including all of the rbocs  and private end users in the cpe market 
the company s sales have increased in each year due primarily to increases in the number of units sold to both new and existing customers 
these annual sales increases reflect the company s strategy of increasing unit volume and market share through the introduction of succeeding generations of products having lower selling prices and increased functionality as compared both to the prior generation of a product and to the products of competitors 
an important part of the company s strategy is to engineer the reduction of the product cost of each succeeding product generation and then to lower the product s price based on the cost savings achieved 
as a part of this strategy  the company seeks in most instances to be a low cost  high quality provider of products in its markets 
the company s success to date is attributable in large measure to its ability to initially design its products with a view to their subsequent re design  allowing efficient enhancements of the product in each succeeding product generation 
this strategy has enabled the company to sell succeeding generations of products to existing customers as well as to increase its market share by selling these enhanced products to new customers 
while the company has experienced increased sales in each year  the company s operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly basis in the past  and operating results may vary significantly in future periods due to a number of factors 
the company operates with very little order backlog 
a substantial majority of its sales in each quarter results from orders booked in that quarter and firm purchase orders released in that quarter by customers under agreements containing nonbinding purchase commitments 
furthermore  most telcos typically require prompt delivery of products  this results in a limited backlog of orders for these products and requires the company to maintain sufficient inventory levels to satisfy anticipated customer demand 
if near term demand for the company s products declines or if significant potential sales in any quarter do not occur as anticipated  the company s financial results will be adversely affected 
the company currently does not undertake any foreign exchange risks  as all transactions with foreign vendors or customers are conducted in currency of the united states 
operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  therefore  a shortfall in quarterly revenues could impact the company s financial results significantly in a given quarter 
further  maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of the company s products increases the amount of inventory which may become obsolete and increases the risk that the obsolescence of such inventory may have an adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
the company s operating results may also fluctuate as a result of a number of other factors  including increased competition  customer order patterns  changes in product mix  product warranty returns and announcements of new products by the company or its competitors 
accordingly  the company s historical financial performance is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results  and  in general  management expects that the company s financial results may vary from period to period
