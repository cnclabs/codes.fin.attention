item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion is intended to assist in an understanding of the company s results of operations for the three year period ended december  and its present financial condition 
the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  which are presented elsewhere herewith  contain additional detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with a review of this material 
history and overview basin is a domestic independent oil and gas company that conducts exploration activities in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico and acquisition and exploitation operations in the gulf of mexico and selected areas onshore 
the company commenced operations in and completed an initial public offering of its common stock in from its inception through  the company primarily acquired  developed and exploited properties in the denver julesburg d j basin in eastern colorado 
the company subsequently expanded into other areas within the rocky mountain region and initiated exploration activities 
during  the company s capital expenditures on oil and gas properties declined to million  from million the year before  due primarily to the following i a smaller  lower quality inventory of d j basin exploitation projects  ii limited success in identifying acquisition opportunities and viable exploration plays in the company s other rocky mountain focus areas  and iii liquidity constraints caused by higher debt levels without a commensurate increase in the company s revolving line of credit with its bank group the credit facility 
each of these factors was exacerbated by depressed regional gas prices 
in response to these developments and management s assessment of alternative investment opportunities  the company implemented a significant redirection of its business strategy and operations between late and mid  which included i the addition of new financial  technical and business development members to its senior management  ii the sale of its d j basin properties for million the d j sales  iii establishment of a houston based gulf of mexico exploration team through hiring geoscientists and petroleum engineers with substantial experience operating in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico  and iv a substantial reduction in corporate general and administrative overhead 
the d j sales  which occurred in two transactions closed in march and june  enabled the company to eliminate its long term debt and establish cash reserves  thus providing considerable liquidity for investments in new capital projects 
however  the divestitures reduced the company s estimated proved oil and gas reserves and production rates at the time by approximately  resulting in a significant initial decline in revenue and cash flow 
the company began gulf of mexico activities in with no initial property base in the region and early investments related primarily to acquisitions of three dimensional seismic data and exploratory leasehold interests and overhead 
the company s first significant discovery in the gulf of mexico was the eugene island block well  which was drilling at the end of and completed in first production from gulf of mexico assets was realized in august when the company brought two wells drilled on eugene island block on line  providing the first significant addition to the company s producing property base following the d j sales 
the company added other proved properties in the gulf of mexico in through both exploratory drilling and acquisitions and as of year end it owned interests in five producing properties and had nine wells under development on eight separate lease blocks 
seven of the wells under development are projected to commence production in the first half of the other two wells  one of which is expected to be redrilled or sidetracked due to wellbore mechanical problems  are not expected to commence production until as described below under results of operations  the company s net production has increased significantly with initiation of contributions from gulf of mexico properties 
during  the company s capital expenditures totaled approximately million  including approximately million for acquisitions of proved properties and an aggregate of million for investment in exploratory leaseholds  geological and geophysical data  exploratory drilling  completion and development activities  and other 
over of these expenditures were associated with the company s gulf of mexico operations 
capital expenditures in were funded with a combination of cash flow  working capital  borrowings under the company s credit facility  and proceeds from a public offering of common stock 
the company closed the year with a working capital deficit of approximately million  long term debt of million  and stockholders equity of million 
operating environment basin s results of operations are significantly impacted by oil and gas price levels  which are largely beyond the company s control 
changes in oil and gas prices can also impact the amount and terms of external capital resources available to the company 
gas prices generally respond to north american supply and demand conditions  including the effects of weather 
oil prices reflect global supply and demand conditions to a greater degree  including the impact on supply of decisions to limit production by petroleum exporting countries 
because the company s recent production increases have been attributable to gulf of mexico properties that are predominantly gas producing  the portion of the company s total production that is accounted for by gas has also increased 
gas production represented of the company s total production in the fourth quarter of  compared to in the first half of the year 
although the company generally can not exert control over oil and gas prices it receives  it periodically enters into fixed price sales agreements or hedging transactions to take advantage of prices that it believes to be attractive and to reduce volatility of net price realizations 
demand for drilling rigs and related products and services has been relatively high during the past two years  resulting in cost increases  occasional delays in obtaining materials and services  and some instances of decreased quality of goods and services 
recent conditions have been factored into the company s planning and investment decisions and management does not believe that such conditions will have a material adverse impact on the timing or profitability of the company s planned activities unless there is substantial further deterioration in the cost or availability of these goods and services  which is not anticipated 
the company s gulf of mexico exploration activities are dependent on the company s ability to continue to identify prospects and obtain interests in prospect leaseholds 
the company generally utilizes speculative three dimensional seismic data  which is not proprietary and therefore is available to competitors  as a tool in its prospect generation 
the broad and increasing availability of this data increases the number of potential competitors for  and tends to increase the cost of  available prospects 
during  the company was successful in expanding its inventory of potential exploratory drilling locations from approximately eight to thirty  while drilling eleven test wells 
the company also particiated in submitting high bids for twelve leases with identified exploratory properties at a central gulf of mexico lease sale held in march see properties present activities 
however  the company faces competition for prospects from a number of well capitalized oil and gas companies and there is no assurance that the company will be able to continue to acquire interests in prospects at acceptable costs to replace its current inventory of prospects as these are drilled 
the company seeks to mitigate this risk by pursuing prospect ownership through a number of avenues  including lease sales  farm ins  exchanges  and acquisitions 
the company seeks to make acquisitions of proved properties in both the gulf of mexico and in selected areas onshore 
during the past several years  competition for such property packages has been intensifying and prices paid for properties have been increasing 
the company has initiated a review of its internal information systems for year transition problems and  although such review is still in progress  believes that conversion requirements will not result in significant disruption of the company s business operations or have a material adverse impact on its future liquidity or results of operations 
the company has not extensively investigated the year compliance of its customers  suppliers  and other third parties with whom it has business relationships  but intends to make selected inquiries 
compliance by such third parties is voluntary and failures could occur  in which case there is the possibility of a material adverse impact on the company 
however  the nature of the company s business and its business relationships are not such that the company considers the potential year compliance failure of a third party with whom it has a direct business relationship likely to have a material adverse impact on the company 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating information for the three years ended december  because a substantial portion of the company s operations was conducted in the d j basin through mid when the d j sales were consummated  and because the company initiated gulf of mexico operations in and realized its first production from gulf of mexico properties in august  period to period comparisons of results of operations may not be meaningful or indicative of future results

compared to the sale of the company s d j basin assets in the first half of and realization of first production from gulf of mexico assets in the second half of result in year to year comparisons that obscure important underlying trends 
to assist in understanding such trends  the following quarterly data is provided for the two year period ended december  quarter ended march june sept 
dec 
march june sept 
dec 
production oil mbbl gas mmcf     total gas equivalents mmcfe         revenue in thousands oil sales         gas sales      total oil and gas sales         average sales price oil per bbl gas per mcf total gas equivalents per mcfe expenses per mcfe lease operating expenses production taxes depreciation  depletion  and amortization general and administrative  net revenue 
oil and gas sales for increased by million  or  to million  due largely to improved average price realizations 
an increase in gas prices combined with a decrease in oil prices to yield a net increase in revenue per net equivalent unit produced  from per mcfe in to per mcfe in production increased by in net equivalent units  from  mmcfe in to  mmcfe in the relatively small change in production volumes from year to year masks significant changes during each year  as reflected in the table above  due to the d j sales in march and june and the commencement of gulf of mexico production in august the increases in the second half of were largely attributable to eugene island block  which produced  net mmcfe between mid august and the end of the year 
the only other net production obtained from gulf of mexico assets in was net mmcfe in december from four properties acquired in late november 
in conjunction with the second d j sale transaction  which closed in june  the company recognized a non recurring million gain 
other revenue reported in both and primarily represented interest income on cash equivalents held after the second d j sale transaction prior to redeploying those proceeds into investments in oil and gas properties 
lease operating expenses 
lease operating expenses loe declined in from the prior year by million  or  and loe per mcfe produced declined by in  to  compared to in again  the relatively small changes from year to year do not reflect significant variances within each year 
average loe per mcfe by quarter  as shown in the table above  reflects that both the properties included in the d j sales and the gulf of mexico properties that began contributing in the second half of have significantly lower unit operating costs than the company s retained rocky mountain assets  which have high unit operating costs due to relatively low average production rates per well and a high proportion of oil production  which is generally more costly to produce than gas 
production taxes 
production taxes for decreased by million  or  as the result of reduced sales from onshore properties in  due to inclusion in of production from d j basin properties prior to the d j sales 
production from properties in federal waters offshore is generally not subject to production taxes and such taxes did not increase in the second half of as the company added gulf of mexico production 
production taxes therefore declined as a percentage of oil and gas sales  averaging for all of and in the second half of the year  compared to in depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased by million  or  in to million 
the average depletion rate of per mcfe of production in represents a increase from the per mcfe recorded in the higher rate is due to the addition of proved reserves in at a higher average unit cost than the company s historical average and to the unfavorable impact on estimated proved reserve quantities of using lower assumed future oil and gas prices at the end of than at the end of the increased unit cost of additions in reflects the substantial portion of the company s capital expenditures in related to the gulf of mexico  where higher unit costs are generally associated with reserves having a higher value per unit than the company s onshore properties  due to typically faster recoveries of reserves  lower production costs  and higher average realizable gas prices 
general and administrative expenses  net 
general and administrative expenses in decreased by million  or  from levels  to million 
the decrease in resulted primarily from staff reductions made in mid in conjunction with the d j sales and related reductions in office rent expense attributable to the company s relocation to smaller space 
these savings  which benefitted all of but only a portion of  were partially offset by higher bonus awards and stock based incentive compensation costs recorded in on a per mcfe basis  general and administrative expenses during the two year period generally varied inversely with production volumes  as reflected in the table above 
interest and other expense 
interest and other expense for was million  representing a decrease of million  or  compared to the variance was attributable to a decrease in average borrowing after the d j sales and a reduction in the company s average effective interest rate  reflecting lower prevailing market interest rates and more favorable borrowing terms obtained after the d j sales 
during  the company had average outstanding debt of million with an average effective interest rate of  compared to average borrowings of million and an average interest rate of in substantially all of the borrowings in both years were under the credit facility 
income tax provision 
the income tax provision for approximates the amount that would be calculated by applying statutory income tax rates to income before income taxes 
the current provision for income taxes was decreased  and the deferred provision was increased  by approximately million due to a change in estimate of current taxes payable for fiscal the difference between the income tax provision recorded for and the amount that would be calculated by applying statutory income tax rates to income before income taxes is due primarily to reversal of a previously established million deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
compared to revenue 
oil and gas sales for declined by million  or  to million  due largely to declines in oil and gas production 
an increase in oil prices combined with an decrease in gas prices to yield a net increase in revenue per net equivalent unit produced  from per mcfe in to per mcfe in production declined by in net equivalent units  from  mmcfe in to  mmcfe in this large decrease in production was primarily attributable to asset sales consummated in and  including the d j sales closed in the first half of  in which properties accounting for approximately of the company s production at the time were sold 
the decrease also reflects natural production declines outside of the d j basin  the company s net production declined by mmcfe  or  from  mmcfe in to  mmcfe in the higher oil and gas sales reported for also reflect recognition of million of gas revenue for payments received with respect to transferred section tax credits  with no comparable amount recorded in in conjunction with the second d j sale transaction  which closed in june  the company recognized a non recurring million gain 
other revenue in was primarily derived from a small processing facility that was decommissioned late in the year 
other revenue reported in was mostly interest income on cash equivalents held after the second d j sale transaction 
lease operating expenses 
lease operating expenses for were million  a decrease of million  or  compared to lease operating costs per mcfe produced during averaged 
compared to 
in these higher costs per mcfe were caused primarily by the increased portion of the company s total active wells that were oil wells  with typically higher unit operating costs  following the d j sales 
production taxes 
production taxes for were lower by million  or  than in the prior year 
however  such taxes were of oil and gas sales in compared to in because a greater portion of production in occurred in higher tax jurisdictions 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense decreased by million  or  in to million 
the decrease was primarily attributable to the lower production volumes in as compared to the depletion rate of per mcfe produced in was slightly lower than the per mcfe average depletion rate during property impairment 
during  the company recognized a property impairment charge of million as the result of the capitalized costs of its oil and gas properties exceeding a ceiling on such costs computed in accordance with prescribed accounting guidelines 
the third quarter charge was associated with historically low gas prices in the rocky mountain region at the time 
general and administrative expenses  net 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  in to million 
the decrease resulted primarily from staff reductions made during the second half of and in mid in conjunction with the d j sales  and partially due to reductions in office rent expense as a result of relocating and decreasing the size of the company s corporate headquarters 
interest and other expenses 
interest expense for totaled million  representing a decrease of million  or  compared to the variance was attributable to a decrease in average borrowings after the d j sales  partially offset by an increase in the company s average effective interest rate 
during  the company had average borrowings of million and an average interest rate of  compared to average borrowings of million and an average interest rate of in substantially all of the borrowings in both years were under the credit facility 
income tax provision benefit 
differences between the income tax provision for and the income tax benefit recorded for  and related amounts that would be calculated by applying statutory income tax rates to income before income taxes for each year  are due primarily to the reversal in of a million deferred tax asset valuation allowance established in liquidity and capital resources historically  the company s principal sources of capital have been cash flow from operations  a revolving line of credit established with a group of banks  proceeds from asset sales  and proceeds from sales of common stock 
the company s principal uses of capital have been for the exploration  acquisition  development and exploitation of oil and gas properties 
through the d j sales  the company realized proceeds of approximately million in two transactions closed in march and june a portion of these proceeds was used to repay substantially all of the company s long term debt and at the end of the company had million of net working capital  including million of cash and equivalents  and long term debt of million 
during the fourth quarter of  the company realized net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of million shares of common stock through an underwritten public offering 
the company s oil and gas capital expenditures during totaled approximately million 
net cash provided by operations before changes in working capital totaled million 
the remainder of capital expenditures was funded primarily through borrowings under the credit facility  proceeds from the stock offering  and reductions in net working capital 
the company closed with a working capital deficit of approximately million  long term debt of million  and stockholders equity of million 
at the end of  borrowings under the company s credit facility totaled million  leaving million of unutilized capacity under the line of credit  which was established at million as of november  since the november  borrowing base determination  the company has increased the value of its proved oil and gas reserves through a million acquisition before purchase price adjustments and drilling and development activities  and management anticipates that the borrowing base will be increased from the current level at the time of the next redetermination  which is scheduled to occur april  the company has established a preliminary budget of million for exploration and development in  compared to approximately million invested in such activities in this budget is subject to revision during the year to reflect future developments 
acquisitions of properties with proved and probable reserves are also pursued as an integral part of the company s overall business strategy  but are not budgeted 
the company s average daily net oil and gas production in the fourth quarter of was greater than in the first half of the year  and net cash provided by operations before working capital changes increased from an average of million per quarter in the first half of the year to million in the fourth quarter 
further increases in production are projected for  primarily from properties with proved nonproducing reserves at the end of that are expected to commence production in factoring in these projected increases  management believes that its projected cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund the company s operations and capital expenditures through the end of  unless the company consummates a substantial acquisition or significantly increases its budget for drilling activities during the period 
production and cash flow 
the properties included in the d j sales consummated in the first half of represented approximately of the company s estimated proved oil and gas reserves and production at the time 
in each of the next four fiscal quarters after the divestitures covering the period from july  through june   the company s net production of oil and gas was approximately  mmcfe  or an average of mmcfe per day 
for the same period  net cash provided by operations before working capital changes ranged from million to million per quarter and averaged million per quarter  varying primarily with oil and gas price levels 
the flat oil and gas production during this period reflected modest capital expenditures on rocky mountain exploitation projects that offset natural declines on producing properties 
more significant investments were made in gulf of mexico exploration  development  and acquisition activities that did not begin to impact production and cash flow until the middle of the third quarter of during the quarter ended december   the company s net production increased to  mmcfe  or approximately mmcfe per day  and net cash flow from operations before changes in working capital increased to million  primarily due to production from two wells that the company drilled and completed earlier in the year on eugene island block from commencement of production in mid august through december   combined net production from these two wells averaged approximately mmcfe per day 
based primarily on the estimates reflected in the company s year end reserve reports  the company anticipates that its net production in will be more than triple its net production during of  mmcfe 
this is attributable primarily to seven gulf of mexico wells with proved nonproducing reserves at the end of that were expected to commence production at various times during the company s average working interest in these seven wells is approximately 
production in should also include contributions during the full period from four producing properties acquired in late november partially offsetting these additions will be expected lower production from eugene island block  due to natural depletion related declines and to mechanical impediments that may be remediable  but which reduced average daily net production on the property by approximately mmcfe beginning mid december the company expects that its future net cash flow will be determined substantially by production levels and oil and gas prices 
certain costs per unit of production have significantly improved recently as the company has commenced production in the gulf of mexico and are expected to continue to improve as scheduled increases in gulf of mexico production occur 
production taxes are not applicable to properties in federal waters 
lease operating expenses per unit tend to be significantly lower in the gulf of mexico than for the company s rocky mountain properties  especially for flush production from relatively new gulf of mexico wells  and the company does not expect its general and administrative expenses to increase proportionately as gulf of mexico production increases 
as a result  net cash provided by operations is expected to increase by a greater percentage than production volumes  given an assumption of constant or rising oil and gas prices 
marketing and hedging transactions 
the company s production is generally sold under month to month contracts at prevailing prices 
from time to time  however  as conditions are deemed to warrant  basin has entered into hedging transactions or fixed price sales contracts for a portion of its oil and gas production 
the purposes of these transactions are to limit the company s exposure to future oil and gas price declines and achieve a more predictable cash flow 
however  such contracts also limit the benefits the company would realize if prices increase 
as of february   basin had entered into the following crude oil and natural gas price swap or collar arrangements covering the period beginning january  bbls or mcf average price product per month or collar range time period entered into on or prior to december  crude oil  crude oil  natural gas  entered into subsequent to december  natural gas  natural gas  natural gas  credit facility 
the credit facility with a bank group led by nationsbank of texas  na provides for the interest rate on the company s borrowings to be determined by reference to either nationsbank s prime rate or libor  at the company s election 
a varying spread of to is added to the prime rate  or to is applied to libor  based upon the company s debt to capitalization ratio at the time 
the credit facility provides for borrowings to be revolving loans until august   at which time the outstanding balance will be converted into a four year amortizing term loan unless the credit facility has been amended to extend the revolving period 
the borrowing base under the credit facility  established at million as of november   is scheduled to be redetermined as of april  and generally at six month intervals thereafter until converted into a term loan 
since the november  borrowing base determination  the company has increased its proved oil and gas reserves through an acquisition and drilling activities  and management anticipates that the borrowing base will be increased from the current level at the time of the next redetermination 
at december   the principal balance outstanding under the facility was million  with a weighted average interest rate of 
the credit facility contains various covenants  including ones that could limit the company s ability to incur other debt  dispose of assets  pay dividends  or repurchase stock 
pursuant to the agreement governing the credit facility  certain of the company s onshore properties are subject to mortgages in favor of the banks and the company s remaining properties are subject to a negative pledge 
capital expenditures 
since the beginning of  basin has focused its exploration activities in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico  primarily off the coast of louisiana 
the company s acquisition  development  and exploitation activities target opportunities in the vicinity of the company s gulf of mexico exploration operations  in the rocky mountain region where basin has a substantial existing base of proved reserves and producing wells  and in certain other major domestic producing basins where basin believes significant upside potential exists 
the company s capital expenditures are generally discretionary and activity levels are determined by a number of factors  including oil and gas prices  availability of funds  quantity and character of identified investment projects  availability of service providers  and competition 
the company s capital expenditures in totaled approximately million 
approximately million of this amount was used for acquisitions of proved properties and the remaining million was used primarily for exploration and development activities  including investments in prospect leaseholds and geological and geophysical data  exploratory drilling  and completion and development activities 
almost of these expenditures were associated with the company s operations in the gulf of mexico  where the company added an estimated bcfe of proved oil and gas reserves from extensions  discoveries  and purchases of reserves in place  and significantly increased its inventory of exploratory prospects  in activities in the gulf of mexico during included three acquisitions of proved properties and participation in eleven exploratory wells  eight of which have been or are expected to be completed as producers 
one of the three wells that will not be completed also encountered apparent commercial hydrocarbons but was lost due to mechanical problems and may be sidetracked or redrilled 
expenditures outside of the gulf of mexico were primarily for exploitation and development of the company s proved properties in the rocky mountain region 
the company currently estimates that its capital expenditures for exploration and development in will be approximately million 
this budget primarily provides for participation in an estimated nine net to gross exploratory wells in the gulf of mexico  development of six prospect discoveries made in the gulf of mexico in the second half of  exploitation and development of five gulf of mexico properties acquired last year  including two wells drilled in that were under development at year end  development of assumed prospect discoveries  investments in seismic data and prospect leaseholds including million provided for apparent winning bids at the central gulf of mexico lease sale held march   see properties present activities  and continued exploitation of the company s rocky mountain properties 
although several locations for planned exploratory drilling have been identified and other potential locations are held in inventory  a significant portion of the anticipated exploration budget is currently unallocated 
the company also intends to continue to pursue acquisitions of properties with proved and probable reserves as an integral part of the company s overall business strategy  with the expectation that these efforts will result in potentially significant investment activity 
the amount and allocation of future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors that are not entirely within the company s control or ability to forecast  including drilling results  scheduling of activities by other operators  availability of service providers  success in acquiring prospect leaseholds  and success in consummating acquisitions of proved properties 
as a result  actual capital expenditures may vary significantly from current expectations 
the company may significantly increase its capital expenditure budget for to respond to drilling opportunities that develop during the year in the gulf of mexico or potentially in new onshore focus areas  to fund development of a greater number or larger sized exploratory successes than assumed  or for acquisitions of proved and probable reserves or prospect leaseholds 
in such instance  the company may consider raising additional capital through issuance of debt and or equity securities
