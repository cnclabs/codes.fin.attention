prescription pharmaceuticals accounted for   and of net sales in the fiscal years ended fiscal  fiscal  fiscal  respectively 
the company believes  that as a result of the genderm acquisition  otc products will account for a greater percentage of the company s total sales in future quarters with minimal impact on the company s gross profit margins 
the company derives a majority of its revenue from sales of the key products 
the company believes that sales of the key products will constitute the majority of net sales for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  any factor adversely affecting the sale of the key products  individually or collectively  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
each of the key products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by regulatory or competitive changes 
the sale of key products could also be adversely affected by other factors  including manufacturing or supply interruptions  the development of new competitive pharmaceuticals to treat the conditions addressed by the key products  technological advances  factors affecting the cost of production  marketing or pricing actions by one or more of the company s competitors  changes in the prescribing practices of dermatologists  changes in the reimbursement policies of third party payors  product liability claims  the outcome of disputes relating to trademarks  patents and other rights or other factors 
the company s results of operations may vary from period to period due to a variety of factors  including expenditures incurred to acquire  license and promote pharmaceuticals  expenditures and timing relating to the acquisition and integration of businesses  changes in the prescribing practices of dermatologists  the introduction of new products by the company or its competitors  cost increases from third party manufacturers  manufacturing and supply interruptions  the availability and cost of raw materials  the mix of products sold by the company  changes in marketing and sales expenditures  market acceptance of the company s products  competitive pricing pressures  the outcome of disputes relating to trademarks  patents and other rights  general economic and industry conditions that affect customer demand  and the company s level of research and development activities 
in addition  the company s business has historically been subject to seasonal fluctuations  with lower sales generally being experienced in the first quarter of each fiscal year 
as a result of customer buying patterns  a substantial portion of the company s revenues has been in the last month of each quarter 
the company schedules its inventory purchases to meet anticipated customer demand 
as a result  relatively small delays in the receipt of manufactured products by the company could result in revenues being deferred or lost 
the company s operating expenses are based on anticipated sales levels  and a high percentage of the company s operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
consequently  variations in the timing of recognition of revenue could cause significant fluctuations in operating results from period to period and may result in unanticipated earnings shortfalls or losses 
there can be no assurance that the company will maintain or increase revenues or profitability or avoid losses in any future period 
in december  the company acquired of the common stock of genderm for approximately million and the company could pay an additional sum not to exceed million if sales of genderm products  as defined in the acquisition agreement  are in excess of million during calendar and certain other conditions are met the genderm earnout amount 
a significant portion of the purchase price was identified in an independent valuation  using proven valuation procedures and techniques  as intangible assets 
these intangible assets included million for acquired in process research and development in process r d for projects in development for which there is no alternative future use 
this allocation represents the estimated fair market value based on projected cash flows related to the in process r d projects 
at the date of the acquisition  the development of these projects was not yet completed and the in process r d had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed in the fiscal quarter ended december  the company estimates that approximately million will be incurred to complete the acquired in process r d projects over the four years subsequent to the acquisition 
products acquired in the genderm transaction include  among others  the prescription brands novacet r and zonalon r  as well as the otc brands zostrix r  occlusal hp r  pentrax r  and salac r 
prior to the acquisition  the company did not market any products in the topical acne rosacea treatment  anti itch medication  topical analgesic or wart treatment markets  and the company has no experience marketing such products 
successful integration of these products by the company is important to maintaining growth of sales of these products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully integrate  market and sell the products acquired from genderm  or that such products will be accepted by the market at levels previously achieved by genderm  or sufficient to maintain growth 
the failure of the company to successfully integrate  market and sell these products would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the acquisition involves a number of risks that could adversely affect the company s operating results  including the assumption of liabilities and obligations of genderm  including the liabilities and obligations which may not have been adequately disclosed to the company  the diversion of management s attention  the assimilation of the acquired operations into the company s business  and the valuation of acquired intangible assets 
the agreement governing the terms of the acquisition limits the company s remedies for any losses incurred by the company in connection with the acquisition to the indemnification rights specifically provided to the company under the agreement governing the acquisition 
the indemnification rights are limited to a maximum of million subject to certain adjustments together with the genderm earnout amount and any interest thereon 
any claims for indemnification must be made prior to august   in accordance with the terms of the agreement governing the acquisition 
there can be no assurance that the acquisition of genderm by the company will not materially and adversely affect the company or that such acquisition will enhance the company s business 
the company recognizes revenues from sales upon shipment to its customers 
at the time of sale  the company records reserves for returns based on estimates using historical experience 
sales are reported net of actual and estimated product returns and net of pricing adjustments and or discounts 
the company applies royalty obligations to the cost of sales in the period the corresponding sales are recognized 
medicis customers include the nation s leading wholesale pharmaceutical distributors  such as mckesson  bergen brunswig  cardinal  bindley western drug company and other major drug chains

during fiscal  mckesson  cardinal  and bergen brunswig accounted for  and respectively  of the company s sales 
during fiscal  mckesson  bergen brunswig and cardinal accounted for  and  respectively  of the company s sales 
the loss of any of these customer s accounts could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company plans to spend substantial amounts of capital to continue the research and development of its pharmaceutical products 
actual expenditures will depend upon the company s financial condition  as well as the results of clinical testing  delays or changes in government required testing and approval procedures  technological and competitive developments and strategic marketing decisions 
the company may increase total expenditures for research and development and expects that research and development expenditures as a percentage of net sales will fluctuate from period to period 
the company can give no assurance that the research and development projects will provide technologies or products that will be patentable  commercially feasible or acceptable to government agencies whose approval may be necessary 
the company intends to seek additional acquisitions of dermatology products to leverage its existing distribution channels and marketing infrastructure  and to aggressively market formulations of existing products 
the success of the company s efforts is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including dependence on sales of key products and integration of new product acquisitions  risks associated with the genderm acquisition  reliance upon third party manufacturers to produce certain key products  the ability to effectively manage a changing business  uncertainties related to pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement and the uncertainty of competitive forces within the pharmaceutical industry which affect both the market for its products and the availability of product lines for acquisitions which meet the company s acquisition criteria 
the future results of operations  both annually and from quarter to quarter  are subject to a variety of factors applicable to the company and to the industries and markets in which it operates 
to enable medicis to focus on its core marketing and sales activities  the company selectively out sources certain non sales and non marketing functions  such as laboratory research  manufacturing and warehousing 
as the company expands its activities in these areas  additional financial resources are expected to be utilized 
the company typically does not enter into long term manufacturing contracts with third party manufacturers 
whether or not such contracts exist  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain adequate supplies of its products in a timely fashion  on acceptable terms  or at all

inflation did not have a significant impact upon the results of the company during fiscal  or the year issue results from the inability of some computer programs to identify the year properly  potentially leading to errors or system failure 
a company s business may be adversely affected if it  or any of its suppliers and customers or others with whom it transacts business including its banks and governmental agencies  have not timely resolved the year issue 
in response to its rapid growth  the company selected a new management information system in fiscal  which was implemented in fiscal that is expected to meet its presently anticipated needs 
in selecting a system  year compliance was one of the criteria 
the company is reviewing the areas within its business and operations which could be adversely affected by year issues and evaluating the costs associated with modifying and testing its systems for the year although the company is not yet able to estimate its incremental cost for the year issues  within its internal information systems  based on its preliminary review to date  the company does not believe year issues  will have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is currently working with critical third parties to determine the impact of year issues on their business and operations and its collateral impact on the business and operations of the company and plans to remediate year issues where their systems interface with the company s systems

dependence on acquisition strategy and new product introductions the company s strategy for growth is substantially dependent upon its continued ability to acquire products targeted at the dermatology market 
the company engages in limited proprietary research and development of new products and must rely upon the willingness of other companies to sell or license product lines 
other companies  including those with substantially greater financial  marketing and sales resources  compete with the company to acquire such products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to acquire rights to additional products on acceptable terms  or at all 
the failure of the company to acquire additional products or successfully introduce new products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  any new internally developed or acquired products may have different distribution channels and may face different pricing pressures and levels of competition than the company s current products 
consequently  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete favorably and attain market acceptance in any new product category or successfully integrate any acquired products or businesses 
in addition  any such products may require the company to significantly increase its sales force and incur commensurate expenses in anticipation of a new product introduction

prior to the acquisition  the company did not market any products in the topical acne rosacea treatment  anti itch medication  topical analgesic or wart treatment markets  and the company has no experience marketing such products 
successful integration of these products by the company is important to maintaining growth of sales of these products 
the historical net sales of genderm  prior to its acquisition by medicis  are based upon genderm s sales practices which the company believes may have included discounts and sales incentives to increase genderm s sales above historic consumption levels 
due to these selling practices  there can be no assurance that the company can attain similar sales levels of the genderm products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully integrate  market and sell the products acquired from genderm  or that such products will be accepted by the market at levels previously achieved by genderm  or sufficient to maintain growth 
the failure of the company to successfully integrate  market and sell these products would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the acquisition involves a number of risks that could adversely affect the company s operating results  including the assumption of liabilities and obligations of genderm  including the liabilities and obligations which may not have been adequately disclosed to the company  the diversion of management s attention  and the assimilation of the acquired operations into the company s business  and the valuation of acquired intangible assets 
the agreement governing the terms of the acquisition limits the company s remedies for any losses incurred by the company in connection with the acquisition to the indemnification rights specifically provided to the company under the agreement governing the acquisition

in addition  the company s other products  including the otc and cosmetic dermatology products  also compete with various brands and private label products  as well as with compounds which some dermatologists formulate themselves in small quantities for their patients 
several of the company s products  including dynacin r and lidex r  compete with generic non branded pharmaceuticals which claim to offer equivalent therapeutic benefits at a lower cost 
in some cases  insurers and other third party payors seek to encourage the use of generic products by making branded products less attractive  from a cost perspective  to buyers 
in addition  certain of the company s otc products  including zostrix r  compete with private label products 
the aggressive pricing activities of the company s generic and private label competitors and the payment and reimbursement policies of third party payors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

whether or not such contracts exist  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain adequate supplies of its products in a timely fashion  on acceptable terms  or at all 
the company s dynacin r products are manufactured solely by schein in compliance with the company s specifications and quality standards pursuant to a supply agreement 
under the agreement  schein manufactures minocycline for sale in the branded market exclusively for the company  but may manufacture and sell minocycline for itself or others as a generic product 
schein currently manufactures minocycline for the generic market under its own label 
the supply agreement expires in december  but is subject to automatic renewal for successive two year periods if neither party gives timely notice of termination 
it may also be terminated by either party without cause upon months notice 
schein may terminate the exclusivity portion of the agreement if its gross profit on sales of dynacin r products falls below a specified level 
the agreement also provides that the company will purchase all of its requirements for minocycline from schein but may purchase some of its requirements from another manufacturer if schein fails to meet certain cost standards or fails to provide the company with all of its requirements for two of four consecutive quarters 
either party may terminate the agreement in the event that the other party cannot perform under the agreement for a period of three months or longer for certain reasons beyond its control 
the inability of schein to fulfill the company s supply requirements for dynacin r  one of the company s largest selling products  in a timely fashion would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the majority of the company s lidex r products are manufactured by patheon in accordance with a manufacturing and supply agreement

there can be no assurance that the manufacturers of the company s products will continue to meet the fda s regulations or the company s product specifications and standards for the indicated products or that they can continue to meet product demand on a consistent and timely basis 
certain of the company s products  including the dynacin r products  are manufactured by a sole manufacturer 
because of the fda requirement for cgmp validation of manufacturing facilities for particular products  validation of a new facility to serve as a replacement source of manufacturing requires a substantial period of time 
any loss of a manufacturer or any difficulty relating to the manufacturing of the company s products  especially the key products  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the company faces the risk that  upon expiration of the term of any third party manufacturing agreement  it may not be able to renew or extend the agreement with the third party manufacturer  to obtain an alternative manufacturing source from other third parties or to develop internal manufacturing capabilities on commercially viable terms  if at all 
the company has obtained business interruption insurance against the loss of income for up to months due to the interruption of manufacturing of the company s key products due to certain causes 
there can be no assurance that the policy will cover all manufacturing interruptions or that the amount of such insurance will be adequate to fully protect the company for losses associated with such interruptions

the company s third party manufacturers rely on certain suppliers of key raw materials 
certain of those materials are purchased from single sources and others may be purchased from single sources in the future 
any disruption in supplies  including delays due to the inability of the company or its manufacturers to procure raw materials  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
to manage its resources effectively  the company attempts to maintain inventory levels that are no greater than necessary to meet the currently projected needs of its customers

uncertainty of product development the company has developed and obtained rights to certain pharmaceutical agents in various stages of development 
the company has a variety of products under development  ranging from existing product line extensions to new products to reformulations of existing products 
all products and technologies under development require significant commitment of personnel and financial resources 
several products require extensive clinical evaluation and premarketing clearance by the fda and comparable agencies in other countries prior to commercial sale 
there can be no assurance that any of these products under development will be successfully introduced 
certain of the products and technologies under development have been licensed from third parties 
the failure of the company to meet its obligations under one or more of these agreements could result in the termination of the company s rights under such agreements 
in addition  the company regularly reevaluates its product development efforts 
on the basis of these reevaluations  the company has in the past  and may in the future  abandon development efforts for particular products 
there can be no assurance that any product or technology under development will result in the successful introduction of any new product 
the failure to introduce new products into the market on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item business products in development and government regulation 
the company has in the past supplemented  and may in the future supplement  its research and development efforts by entering into research and development agreements with other pharmaceutical companies in order to defray the cost of product development

uncertainty of government regulation the manufacture and sale of cosmetics and drugs is subject to regulation principally by the fda and state and local authorities in the united states  and by comparable agencies in certain foreign countries 
the federal trade commission ftc and state and local authorities regulate the advertising of otc drugs and cosmetics 
the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  as amended the food and drug act  and the regulations promulgated thereunder  and other federal and state statutes and regulations  govern  among other things  the testing  manufacture  safety  effectiveness  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval  advertising and promotion of the company s products 
in general  products falling within the fda s definition of new drugs require premarketing clearance by the fda 
products falling within the fda s definition of cosmetics or of drugs that are not new drugs and that are generally recognized as safe and effective do not require premarketing clearance 
in general  fda approval is required before a new drug product may be marketed in the united states 
however  most otc drugs are exempt from the fda s premarketing approval requirements 
the fda issues monographs that set forth the specific active ingredients  dosages  indications and labeling statements for otc drug ingredients that the fda will consider generally recognized as safe and effective and  therefore  not subject to pre market approval 
otc drug ingredients are classified by the fda in one of three categories category i ingredients  which are deemed safe and effective for otc use  category ii ingredients  which are deemed not generally recognized as safe and effective for otc use  and category iii ingredients  which are deemed possibly safe and effective with studies ongoing 
based upon the results of these ongoing studies  the fda may reclassify all category iii ingredients as category i or category ii ingredients 
otc drug manufacturing facilities are subject to fda inspection  and failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may lead to administrative or judicially imposed penalties 
the active ingredient in dynacin r products  minocycline  and the active ingredient in lidex r  fluocinonide  have been approved by the fda under an nda 
the active ingredient in zostrix r  capsaicin  is classified currently by the fda as a category i ingredient 
the active ingredient in triaz r products has been classified as a category iii ingredient under a tentative final fda monograph for otc use in treatment of labeled conditions 
the fda has requested  and a task force of the ndma  a trade association of otc drug manufacturers  has undertaken further studies to confirm that benzoyl peroxide  an active ingredient in triaz r products  is not a tumor promoter when tested in conjunction with uv light exposure 
triaz r products  which the company sells on a prescription basis  have the same ingredients at the same dosage levels as the otc products 
when the fda issues the final monograph  the company may be required by the fda to sell triaz r as an otc drug unless the company files an nda covering such product 
in addition  there can be no assurance as to the results of these studies or any fda action to reclassify benzoyl peroxide 
in addition  there can be no assurance that adverse test results would not result in withdrawal of triaz r from the market 
an adverse decision by the fda with respect to the safety of benzoyl peroxide could result in the assertion of product liability claims against the company and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes that certain of its products  as they are promoted and intended by the company for use  are exempt from being considered new drugs based on the date of introduction of their active ingredients and therefore do not require pre marketing clearance 
there can be no assurance that the fda will not take a contrary position 
if the fda were to do so  the company may be required to seek fda approval for such products  market such products as otc products  or withdraw such products from the market 
the company believes that such products are subject to regulations governing product safety  use of ingredients  labeling and promotion  and methods of manufacture 
clinical trials and the marketing and manufacturing of pharmaceutical products are subject to the rigorous testing and approval processes of the fda and foreign regulatory authorities 
the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals is lengthy and expensive 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain the necessary approvals to conduct clinical trials or to manufacture and market such products  that all necessary clearances will be granted to the company or its licensors for future products on a timely basis  or at all  or that fda review or other actions will not cause delays adversely affecting the marketing and sale of the company s products 
in addition  the testing and approval process with respect to certain new products which the company may develop or seek to introduce is likely to take a substantial number of years and involve the expenditure of substantial resources 
there can be no assurance that pharmaceutical products currently in development  or those products acquired or licensed by the company  will be cleared for marketing by the fda 
failure to obtain any necessary approvals or failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  future government regulation could prevent or delay regulatory approval of the company s products 
there can be no assurance that any approval will be granted on a timely basis  or at all  that the fda will not require post marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the product and continued compliance with regulatory requirements  that the fda will not require the submission of any lot of any product for inspection and will not restrict the release of any lot that does not comply with fda standards  that the fda will not otherwise order the suspension of manufacturing  recall or seizure of products  or that the fda will not withdraw its marketing clearance of any product if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product are discovered following approval 
from time to time  the fda has issued correspondence to pharmaceutical companies  including the company  alleging that their advertising or promotional practices are false  misleading or deceptive 
there can be no assurance that the company will not receive such correspondence from the fda in the future  or that  if such notices are received  they will not result in substantial cost or disruption  including fines and penalties  material changes to the manner in which the company promotes its products  loss of sales of the company s products or other material adverse effects on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
for both currently marketed and future products  failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements could  among other things  result in fines  suspensions of regulatory approvals  product recalls  operating restrictions  criminal prosecution  relabeling costs  delays in product distribution  marketing and sales  or seizure or cessation of manufacture of the products and the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions 
there can be no assurance that the fda will not change its position with regard to the safety or effectiveness of the company s current or future products or that the fda will agree with the company s position regarding the regulatory status of its products 
in the event that the fda takes a contrary position regarding any of the company s current or future products  the company may be required to change its labeling or formulation or cease the manufacture and marketing of such products 
in addition  even prior to any formal regulatory action  the company could decide voluntarily to cease distribution and sale or to recall any of its products if concern about the safety or efficacy of any of its products were to develop 
any such action could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company also will be subject to foreign regulatory authorities governing clinical trials and pharmaceutical sales if it seeks to market its products outside the united states 
whether or not fda approval has been obtained  approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing of the product in those countries 
the approval process varies from country to country and the time required may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 
there can be no assurance that any foreign regulatory agency will approve any product submitted for review by the company 
see item business government regulation 
uncertainty of enforceability of trademarks  patents and proprietary rights the company believes that trademark and service mark protection is an important factor in establishing product recognition 
there can be no assurance that any such trademarks or service mark registrations will afford the company adequate protection  or that the company will have the financial resources to enforce its rights under any such trademarks or service mark registrations 
the inability of the company to protect its trademarks or service marks from infringement could result in impairment to any goodwill which may be developed in such trademarks and service marks 
moreover  the company s inability to use one or more of its trademarks or service marks because of successful third party claims could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time  the company receives communications from parties who allege that their interests may be damaged either by the company s use of a particular trademark or service mark or its registration of such trademark or service mark 
there can be no assurance that such oppositions will not be filed or that  if filed  they will not have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is pursuing several united states patent applications 
there can be no assurance that patents will be issued with respect to any of these applications 
the company has acquired rights under certain patents and patent applications from third party licensors 
the company has also acquired from certain of its consultants and principals an assignment of their rights to certain united states patents or patent applications 
certain of such patents and patent applications may be subject to claims of rights by third parties  by reason of existing relationships with the party who filed such patents or patent applications 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain any rights under such patents or patent applications as a result of any such conflicting claims  or that any rights which the company may obtain will be sufficient for the company to market products that may be the subject of such patents or patent applications 
the company believes that its success will depend in part on its ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for its own inventions  and to obtain and maintain licenses for the use of patents  licensed or sublicensed  by third parties 
there can be no assurance that any patent issued to  or licensed by  the company will provide protection that has commercial significance 
in this regard  the patent position of pharmaceutical compounds is particularly uncertain 
there can be no assurance that challenges will be not be instituted against the validity or enforceability of any patent owned by or licensed to the company or  if instituted  that such challenges will not be successful 
the cost of litigation to uphold the validity and prevent infringement of patents can be substantial and such litigation can require a substantial commitment of management s time 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar technologies or duplicate the technology owned by or licensed to the company or design around the patented aspects of such technology 
the company only conducts complete searches to determine whether its products infringe upon any existing patents as it deems appropriate 
there can be no assurance that the products and technologies the company currently markets  or may seek to market in the future  will not infringe patents or other rights owned by others 
in the event of an adverse outcome of any dispute with respect to patents or other rights  the company may be required to license such disputed rights or to cease sales of the affected products or modify those products to avoid infringement of those rights 
there can be no assurance that a license would be available on terms acceptable to the company  or at all 
the company relies and expects to continue to rely upon unpatented proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation in the development and manufacture of many of its principal products 
the company s policy is to require all its employees  consultants  and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements with the company 
there can be no assurance  however  that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for the company s trade secrets or proprietary know how in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure of such know how 
in addition  there can be no assurance that others will not obtain access to or independently develop similar or equivalent trade secrets or know how

customer concentration  consolidation of distribution network the distribution network for pharmaceutical products has  in recent years  been subject to increasing consolidation 
as a result  a few very large wholesale distributors control a significant share of the market 
in addition  the number of independent drug stores and small chains has decreased as retail consolidation has occurred 
further consolidation among  or any financial difficulties of  distributors or retailers could result in the combination or elimination of warehouses which may result in product returns to the company  cause a reduction in the inventory levels of distributors or retailers  or otherwise reduce purchases of the company s products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
medicis customers include the leading wholesale pharmaceutical distributors in the united states  such as mckesson  bergen brunswig  cardinal  bindley and other major drug chains 
in fiscal  mckesson  bergen brunswig  and cardinal accounted for approximately  and  respectively of the company s sales

uncertainties relating to pharmaceutical pricing  third party reimbursement and health care reform the operating results of the company will depend in part on the availability of adequate reimbursement for the company s products from third party payors  such as government entities  private health insurers and managed care organizations 
third party payors are increasingly seeking to negotiate the pricing of medical services and products and to promote the use of generic  non branded pharmaceuticals through payor based reimbursement policies designed to encourage their use 
in some cases  third party payors will pay or reimburse a user or supplier of a prescription drug product for only a portion of the purchase price of the product 
in the case of the company s prescription products  payment or reimbursement by third party payors of only a portion of the cost of such products could make such products less attractive  from a cost perspective  to users  suppliers and prescribing physicians 
there can be no assurance that reimbursement  if available  will be adequate 
moreover  certain of the company s products are not of a type generally eligible for third party reimbursement 
if adequate reimbursement levels are not provided by government entities or other third party payors for the company s products  or if those reimbursement policies increasingly favor the use of generic products  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  managed care initiatives to control costs have influenced primary care physicians to refer fewer patients to dermatologists  resulting in a declining target market for the company 
further reductions in referrals to dermatologists would have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operation 
in addition  a number of legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at changing the united states health care system have been proposed in recent years 
while the company cannot predict whether any such proposals will be adopted  or the effect that any such proposal may have on its business  such proposals  if enacted  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

potential product liability  limited insurance coverage the company faces an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of its products is alleged to have resulted in adverse effects 
such risk exists even with respect to those products that are manufactured in licensed and regulated facilities or that otherwise have received regulatory approval for commercial sale 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be subject to significant product liability claims 
the company currently has product liability insurance in the amount of million per claim and million in the aggregate on a claims made basis 
many of the company s customers require the company to maintain product liability insurance as a condition to their conducting business with the company 
there can be no assurance that insurance coverage will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  that such insurance will be adequate to cover potential product liability claims  or that a loss of insurance coverage or the assertion of a product liability claim or claims would not materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item business government regulation and product liability insurance 
dependence on licenses from others the company has acquired rights to manufacture  use or market certain of its products  including certain of its key products  as well as many of its other proposed products and technologies  pursuant to license agreements with third parties 
such agreements contain provisions requiring the company to use its best efforts or otherwise exercise diligence in pursuing market development for such products in order to maintain the rights granted under the agreements and may be canceled upon the company s failure to perform its payment or other obligations 
there can be no assurance that the company will fulfill its obligations under one or more of such agreements due to insufficient resources  lack of successful product development  lack of product acceptance or other reasons 
the failure to satisfy the requirements of any such agreements may result in the loss of the company s rights under that agreement or under related agreements 
the inability of the company to continue to license these products or to license other necessary products for use with its products or substantial increases in royalty payments under third party licenses could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the effective implementation of the company s strategy depends on the successful integration of these licensed products with the company s products  and therefore any flaws or limitations of such licensed products may impair the company s ability to market and sell its products  delay new product introductions  and or adversely affect the company s reputation 
such problems could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s license agreement with dr 
joel bernstein for the exclusive rights to market the zostrix r product line will terminate in june with the expiration of the related patent 
the license agreement for certain of the company s other products will also terminate upon the expiration of any such underlying patents

risk of product recall and product returns product recalls may be issued at the discretion of the company  the fda or other government agencies having regulatory authority for product sales and may occur due to disputed labeling claims  manufacturing issues  quality defects or other reasons 
there can be no assurance that product recalls will not occur in the future 
any product recall  especially one of the company s key products  could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s policy is to accept for return only damaged or out of date products 
however  the company s customers have in the past sought  and may in the future seek  exceptions to that policy 
there can be no assurance that the company will not grant such exceptions in the future 
the company maintains financial reserves for the anticipated amount of product returns based upon historical experience 
there can be no assurance that future recalls or returns would not exceed reserves or otherwise have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on key personnel the company is dependent on certain management personnel for the operation and development of its business 
the company has entered into an employment agreement providing for full time services with mr 
jonah shacknai  the founder  chairman of the board and chief executive officer of the company 
the current term of the employment agreement expires on june   subject to automatic renewal for periods of five years unless either party gives timely notice of an intention not to renew the employment agreement 
mr

in addition  the company is dependent upon its scientific consultants  particularly with respect to the commercial development of discoveries and technologies as to which they have special expertise 
certain of such consultants are employed on a full time basis by employers other than the company  and some have consulting or other advisory arrangements with other entities which may conflict with their obligations to the company 
the loss of any key person  or a reduction in the amount of time mr 
shacknai devotes to the company  could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
uncertainty of access to capital the company may need to raise additional funds to acquire or license additional formulations  technologies  products or businesses  to expand its sales force  to support the marketing and sales of additional products  and possibly to expand its facilities to accommodate an expanded sales force or to expand manufacturing capabilities and capacity 
the company may seek additional funding through public and private financings  including equity financings 
adequate funds for these purposes  whether through the financial markets or from other sources  may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to the company 
insufficient funds may cause the company to delay  scale back  or abandon some or all of its acquisition and licensing opportunities  marketing  research and product development programs and manufacturing opportunities

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is defined as the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market valuation which arise from equity price risk  interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk  and commodity price risk 
the company s primary market risk is equity price risk 
interest rate risk the company faces minimal interest rate risk exposure in relation to its outstanding debt of  at june  a hypothetical percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the debt would not have a material impact on earnings or cash flows of the company 
currency risk the company faces transactional currency exposures that arise when its canadian subsidiary or the company itself enters into transactions denominated in the canadian dollar 
the company also faces currency risk exposure that arises from translating the results of its canada operations to the us dollar 
the currency risk exposure is not material as the canadian subsidiary s operations do not have a material impact on the company s earnings 
commodity price risk the company does not take commodity risk 
equity price risk the company maintains a portfolio of available for sale securities which subjects the company to equity pricing risks 
the change in fair values of equity securities represents instantaneous changes in all equity prices 
the following are changes in the fair value of the company s available for sale securities at june  based on hypothetical percentage changes in fair value 
equity price risk is managed through industry diversification 
actual future price appreciation or depreciation may be different from the changes identified in the table below
