item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following comments should be read in conjunction with accompanying financial statements 
productivity of assets and working capital 
a assets 
um s year ending total assets increased by million relative to the end of as a result of the mid year acquisition of columbia medical  inc cmi 
year ending assets attributable to cmi were about million including working capital  net after accumulated depreciation property and equipment  and net after accumulated amortization intangible assets of about million  million and million  respectively 
um s total asset turns ratio of sales to total assets declined in because average total assets declined only  while sales decreased  both relative to total asset productivity is important as a factor to help maintain return on shareholders equity roe at levels which will finance significant future growth 
total asset turns of were below management s targeted long term turn rate of although total year ending net property  plant and equipment assets pp e remained about the same as at year end  pp e in utah and ireland decreased million and million  respectively  to offset the million increase by the cmi acquisition 
the decreases resulted from the fact that in utah depreciation of assets already in service exceeded purchases of new or replacement pp e assets  and in ireland from currency translation adjustments decreasing the us dollar value of those assets 
since um has in place the physical plant to support significant growth without major capital investment  the trend of depreciation exceeding new pp e purchases should continue in for the businesses in which um currently participates 
working capital declined by million because of the changes in um s business  including the cmi acquisition  but um s current ratio improved to cash and investments declined million as a result of tying um s daily cash receipts and disbursements directly into its line of credit  in order to minimize the credit line balance 
inventories increased by million  about two thirds of which came from the cmi acquisition 
the remaining inventory increase was significant in light of the substantial decrease in business activity 
after the termination of the baxter agreement  um honored longer term purchase commitments with its vendors and sought to smooth the decline in its workforce 
as a result  year ending average inventory turns declined to times 
in  the company plans to reduce its inventories substantially while increasing sales activity 
year ending accounts receivable a r balances increased million relative to the end of  and  at an average aging of days based on q shipment activity  remained within management s aging target 
a r over days from invoice date were less than of total a r 
as um continues to increase the share of its business invoiced directly to end users  particularly hospitals  in contrast to distributors or oem s  maintaining a r at current aging levels will become increasingly difficult 
in  the planned reduction in inventory by itself should be sufficient to finance the increase in a r resulting from increased sales activity 
b liabilities 
current liabilities c l at year end were down from the prior year end  excluding the reserve for litigation expenses 
this reflects lower sales activity in q relative to q  and also lower raw material purchasing activity at the end of as a result of inventory reduction programs 
the litigation reserve is an accumulated accrual against the company s income performance  anticipating the costs of future product liability lawsuits  patent infringement litigation and other litigation that is an inherent consequence of doing business in our society 
the reserve increased million in because um accrued that much more against its performance than it experienced in actual litigation expenses 
management believes that the current accrual rate plus the  reserve balance will be sufficient to fund known pending or planned litigation 
um established a credit line in the form of a long term revolving promissory note with its bank on april  under the note  the company may borrow up to million at a floating interest rate tied to libor or the prime rate at um s election 
amounts borrowed under the note are unsecured 
the note terminates on march  at march   the balance on the note is about million at a current interest rate of approximately per annum 
other than the credit line  um has no long term debt obligations 
um s total debt ratio including both current and long term liabilities as a percentage of total assets at the end of was 
results of operations 
a revenues 
in as a whole  revenues were down from the decline in business with baxter represented of the decline 
in the first half h of  sales were down relative to the h for the h  sales were down from the h the decline in baxter revenues represented of the h decline 
um divides revenues into three categories obstetrics  comprised of a full line of equipment and supplies used in hospitals labor delivery departments for fetal monitoring  operative vacuum delivery  umbilical cord management  and meconium aspiration  as well as other needs  gynecology urology electrosurgery es equipment and tools used especially for a gynecologic electrosurgical procedure called letzr  but also other electrosurgical procedures including endoscopic procedures  and other non gynecological procedures such as tonsillectomies by otolaryngologists  abdominal reconstructions and breast reductions by plastic surgeons  mammary artery grafts by thoracic surgeons  nevus excision by dermatologists  and tumor excisions by all surgeons  other tools used in other minimally invasive surgical procedures including diagnostic laparoscopies  urinary incontinence management devices  and urology pumps  and disposable components used in critical care applications  especially invasive blood pressure and icp monitoring  but also disposable respiratory products 
revenues from contract molding are also included in this critical care revenue category 
um achieves critical marketing mass through innovation in developing and commercializing proprietary products that become the most recognized cost effective solution for certain clinical needs 
um s primary revenue contributors generally enjoy a dominant market share and have important product features protected by patents 
in obstetrics  the company owns eight fetal monitoring patents with two others pending  five vacuum extraction patents and four umbilical cord management patents 
in gynecology urology es  the company owns four patents with four others pending 
in critical care applications  the company owns patents  several of which are licensed to other medical companies 
sales of obstetrics products in were  compared to  in  and  in in  obstetrics product revenues declined million relative to due to two competitors taking a lower pricing strategy against intran  with new products um believes are infringing the company s patents 
in h  the intran sales decline was amplified by depletion of inventory by terminated distributors and um repurchases of distributor inventory 
in  sales of intran represented of obstetrics sales  compared to in in the h  due to the acquisition of cmi  sales of intran represented of obstetrics sales 
also  beginning in q  um introduced several versions of intran plus designed to address user preferences in tip size  zero switch location and amniotic fluid visualization 
obstetrics product sales in h were million  compared to million in h as a percentage of total um sales  obstetrics product revenues represented in compared to in gynecology urology es product sales were  in compared to  in and  in several new products aided the growth in including epitome  a unique es scalpel  liberty  a conservative therapy for female urinary incontinence  pathfinder plus  an irrigation device for endoscopic procedures  and cmi s urology pumps 
in  this category of revenues represented of total um sales compared to in in contrast to um s other two product categories  a number of the products in this category are designed for use in physicians offices or outpatient clinics  and therefore represent important diversification for um s business 
critical care revenues were  in compared to  in and  in included in this category are transducers and other components used in blood pressure monitoring sold to baxter  which sales in were  compared to  in and  in the decline in sales to baxter represented of the decline from critical care sales  and of the decline from critical care sales 
the silver lining in this cloud is the fact that um no longer has one customer that represents more than of its total sales 
sales to baxter  still the largest um customer  represented of um s total sales in because of um s automated assembly capabilities  and established overseas customer base  management expects to be able to sustain a reasonable base of business for its critical care products that will continue to contribute to um s profitability 
um divides its distribution channels into direct and oem channels 
direct sales are sales of um s products by its own employed sales representatives  by independent commissioned representatives  or by stocking distributors in a particular geographic region 
increasing direct sales are an indication of the company s ability to build its own marketing franchise 
oem sales are sales of um products by other medical device manufacturers either as a component of a kit  or as a repackaged stand alone product into markets not served by um s own direct sales resources 
in  global direct sales represented about of total sales compared to about in  and in in the us  direct sales represented of sales in compared to in and in by product line category  dividing global sales into the two distribution channels of direct and oem  yields the following obstetrics  direct and oem in  and direct in both and  gynecology urology es  direct and oem in  direct and oem in  and direct and oem in  and critical care  direct and oem in  direct and oem in  and direct and oem in sales to baxter are part of critical care oem sales 
previous years foreign sales included a substantial portion to baxter divisions overseas 
including baxter sales  foreign sales were  in  compared to  in and  in excluding baxter sales  foreign sales were  in  compared to  in and  in foreign sales comprised of total non baxter sales in  compared to in and in excluding sales to baxter  critical care products represented of foreign sales in compared to in and in in  um sales should increase due to having the benefit of cmi sales for the entire year compared to one half year in um intends to continue marketing programs to expand sales of its newer products epitome  liberty  cordguard  and filtresse  as well as introduce other ob gyn niche products currently in development and  if affordable  acquire synergistic products from other companies 
um continues to believe it has substantial sales potential for its existing products in international markets  and therefore plans to continue to commit resources for international business expansion 
b gross profits 
gross profit margins profit after subtracting costs of manufacturing products from revenues in were compared to in and in the improvement in average gross profit margin was achieved from changes in the product mix and distribution mix 
in terms of product mix  sales of um s ob gyn products increased to of total sales in from of total sales in  and of sales in in terms of distribution mix  sales in the us by the company s directly employed representatives increased to about of total domestic direct sales in  compared to in and about in the distribution mix change is a result of terminating stocking distributors  and replacing them with employed sales representatives 
average selling prices increase because fewer products are sold to distributors at a discount  and therefore gross margins increase as long as manufacturing costs do not increase in the same proportion 
working against gross margin improvements in was the fact that manufacturing overhead manufacturing costs excluding the costs of direct materials and direct labor  eg depreciation of pp e  utilities  engineering  qa and supervision were not reduced in proportion to the decline in sales 
if um had reduced manufacturing overhead costs in proportion to its decline in sales  that is  had manufacturing overhead expenses as a percentage of sales remained at and levels  average gross margins for would have been 
um has improved its gross margins as a percentage of sales every year for the last twelve years 
additional gross margin improvements can be achieved if um can increase sales activity to better absorb its overhead expenses 
on the other hand  management expects continued competitive pressure for its established products that may reduce average selling prices and therefore put additional pressure on gross margins in c operating profits 
operating profits  or income from operations  are the profits achieved after subtracting operating expenses from gross profits 
operating profits in were  compared to  in and  in even though gross margins were up as a percentage of sales  operating profits were down compared to sales down 
um did not decrease operating expenses in proportion to the sales decline in because of management s belief that certain spending levels were necessary to increase revenues in future years 
although expenses in dollars decreased by million relative to and by million relative to  operating expenses increased to as a percentage of revenues in compared to of revenues in and of revenues in operating expenses are subdivided into sales  general and administrative expenses sg a and research and development expenses r d 
um further divides sg a into the two categories of sales and marketing expenses s m and general and administrative expenses g a 
sg a expenses in increased to of revenues compared to in and in there were three primary causes for the substantial increase in sg a expenses as a percentage of sales a substantial increase in the proportion of um s business that is direct versus oem  combined with the distribution mix change from distributors to directly employed representatives in um s direct portion of its business  amortization of goodwill associated with the july cmi acquisition  and spreading relatively fixed expenses over fewer revenue dollars  for example  spending on new product marketing programs  outside legal and accounting fees  and costs associated with being a publicly traded company  among others 
because of the first two fundamental changes to um s business expenses  management expects future sg a expenses as a percentage of sales to remain closer to the rate than the earlier and rates  even as sales volume increases 
um s s m expenses are driven primarily by the direct sales portion of its business 
although um desires to increase its oem customers  particularly for its blood pressure monitoring products and other products which serve markets that are outside um s sales focus  management expects that the direct portion of um s business will grow faster than the oem portion  which represented about of total sales in the distribution mix changes that had a positive impact on gross margins in had a negative effect on selling expenses 
in  um increased its direct sales force headcount by 
management believes that achieving closer contact with end users of its specialty products  as well as having closer control of how its sales resources spend limited time  are key elements to implementing its value added niche marketing strategies 
in  um has terminated an additional distributor  which should yield sales to stocking distributors as a percentage of total direct us sales less than in although g a expenses declined million in relative to  they did so under greater requirements 
included in the g a expenses were amortization of goodwill related to the cmi acquisition of  plus other g a expenses in ireland and oregon of million that were not present in in  um plans to hold its g a dollar expenses in utah and ireland consistent with  but the addition of g a expenses related to cmi for a whole year added together with amortization of goodwill at an annual rate of about  will result in g a expenses as a percentage of sales approximately the same in as in r d expenses were of sales in compared to of sales in and of sales in um s consistent investment of about of annual sales in r d has yielded twenty one k premarketing submissions to the fda over the last five years  a reasonable indicator of new product development efforts 
in  um submitted four new k applications to the fda 
in addition  um has filed or acquired twenty product patent applications over the last five years  including nine in the company employs specialist r d resources not only to internally develop its own new product ideas  but also  through joint development agreements  licensing of technology  acquisitions and other arrangements  to enhance and complete to commercialization projects initiated by others 
for example  um began working in cooperation with mayo clinic in may to develop and commercialize an advanced endometrial tissue sampling approach designed by r 
stuart fowler  md  mayo clinic  scottsdale  arizona 
um expects to maintain its commitment to r d in consistent with the past as a percentage of sales 
d non operating income 
non operating income includes royalties from licensing um s technology to other companies  interest and capital gains from investing the company s cash offset by interest on um s debt obligations  and gains or losses from the sale of assets 
non operating income of million made a substantial contribution to performance 
non operating income in represented about of pretax income  compared to in and in non operating income in was about million less than because of an extraordinary payment in relating to the use of um s technology 
non operating income in was slightly higher than in items in which were different from recent prior years included interest expense of  from um s use of a credit line to finance the purchase of cmi  and a  gain from the sale of a small property in lehi  utah 
royalties from other medical device companies continue to constitute a majority of the non operating income 
royalties received vary from year to year depending on the interest in um s patents and or success of other companies in selling licensed product concepts 
barring new technology licensing or other extraordinary transactions  um s management estimates that non operating income in will be lower than in  due primarily to continued interest expense on debt balances and no anticipated sales of property similar to e earnings before income taxes 
earnings before income taxes ebt result from adding um s non operating income to its operating profits 
ebt  as a percentage of sales  were in compared to and in and  respectively 
despite much lower sales volume  um was able to maintain very high before tax profitability when compared with other publicly traded companies performance 
continued gross margin improvements  tight controls on operating expenses and excellent non operating income were the keys 
except for the extraordinary year of  um s historical best year of profitability  the company achieved profitability consistent with previous years in terms of earnings before taxes as a percentage of sales in the range of f net income 
net income is ebt minus income taxes 
um s effective income tax rate was in compared to in and in um s effective rate includes federal and state income taxes in the us  as well as taxes overseas 
the increased tax rate in reflects the non deductibility of goodwill for tax purposes associated with the cmi acquisition  a difference in the distribution of state taxes  a smaller amount of non operating income coming from tax exempt securities  and other fluctuations associated with the use of a foreign sales corporation and r d tax credits 
the ireland operation did not generate enough profits at a lower income tax rate to help reduce the overall effective rate in net income of million in on million in sales ranks in the top profitability tier of us publicly traded companies 
um generates profits equivalent in magnitude to profitable companies three times its size in revenues 
net income in was  compared to  in and  in although an unfavorable comparison  the two years of and were by far the most profitable in um s history  together representing one half of the cumulative profits generated over um s prior years of business 
as further perspective  in the four years of  um generated million in net profits in comparison to million generated in the fourteen years of management believes net profits will grow in g earnings per share eps 
eps is net income divided by the number of shares of stock outstanding diluted to take effect for stock options awarded which have exercise prices below the current market value 
diluted eps for were 
compared to 
for and 
for ending weighted average common shares in assuming dilution the number used to calculate diluted eps were  compared to  and  shares in and  respectively 
actual outstanding common shares as of december  were  the dilution calculation added about  shares to basic shares outstanding in  compared to about  in and  in h return on shareholders equity roe 
roe is the portion of net income retained by um to internally finance its growth  divided by average accumulated shareholders equity during the period 
this ratio determines how fast the company can afford to grow without external financing that would dilute shareholder interests 
for example  a roe will support growth in revenues 
roe in at was below management s target of 
the primary factor that lowered roe in was the low number of asset turns  that is  the level of sales activity relative to total assets was too low 
including  roe has averaged over the last twelve years 
cash flows and capital resources 
a cash flows 
ebdit ebt  adjusted for non cash depreciation and amortization expenses  asset write offs  and interest expense are the measure of um s ability to generate cash 
ebdit were million  or as a ratio of sales  
ebdit has averaged of sales over the last five years 
generating cash at a rate of one third of sales provides um with a powerful financial engine for growth 
the company obtained additional cash in through the use of its credit line  which as of the end of the year  provided an additional million in cash to facilitate the timing of the cmi acquisition 
cash and equivalent balances were million at the end of  a decrease of million from december  the two major uses of cash in were the cmi acquisition which used about million in cash after consolidating with cmi s cash accounts  and repurchases of um s stock in the amount of million 
the million for cmi was used for acquiring about million in non cash working capital inventories and receivables less payables  million in pp e primarily molds and molding presses  and million in intangible assets goodwill  acquisition fees  and patents 
net working capital changes excluding cmi used million  primarily as a reduction in current liabilities 
b capital expenditures 
in addition to the million in p e purchased as part of the cmi acquisition  um also spent another  in oregon to make communications and computer equipment compatible with utah 
um expended  in utah and  in ireland during for p e  including improvements and capitalized repairs to facilities  new and replacement furniture  manufacturing equipment and tooling required to sustain operations  as well as additional communications and computer equipment 
um realized  from the sale or disposal of p e assets in for reference  depreciation expense of p e in for cmi  utah and ireland was   and  respectively 
in addition to the million in intangible assets including goodwill purchased as part of the cmi acquisition  um expended million on the acquisition of patents and trademarks for potential new products 
for reference  amortization expense of intangibles in for cmi and for utah was  and  respectively 
excluding the possibility of additional acquisitions of new products  technology or marketing rights  um plans for capital expenditures in to be less than current depreciation rates 
c financing activities 
financing activities in netted a cash increase of  compared to using cash of  in and  in the company repurchased its own common stock during in the amount of  compared to  in and  in offsetting the repurchases  um received  from the issuance of  shares of stock due to exercises of employee options 
on april   um signed a long term revolving promissory note with its bank under which the company can borrow up to  at a floating interest rate tied to libor or the prime rate  at um s election 
amounts borrowed under the note are unsecured and are due march  the note provided  at year end management believes that future income from operations and effective management of its working capital assets will provide the liquidity needed to finance its internal growth plans 
in addition to capital expenditures supporting operations  um plans to use cash during the remainder of to reduce existing debt incurred in the acquisition of cmi 
additionally  the credit line may be used for liquidity for selective infusions of technological  marketing or product manufacturing rights or additional acquisitions to broaden the company s product offerings 
management s outlook 
although um s established business from prior years dramatically contracted in  management is looking forward to with renewed optimism 
the baxter dpt business has gone away 
the full financial impact of the change was realized as expected in on a positive note  um no longer has a huge dependence on one customer 
the balance of um s critical care product sales appear stable  particularly overseas where dpt sales increased by in compared to in  um will continue to recruit and support oem marketing partners in the us with the knowledge it can leverage its ability to cost effectively produce the commodity blood pressure monitoring dpts and other components without additional capital investments 
the more important loss in business  in terms of potential impact on long term success  resulted from the change in the competitive landscape with respect to um s core obstetrical iup product  intran 
performance in h demonstrated that intran sales volume lost has been essentially replaced with synergistic obstetrics products via the acquisition of cmi 
with the help of the cmi acquisition  um now offers the most complete line of supplies needed in labor delivery departments of hospitals 
in prior years  intran sales represented more than of um s ob gyn sales  representing a very high level of dependence on one product 
after the cmi acquisition  intran represented less than of um s ob gyn sales even though iupc sales in h were higher than h um s direct us sales team demonstrated its ability to communicate the value of reliability in h by successfully stopping further erosion of intran s dominant iupc market share by cheaper competing products 
knowledgeable physicians do not wish to increase their risk of a negative surprise in an inherently risky birthing procedure in order to save a few dollars 
ironically  experience has shown a higher cost from increased multiple insertions of new catheters of the cheaper products may result when readings appear inaccurate 
in  the sales team will continue to aggressively reinforce the superiority of the clinical benefits of um s intran plus  augmented by several new versions designed to address differences introduced by new competitors 
um believes these competitors are infringing its patents as alleged in pending litigation being pursued by um to protect its patented technology 
the intran options allow physician choices of tip size  zero button location and amniotic fluid visualization 
in addition  um expects greater activity in toward resolving um s claims of patent infringement against low priced competitors 
if the federal courts support um s position  the outcome will be significant monetary awards for um 
um s iupc patents have about eight years of life remaining 
um believes that the next generation of fetal monitoring should help physicians more clearly identify a sustained trend of decreasing fetal tissue ph indicating an increased risk of metabolic acidosis  the persistent physiologic condition most indicative of a fetus in trouble 
the corollary would be allowing a physician to recognize transitory respiratory low ph  or non decreasing ph in conjunction with a non reassuring fhr pattern  thereby allowing labor to continue without an unnecessary c section 
the clinical elegance of the um fetal ph measurement system in development adds a more timely fetal ph assessment into the same probe that currently measures fetal heart rate  the current standard of electronic fetal monitoring 
the optical chemistry between tissue and the probe is patented 
in  um will accelerate investment in this key project in order to overcome the remaining technical challenges  and begin human clinical trails to establish the safety and efficacy of the system 
the niche markets for which um s gynecology urology electrosurgery products are targeted have proven to require many and varied marketing initiatives 
in many cases  they require individual user training together with clear evidence of improved outcomes 
although sales of um s new products liberty and epitome increased by over relative to  growth in dollar terms remained modest 
in  um will continue to look for ways to increase the rate of adoption of its newer products  and for additional specific ob gyn clinical needs where innovations can become the most recognized cost effective solution 
the fowler endocurette for uterine biopsies is an example of such a device 
um plans to begin marketing the endocurette during after receiving fda premarketing concurrence 
um will continue to maintain a long term perspective and seek to strengthen its disease management focus with ob gyn physicians who it believes are ultimately responsible for their patients well being 
year compliance with respect to the potential impact of the turn of the century date change  um has reviewed the processing routines used in all its electronic products for any potential faults and has determined that all products are century date independent 
the date change at the beginning of the year will have no effect on the use or operation of um s products 
the software that um uses internally to control its business operations along with some equipment is not currently fully year compliant 
the company intends to have such software and equipment year compliant by late  and does not anticipate any interruptions to its business operations 
it is expected that costs associated with addressing this issue will not be material to um s business  operations or financial condition 
accounting policy changes the company has  during  adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 earnings per share 
accordingly  these statements  including historical information  present basic eps and diluted eps  instead of primary and fully diluted eps as previously required 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements presents further information regarding sfas no 
the company  during  adopted the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
accordingly  no compensation cost has been recognized in the financial statements 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements presents net income and earnings per share as if the fair value provisions of sfas no 
had been applied
