item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is a leading suppler of flexible interconnects principally for sale to the automotive  military aerospace  computer  telecommunications and industrial markets 
prior to  substantially all of the company s sales were for military aerospace applications 
beginning in  the company developed a business strategy of pursuing broader commercial applications for its products 
the execution of this strategy has resulted in a reduction of revenues from the military aerospace sector as a percentage of the company s total revenue from in fiscal year to in fiscal year  while increasing overall revenues approximately the company believes that its development of innovative materials and processes provides it with a competitive advantage in the markets in which it competes 
during the past three years  the company has invested over million or approximately of total revenues in research and development to develop materials and enhance its manufacturing processes 
the company includes in cost of products sold its expenditures for its research and development activities 
to better serve customers that have production facilities in asia and to more cost effectively manufacture certain products for worldwide distribution  the company formed a chinese joint venture  parlex shanghai circuit co  ltd  in the company owns of the equity interest in parlex shanghai 
accordingly  parlex shanghai s results of operations  cash flows and financial position are included in the company s consolidated financial statements see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in may  the company entered into an agreement to lease a facility in mexico to perform the finishing and  in some cases  assembly operations to parts being manufactured at its other production facilities 
the company anticipates that significant benefit will be realized from the performance of these labor intensive operations in mexico 
the start up costs did have a negative impact on the margins in the fourth quarter ended june   and an impact on margins is anticipated for the first quarter in the year that commenced july  the company is currently involved in an expansion program 
as a result of the follow on common stock offering completed in october  approximating million  the company now has sufficient resources to expand its methuen  massachusetts facility by an additional  square feet  of which  will be used for additional manufacturing capacity  with the remaining space to be used for administrative needs 
the company has also increased its manufacturing space at its production facilities in salem  new hampshire and shanghai  china 
the company has also invested in equipment that will increase its manufacturing capacity  and allow for the introduction of new technologies 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  selected items in the company s statements of income as a percentage of total revenues 
the table and the discussion below should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto year ended june  total revenues cost of products sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income income from operations before income taxes net income results of operations for the past three fiscal years total revenues total revenues rose to  in fiscal year  a increase from the  reported in fiscal  while revenues rose in fiscal from the  reported in fiscal year revenues grew in each of the company s principal product lines flexible circuits  laminated cable  flexible cable hybrid circuits and flexible interconnect assemblies 
the increase in total revenues in each year was primarily attributable to an increase in the volume of units shipped 
total revenues included licensing and royalty fees of   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
although the company intends to continue its practice of developing materials and processes that it can license to third parties  it does not expect that royalty revenues will represent a significant portion of total revenues in the near term 
cost of products sold cost of products sold in fiscal   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of products sold was   and in each of fiscal   and  respectively 
the improvement in the current fiscal year resulted from assigning production to the facility most economically suited to manufacture a particular type of product 
the decrease in the percentage in fiscal from fiscal was primarily the result of manufacturing yield improvements  particularly in connection with a major automotive program for motorola  while general productivity gains and increased absorption of overhead also contributed to the reduction 
these improvements were made possible by enhancements to the manufacturing process  the acquisition of additional production equipment and cost savings on materials and supplies 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
as a percentage of total revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses were   and in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the dollar increase in the past two fiscal years is primarily attributable to the opening of field offices in texas and san diego  hiring of additional sales personnel  additional commissions associated with incremental sales  and additional costs being incurred by the chinese joint venture 
the company anticipates that selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues will decrease as revenues increase 
other income other income of  this year is comprised  for the most part  of interest income  and  to a lesser extent  the gain on the sale of equipment  and items of a miscellaneous nature 
in  other income of  was principally the result of a gain on the sale of equipment  while the  in was comprised entirely of items of a miscellaneous nature 
interest expense interest expense was  this year versus  in fiscal the reduction in expense is attributable to a lower level of average borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility 
the increase in fiscal to  from  in was principally the result of increased borrowings to finance capital expenditures 
interest rates during the period remained relatively constant 
provision for taxes the company s effective tax rate in fiscal was versus and in fiscal years and  respectively 
this year the company benefited from the income generated by the chinese joint venture  which currently is not subject to tax 
items of a miscellaneous nature are attributed to the increase in from liquidity and capital resources in fiscal  the company had net income of million  as well as depreciation and amortization of million  thus adding million to cash flow 
cash flow was reduced by million relating to increased working capital  resulting in a positive cash flow from operations of million 
in october  the company completed a stock offering of  shares of its common stock  priced at per share 
after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses paid by the company  the net proceeds to the company approximated million 
during fiscal year  the company paid off its revolver loan balance and has spent approximately million to expand its manufacturing facilities and purchase capital equipment that will increase its manufacturing capacity and accommodate various new technological processes 
it is anticipated that in fiscal an additional million will be expended to complete the company s planned expansion 
the company has a  unsecured revolving line of credit 
as of june   no monies were borrowed against this line 
the company believes that its cash on hand  its anticipated cash flow from operations  and the amount available under its revolving credit facility  should be sufficient to meet its foreseeable needs 
the company has a deferred compensation obligation that is owed to the chairman of the board of directors 
under the current arrangement  monthly payments begin in june  or the first month after the termination of employment  whichever occurs first  and continues for no fewer than months or  at the election of the employee prior to his termination of employment  for up to months 
amounts to be paid within one year are not expected to be material

sfas no 
will be adopted by the company during fiscal year this standard is not expected to have a material effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations and financial statement disclosures 
year disclosure statement the year will effect not only the company s internal computer systems  but also those external systems with which the company exchanges any date related information  its customers  suppliers  banks  insurance companies  stockholders  etc 
in order to properly assess the extent this problem may have on its operations  the company has and is continuing to survey its key suppliers  service providers  and trading partners as to their level of preparedness and the effect it will have on the company s operations 
the company is confident that its enterprise system will be fully year compliant by the first quarter of quite apart from the year problem  the company is in the process of replacing its legacy computer system with a client server system for which both the hardware and software has been certified as year compliant 
the total cost of this project is approximately  of which approximately  was expended during fiscal the company is in the process of inventorying all its mission critical manufacturing systems in order to determine any year issues that may exist 
while the company anticipates that some software upgrades will be required  it does not believe that any issues exist which will prevent these systems from operating as expected after january  this inventory will be completed by the beginning of the fourth quarter of and testing to identify needed remediation will be completed by the end of that quarter 
any required remediation of all mission critical systems will be completed by the end of the first quarter of and the testing necessary to validate compliance is scheduled to be completed by mid the year issue does present some risk that the company s operation may suffer disruption as a result of either a computer malfunction or a corruption of date sensitive data 
if this does occur  the company believes that it most likely will be due to factors external to the company 
because of the company s internal year program  the company does not believe there is a significant risk of disruption of operations due to malfunction of its internal systems or equipment 
certain factors that may affect future operating results this report contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
when used in this report  the worked believes  expects  anticipates  intends  estimates  should  will likely and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
the cautionary statements made in this report should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements wherever they appear herein 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
important factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those herein 
the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
fluctuations in operating results  variability of orders 
the company s operating results have historically been subject to fluctuations  and the company expects that they will continue to fluctuate due to a variety of factors  including the timing and volume of orders from  and shipments to  customers  the timing of introductions of and market acceptance of new products and general economic trends 
typically  in the flexible interconnect industry  a substantial portion of sales in a given quarter depends on obtaining orders for products to be manufactured and shipped in the same quarter in which those orders are received 
although the company monitors its customers needs  it often has limited knowledge of the magnitude or timing of future orders 
as a result  the timing of revenues may be affected by the need to ramp up to or down from volume production in response to fluctuations in customer demand  the introduction of replacement products or the balancing of inventory 
a significant decrease in the number  magnitude or timing of orders in any given quarter could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
because it is difficult for the company to readily reduce spending on certain operating expenses  such as fixed manufacturing costs  development costs and ongoing customer service  a reduction in sales could have a material adverse effect on near term profit margins 
results of operations in any given period are therefore not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is possible that in some future quarter the company s operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
expansion of manufacturing capacity 
the company believes its long term competitive position depends in part on its ability to increase its manufacturing capacity 
the company s business  financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected if the company is not able to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand for its products 
the company intends in the future to expand its manufacturing capacity 
the failure of the company to complete the expansion on schedule and within budget could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and operating results 
in addition  the company is in the process of implementing new operations control and accounting information systems  which may temporarily impact the company s operations 
market and customer concentration 
applications for flexible interconnects include automotive electronics  military aerospace products  computers and computer peripherals  telecommunications subscriber and infrastructure equipment  as well as circuits and cables for medical and industrial applications 
although the company markets products for each of these applications in order to avoid a dependency on any one sector  a significant downturn in any of these market sectors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
historically  the company has sold a substantial portion of its flexible interconnects to a limited number of customers 
in fiscal   and  sales to motorola accounted for approximately  and respectively  of the company s total revenues and the company s top customers accounted for approximately  and of the company s total revenues  respectively 
the company expects that a limited number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of its total revenues in the foreseeable future 
the loss of a significant customer or a substantial reduction in orders by any significant customer could reduce the company s cash flow and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
current and future capital needs 
the development and manufacture of flexible interconnects is highly capital intensive 
in order to remain competitive  the company must continue to make significant expenditures for capital equipment  expansion of operations and research and development 
the company expects that substantial capital will be required to expand its manufacturing capacity and fund working capital for anticipated growth 
to the extent the company s financial resources are insufficient to fund these activities  the company will need to raise additional funds either through borrowings or further equity financings 
there can be no assurance that such additional capital will be available on reasonable terms or at all 
the inability of the company to obtain adequate additional financing on reasonable terms when needed would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
furthermore  the company s credit facility contains various financial covenants predicated on the company s present and future financial condition 
in the event the company is no longer able to meet the covenants contained in the credit facility  it may be required to repay the debt incurred thereunder 
foreign operations 
the company is currently expanding its operations globally 
the company owns a equity interest in a joint venture in china 
manufacturing and sales operations outside the united states are accompanied by a number of risks inherent in international operations  including imposition of governmental controls  compulsory licensure requirements  compliance with a wide variety of foreign and united states export laws  currency fluctuations  unexpected changes in trade restrictions  tariffs and barriers  political and economic instability  longer payment cycles typically associated with foreign sales  difficulties in administering business overseas  labor union issues and potentially adverse tax consequences 
although the company s current products are designed to meet the regulatory standards of certain foreign countries  any inability to meet foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
competition 
the company s business is highly competitive 
the flexible interconnect industry is differentiated by customers  markets and geography  with each niche having its own combination of complex packaging and interconnect requirements 
the company experiences competition worldwide in the flexible interconnect market from a number of foreign and domestic providers as well as from alternative technologies such as rigid printed circuits 
many of the company s competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than the company 
there can be no assurance that existing or future competitors will not be able to duplicate the company s strategies or that the company will continue to be able to compete successfully 
limited sources of supply 
the company purchases raw materials  process chemicals and various components from multiple outside sources 
in fiscal  the company s largest supplier of raw materials was dupont  from which it purchased in excess of of its materials and supplies 
any unanticipated disruption in shipments from dupont would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
although there exist alternate suppliers for the raw materials  process chemicals and various components that the company currently purchases from its suppliers  because of the company s limited inventory of raw materials and tight manufacturing cycles  any unanticipated interruption of supply could have a short term material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operation results 
intellectual property 
the company relies on a combination of patent and trade secret laws and non disclosure and other contractual agreements to protect its proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that the company s efforts to protect its intellectual property will be effective in preventing misappropriation or that others may not independently develop similar technology 
in addition  litigation may be necessary to protect the company s proprietary rights or to defend against claims of infringement 
although no claims have been asserted against the company for infringement of the proprietary rights of others  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert such claims in the future 
if any infringement claim is asserted  the company may be required to obtain a license of such rights 
there can be no assurance that any such license would be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
litigation with respect to patents and other intellectual property matters could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and other resources and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial and operating results 
technological change 
the market for the company s products and services is characterized by rapidly changing technology and continuing process development 
the future success of the company s business will depend in large part upon its ability to maintain and enhance its technological capabilities  develop and market products and services that meet changing customer needs and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes on a cost effective and timely basis 
in addition  the flexible interconnect industry could in the future encounter competition from new technologies that render interconnect technology less competitive or obsolete 
there can be no assurance that the company will effectively respond to the technological requirements of the changing market 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the materials and processes that the company is currently developing will result in commercially viable technological processes or that there will be commercial applications for these technologies 
to the extent that the company determines that new technologies and equipment are required to remain competitive  the development  acquisition and subsequent implementation of such technologies and equipment are likely to continue to require significant capital investment 
the company s failure to keep pace with technological change could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and operating results 
dependence on key personnel 
the company is dependent upon a number of its key management personnel 
in addition  the future success of the company depends on its continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
the loss of service of one or more key individuals  or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the company maintains a key person life insurance policy in the amount of million on each of mr

environmental regulations 
the company is subject to a variety of environmental laws relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  manufacture  use and disposal of chemicals  solid and hazardous waste and other toxic and hazardous materials used to manufacture  or resulting from the process of manufacturing  the company s products 
the company cannot predict the nature  scope or effect of future legislation or regulatory requirements to which its operations might be subject or the manner in which existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted  including whether they will be applied in the future to materials  product or activities to which they have not been applied previously 
complying with a new or more stringent laws or regulations  or to more vigorous enforcement of the current or future policies of regulatory agencies  could require substantial expenditures by the company and could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and operating results 
environmental laws and regulations require the company to maintain and comply with a number of permits  authorizations and approvals and to maintain and update training programs and safety data regarding materials used in its processes 
violations of those requirements could result in financial penalties and other enforcement actions  and could require the company to halt one or more portions of its operations until a violation is cured 
although the company works to operate in compliance with these environmental laws  there can be no assurance that the company will succeed in that effort at all times 
the combined costs of curing incidents of non compliance  resolving enforcement actions that might be initiated by government authorities or satisfying business requirements following any period affected by the need to take such actions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of june   the company is exposed to market risks which include changes in us and foreign interest rates and fluctuations in exchange rates 
the company maintains a portion of its cash and cash equivalents in financial instruments with purchased maturities of three months or less 
these financial instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates decrease 
due to the short duration of these financial instruments  an immediate decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect upon the company s financial position 
the company s outstanding bank loan bears interest at a rate of basis points over the singapore interbank offer rate sibor and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
however  the company has the option to pay the balance in full at any time without penalty 
as a result  the company believes that the market risk is not material 
the company also has a revolving credit agreement which bears interest at the bank s corporate base rate which is also affected by changes in market interest rates 
the company does not have any outstanding borrowings at june  and has the option to repay borrowings at anytime without penalty and therefore believes that the market risk is not material 
the remainder of the company s long term debt bears interest at fixed rates and are therefore not subject to market risk 
the company has a subsidiary located in shanghai  china 
sales are typically denominated in the local currency functional currency  thereby creating exposure to changes in exchange rates 
the changes in the chinese us exchange rate may positively or negatively impact the company s sales  gross margins and retained earnings 
based upon the current volume of transactions in china and the stable nature of the exchange rate between china and the us  the company does not believe the market risk is material
