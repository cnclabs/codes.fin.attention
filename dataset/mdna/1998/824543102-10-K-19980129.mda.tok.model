item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the company is a vertically integrated steel processor that supplies blanks  stampings and processed steel  as well as designs and builds tools for the automotive and other industries 
the company currently provides a broad range of intermediate steel processing services  which include i blanking and stamping  and ii other steel processing services which include pickling hot rolled steel  slitting  edge trimming  roller leveling and cutting to length of both hot and cold rolled steel 
with the august purchase of c h  the company operates through nine subsidiaries  shiloh corporation  valley city steel company  the sectional die company  medina blanking  inc  sectional stamping  inc  liverpool coil processing  inc  shiloh of michigan  the company s joint venture with rouge  greenfield and c h 
in  the company prepared a long term  business plan which included a strategic decision to concentrate on core steel processing services 
as a result  the company sought inquiries from prospective bidders for the sale of its subsidiary  shafer valve 
effective april   the company accounted for shafer valve as a discontinued operation 
in may  the company entered into an agreement to sell the stock of shafer valve to bettis corporation 
the sale was completed on july  the company typically experiences decreased revenue and operating income during the first fiscal quarter of each year  usually resulting from slower overall automobile production during the winter months 
the revenues and operating income in the third fiscal quarter can also be affected by the typically lower automobile production activities in july due to manufacturers changeover in production lines 
in analyzing the financial aspects of the company s steel processing operations  a number of factors must be considered 
first  plant utilization levels are very important to profitability because of the capital intensive nature of these operations 
because the company performs a number of different processing operations  however  it is not meaningful to analyze simply the total tons of steel processed 
for example  blanking and stamping involve more operational processes  from the design and manufacture of tools and dies to the production and packaging of the final product  than the company s other steel processing services and therefore generally have higher margins 
second  a significant portion of the company s steel processing products and services is provided to customers on a toll processing basis 
under these arrangements  the company charges a specified toll processing fee for the processing operations performed without acquiring ownership of the steel and being burdened with the attendant costs of ownership and risk of loss 
although the proportion of tons processed by the company that are directly owned and toll processed may fluctuate from quarter to quarter primarily based on the customers for which the company is providing services during such period  the company estimates that during the past three years approximately  and  respectively  of total tons processed was done on a toll processing basis 
revenues from operations involving directly owned steel include a component of raw material cost whereas toll processing revenues do not  consequently  toll processing generally results in lower gross profit  but higher gross margin  than directly owned steel processing 
therefore  an increase in the proportion of total revenues attributable to directly owned steel processing may result in higher revenues and gross profits but lower gross margins 
the company s blanking and stamping operations use more directly owned steel than do its other steel processing operations 
in addition  changes in the price of steel can impact the company s results of operations because raw material costs are by far the largest component of cost of sales in processing directly owned steel 
results of operations the following table sets forth  the periods indicated  income statement data of the company expressed as a percentage of revenues years ended october  revenues cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income from continuing operations interest expense

gross profit increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for the comparable period in gross margin increased to in fiscal from for the comparable period in the increase in gross margin is primarily attributable to a shift in the mix of toll and directly owned steel processing at certain facilities and the value added services provided by the inclusion of greenfield

gross profit increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for the comparable period in fiscal gross margin increased to in fiscal from for the comparable period in fiscal the increase in gross margin is principally due to management s continued efforts to contain costs and recover historical steel price increases through higher sale prices to its customers 
continued improvements in gross margin will be more difficult to achieve as the impact of these price increases lessens 
in addition  the increase in toll processing sales as a percentage of total sales contributed to gross margin improvement 
selling  general and administrative expenses
