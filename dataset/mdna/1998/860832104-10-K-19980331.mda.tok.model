pave mark manufactures and markets thermoplastic pavement marking materials and related application equipment used primarily for highway marking 
the results of operations  assets  liabilities and cash flows attributable to this acquisition have been included in the company s consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition 
the company s sales are seasonal 
the domestic highway maintenance and construction season tends to reach its peak in the second and third quarters of the year  and domestic sales of the company s products are generally highest in these quarters 
while international sales are also seasonal  international maintenance and construction seasons vary from the domestic season and tend to offset somewhat the seasonality of domestic sales 
international sales constituted  and of net sales in  and  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
because the company operates with little backlog  sales in any given quarter generally result from orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
accordingly  net sales and operating income are particularly sensitive to the timing of domestic market demand and tend to be highest in the second and third quarters  whereas net sales and operating income tend to be reduced during the first and fourth quarters  resulting in either operating losses or reduced earnings for those periods 
in addition  the company s performance in any given quarter is further affected by weather anomalies 
the company s sales are dependent on the ability and willingness of the federal and state governments to fund highway construction projects 
such sales may be affected by real or perceived uncertainty concerning the level of government funding for highway construction projects
