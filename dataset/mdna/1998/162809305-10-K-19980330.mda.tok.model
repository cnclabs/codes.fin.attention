management believes that cash flows generated from operations  and asset sales should allow the company to continue to meet its financial obligations and to pay operating expenses 
the company s prior operating results are not necessarily indicative of future results 
the company s future operating results may be affected by a number of factors  including uncertainties related to the general economy  competition  costs of food and labor  the company s ability to obtain adequate capital and to continue to lease or buy successful sites and construct new restaurants  and the company s ability to locate capable franchisees 
the price of the company s common stock can be affected by the above
