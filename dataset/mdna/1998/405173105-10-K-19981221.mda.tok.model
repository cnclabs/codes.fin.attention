this year  there would have been no material affect to the financial statements for the years ended september    and year general the year issue concerns the inability of information technology it and non information technology systems and processes to properly recognize and process date sensitive information before  during  and after december  the company presently expects that its core operations and essential functions will be ready for the year transition 
the company has appointed a full time project manager to coordinate the assessment and remediation of year issues affecting the company 
the company addressed the problem by creating a year plan that was developed using a bottom up planning approach  which includes all business units and physical facilities 
the company s year plan focuses on both it and non it systems and processes  including applications software programs that run the company s primary business systems  hardware pc software such as lans  servers  personal computers including operating systems and pc based software applications  telecommunications  and office equipment  engineering systems which include manufacturing and lab equipment  and facility systems that support physical infrastructure 
the company is also communicating with all of its customers  vendors and licensees regarding the status of their year compliance programs 
use of steering committee the company s year program includes a steering committee comprised of members from various functional groups 
the committee was established to provide an oversight and control function that reviews and evaluates the progress of the year program 
state of readiness the company s year program has company wide implications  which requires efforts from project leaders managing different projects 
the year program classifies the it and non it systems into critical  priority  required and desirable categories 
the critical category is defined as systems that must be in place at the turn of the century or business will be severely affected  such as the manufacturing and distribution systems and the retail point of sale system 
the priority category includes systems that the company can do without for only a few days such as telephones or energy management systems 
a required system is defined as a system needed to remain competitive or in compliance with laws and regulations such as security systems and voice mail 
the desirable systems enable employees to work more efficiently such as paging or copiers 
overall  the company s year compliance program was approximately complete as of november  which was principally on schedule with the program plan 
an evaluation of it and non it systems indicates that the remediation of the applications software programs for critical systems was complete  priority systems remediation was complete  and required systems remediation was complete 
the remediation of desirable applications software programs is scheduled to begin in the second quarter of fiscal altogether  applications software program projects were on schedule with an expected completion in july the remediation of hardware pc software was approximately complete for critical systems and complete for priority systems 
the remediation of required systems is complete and desirable hardware pc software is scheduled to start in the second quarter of fiscal in summary  hardware pc software projects were on schedule with intended completion by august remediation of critical engineering systems was complete and priority systems remediation was complete 
remediation of required and desirable systems is scheduled to begin in the second quarter of fiscal overall  engineering systems were essentially on schedule and expected to continue until december with substantially all systems remediation completed by august remediation of facilities systems was complete for critical systems and complete for priority systems 
remediation for required systems and desirable systems was and complete  respectively 
remediation of all facilities systems is on schedule with a planned completion by july significant third parties the company understands that there are risks associated with year issues that it cannot directly control  primarily the readiness of its key suppliers and customers 
the company s operations might be adversely affected by the failure of its significant customers or vendors to adequately address the year problem 
the company has contacted the majority of its customers and vendors and asked for information about their plans for addressing the year the company has received responses from most of its key customers  and as of september   none of the responses indicate that there will be a significant problem 
a number of the vendor responses have been received  which the company is in the process of reviewing 
the company intends to substantially complete its assessment of key customers and vendors by the second quarter of fiscal communications with customers and vendors will continue as more information becomes available in order to evaluate potential risks to the company s business operations 
cost to address year issues the company is executing the year program primarily with existing internal resources 
the company does not separately track the internal costs associated with the year program  however  the principal costs are related to payroll and the associated benefits for its information systems group 
year remediation costs are expensed in the year incurred 
as of september   the company has incurred costs for outside consultants  hardware and software applications that are not material to the results of operations or financial condition of the company 
in addition  the company does not expect future remediation expenditures to be material  except for the payroll and related benefits of its existing internal resources  which would have been incurred in any event 
at this time  the company does not anticipate separately tracking the costs of remediation for its existing internal resources 
no projects with any significant impact to the company s operations have been deferred due to the year program 
the company presently has elected to upgrade the accounting and manufacturing software  voice mail system  edi system and network servers due to the year issue 
these upgrades would not have occurred had the year problem not existed 
the cost of the upgrades is not material to the results of operations or financial condition of the company 
risks of year issues to date  the company has no indication that the time to replace or convert any specific function or system is so great as to threaten the company s present schedule 
the company s program and plans currently indicate compliant systems will be deployed by the end of august if the company completes its remediation plans  then any adverse effects from the year problem will result from circumstances outside the company s control 
as the company cannot anticipate such circumstances now  the company has not yet developed most reasonably likely worst case year scenarios 
the company  however  will begin examining potential scenarios and associated risks starting the second quarter of scenarios might include a possible but presently unforeseen failure of key vendor or customer business processes or systems 
this situation could conceivably persist for some months after the year transition and could lead to possible revenue losses 
although at this time the company believes that it is adequately addressing the year issues  there can be no assurance that the year issues will not have a material adverse effect on its business  financial conditions or results of operations 
in addition  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues could have a materially adverse effect to the company 
contingency plans to date  the company has been focusing on the conversion and replacement of non compliant systems 
in the second and third quarters of fiscal  the company anticipates developing contingency plans for potential interruptions in the supply chain  transportation  and communications with customers and vendors 
some of these plans could include use of alternate vendors or product designs that do not use raw materials from non compliant vendors  if any 
the company expects an assessment with an action plan in place by june for reasonably likely worst case year scenarios  if any
