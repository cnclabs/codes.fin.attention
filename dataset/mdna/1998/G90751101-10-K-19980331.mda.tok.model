sfas  accounting for income taxes  requires that the company make projections about the timing and scope of certain future business transactions in order to estimate recoverability of deferred tax assets primarily resulting from the expected utilization of net operating loss carryforwards nols 
changes in the timing or nature of actual or anticipated business transactions  projections and income tax laws can give rise to significant adjustments to the company s deferred tax expense or benefit that may be reported from time to time 
for these and other reasons  compliance with sfas may result in significant differences between tax expense for income statement purposes and taxes actually paid 
the income tax provision for and represented current and deferred taxes in colombia  deferred taxes on exploration projects throughout the world  and a deferred tax benefit in the united states related to anticipated future utilization of nols 
subject to the factors described above  the company currently expects that its foreign deferred tax provision will substantially exceed its current tax provision ie  actual taxes paid  resulting in an effective tax for income statement purposes that will exceed statutory tax rates  at least until the fields reach peak production 
the primary reason for the expected difference is the nondeductibility for colombian tax purposes of certain capital expenses and the treatment of reimbursements for pre commerciality costs as a return of capital under colombian tax laws 
conversely  colombian tax law permits the company to adjust the tax basis of certain assets based on the colombian inflation rate and to include any resulting increases in tax depreciation of the underlying asset based on rates of production and other factors 
the company s deferred tax liability has not been reduced to reflect the impact of this inflation adjustment

the equity swap has a notional amount of million and requires the company to make floating libor based payments on the notional amount to the counterparty 
in exchange  the counterparty is required to make payments to the company equivalent to of the dividends tpc receives with respect to its equity interest in ocensa 
upon a sale by the purchaser of the tpc shares  the company will receive from the counterparty  or make a cash payment to the counterparty  an amount equal to the excess or deficiency  as applicable  of the difference between of the net proceeds from the purchaser s sale of the tpc shares and the notional amount

the company accrued 
million for costs associated with final disposal of the segment  which occurred in august petroleum price risk management oil and natural gas sold by the company are normally priced with reference to a defined benchmark  such as light  sweet crude oil traded on the new york mercantile exchange wti 
actual prices received vary from the benchmark depending on quality and location differentials 
from time to time  it is the company s policy to use financial market transactions  including swaps  collars and options  with creditworthy counterparties primarily to reduce risk associated with the pricing of a portion of the oil and natural gas that it sells 
the policy is structured to underpin the company s planned revenues and results of operations 
the company may also enter into financial market transactions to benefit from its assessment of the future prices of its production relative to other benchmark prices 
there can be no assurance that the use of financial market transactions will not result in losses 
in anticipation of entering into a forward oil sale  the company purchased wti benchmark call options to retain the ability to benefit from future wti price increases above a weighted average price of per barrel

per barrel lower than if the company had not entered into such transactions 
international operations the company derives substantially all of its consolidated revenues from international operations 
a risk inherent in international operations is the possibility of realizing economic currency exchange losses when transactions are completed in currencies other than us dollars 
the company s risk of realizing currency exchange losses currently is largely mitigated because the company receives us dollars for sales of its petroleum products in colombia 
with respect to expenditures denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  the company generally converts us dollars to the local currency near the applicable payment dates to minimize exposure to losses caused by holding foreign currency deposits 
during the three year period ended december   the company did not realize any material foreign exchange losses from its international operations 
exploration operations costs related to acquisition  holding and initial exploration of licenses in countries with no proved reserves are initially capitalized  including internal costs directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities 
the company s exploration licenses are periodically assessed for impairment on a country by country basis 
if the company s investment in exploration licenses within a country where no proved reserves are assigned is deemed to be impaired  the licenses are written down to estimated recoverable value 
if the company abandons all exploration efforts in a country where no proved reserves are assigned  all exploration costs associated with the country are expensed 
due to the unpredictable nature of exploration drilling activities  the amount and timing of impairment expense are difficult to predict with any certainty 
financial information concerning the company s assets  including capitalized costs by geographic area  is in note of notes to consolidated financial statements

these laws regulate the discharge of oil  gas or other materials into the environment and may require the company to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of such materials at various sites 
also  the company may remain liable for certain environmental matters that may arise from formerly owned fuel businesses 
the company believes that the level of future expenditures for environmental matters  including clean up obligations  is impractical to determine with a precise and reliable degree of accuracy
