revenues from sales of single family homes for increased from  resulting primarily from a increase in the number of housing units delivered and a increase in the average sales price 
the average sales price is impacted by product mix  geographical mix and changing prices on units delivered 
new orders taken in increased from new orders taken in increased from the increases in new orders in and reflects the continued demand for new single family homes which the company believes was brought about by strong consumer confidence  opening of new home communities and stable mortgage interest rates 
gross margins the gross margin percentage for decreased from and the gross margin percentage for decreased from these decreases were primarily due to a more competitive housing environment  resulting in the increased use of sales incentives  the cost of which the company was not able to offset by increases in the average sales prices 
while gross margin percentage decreased compared to  the gross margin percentages for the fourth quarter of increased compared to the gross margin percentages for the third quarter of and the fourth quarter of 
there can be no assurance margins will continue to improve because they could be adversely affected by future events  including a change in the competitive housing environment and increases in construction labor and material costs 
backlog the backlog aggregate sales amount at december  increased compared to december   and at december  increased compared to december  the increases in the value of the backlog reflect the increases in the number of units under contract and increases in the average sales price 
substantially all of the company s backlog units at december   net of cancellations  are expected to result in revenues in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of housing revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses in remained the same when compared to and declined as compared to actual selling  general and administrative expenses for increased million compared to this increase was primarily due to increased payroll costs and advertising and marketing center expenses resulting from increased activities 
similarly  actual selling  general and administrative expenses for increased million compared to this increase was primarily due to increases in volume related expenses million resulting from the increase in deliveries in when compared to and increases in other selling  general and administrative expenses resulting from increased activities and earnings 
interest interest paid or accrued for increased approximately compared to and increased approximately in compared to the increase in was primarily due to increased average borrowings under the company s unsecured revolving credit agreement the credit facility and the sale of the company s senior notes due the senior notes and senior subordinated notes due the senior subordinated notes in august  offset in part by the redemption and conversion of the company s convertible subordinated debentures due the debentures and the purchase of a portion of the company s senior notes due the senior notes in september the increase in was primarily due to the sale of the company s senior notes due the senior notes in february  offset in part by a decrease in the average borrowings under the company s credit facility 
the company capitalizes interest cost into housing inventories and charges the previously capitalized interest to interest expense when the related inventories are delivered 
the amount of interest capitalized and previously capitalized interest expensed in any one year is a function of the amount of housing assets  land sales and the number of housing units delivered  average outstanding debt levels and average interest rates 
capitalized interest amounts charged to interest expense in were greater than and were greater than primarily due to the increase in the number of housing units delivered and higher average debt levels  offset in part by an increase in the amount of housing assets qualifying for interest capitalization 
financial services revenues revenues for the financial services segment for the periods indicated were as follows dollars in thousands years ended december  us home mortgage corporation and us    other financial services subsidiaries    us home mortgage corporation mortgage provides financing primarily to purchasers of homes sold by the company s housing operations through origination of residential mortgage loans and engages in the sale of such mortgages and related servicing rights to unaffiliated investors 
mortgage s operations are affected  among other things  by general economic conditions  consumer confidence and interest rate volatility 
these factors  together with the number of homes delivered by the company  affect the volume of loan originations which in turn impact the resulting volume of mortgages and servicing rights for sale 
approximately  and of the housing units delivered by the company in  and  respectively  were purchased using mortgage financing 
of the total housing units financed   and in  and  respectively  were financed by mortgage 
the increase in mortgage s revenues in from and in from was primarily due to an increase in mortgage loan originations and income from the sales of mortgage loans and servicing rights 
other impairment of land inventories during the fourth quarter of  in conjunction with the completion of the business plan  the company completed its annual detailed evaluation of the intended use of its land inventories to insure that the primary and planned use reflected the appropriate economic value for the company s intended use 
it was determined during the evaluation that based on economic forecasts for the current best use of certain land inventories located primarily in florida  maryland and texas had changed from the company s previous intended use 
based on the change in intended use  the company revised its cash flow estimates and determined the cash flow expected to be generated from the new intended use would be less than the cost of the land 
accordingly  the company recorded a non cash provision for impairment of approximately million million  net of income taxes to reduce the carrying value of the land to its current fair value  which amount has been included in provision for impairment of land inventories in the consolidated statements of operations 
the provision for impairment reduced basic and diluted earnings per common share in by

at the conclusion of this examination  the company reduced its deferred tax liability and recognized an income tax benefit totaling million related to the deductions allowed by the irs 
the company appealed the irs decision to disallow certain other deductions 
these deductions remain reserved as a deferred tax liability as of december  the decrease in the deferred tax liability increased basic and diluted earnings per common share in by

per share  respectively 
financial condition and liquidity housing the company is significantly affected by the cyclical nature of the homebuilding industry  which is sensitive to fluctuations in economic activity and interest rates and the level of consumer confidence 
sale of new homes are also affected by market conditions for rental properties and by the condition of the resale market for used homes  including foreclosed homes 
for example  an oversupply of resale units depresses prices and reduces the margins available on sales of new homes 
the sale of new homes and profitability from sales are heavily influenced by the level and expected direction of interest rates 
increases in interest rates tend to have a depressing effect on the market for new homes in view of increased monthly mortgage costs to potential home buyers 
the company s most significant needs for capital resources are land and finished lot purchases  land development and housing construction 
the company s ability to generate cash adequate to meet these needs is principally achieved from the sale of homes and the margins thereon  the utilization of company owned lots and borrowings under its financing facilities  including the credit facility 
in  the company completed a refinancing of a substantial portion of its public debt 
in august  the company sold million principal amount of its senior notes and million principal amount of its senior subordinated notes for the purpose of raising funds to redeem its debentures and purchase its senior notes 
in september  the company redeemed million principal amount of its debentures and purchased million principal amount of its senior notes through a tender offer and subsequent open market purchase for million in the aggregate 
also in september  million principal amount of the debentures was converted into  shares of the company s common stock 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in january  the company sold million principal amount of its senior notes due senior notes 
the net proceeds will be used to redeem the balance of the senior notes million which are first callable in june also in january and february  the company used a portion of the proceeds to purchase  in open market transactions  million principal amount of the senior notes 
the company currently intends to redeem the balance of these notes  though it may purchase such notes in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions prior to such date 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
pending redemption or other purchases of the remaining senior notes  the company intends to use the proceeds from the sale of the senior notes to reduce the company s outstanding borrowings under the credit facility and for general corporate purpose  including land and other investments and joint ventures 
the refinancing strengthens the company s capital structure by extending a substantial portion of its public debt maturities  which were due in and  to due dates of  and access to quality land and lot locations is an integral part of the company s success 
typically  in order to secure the rights to quality locations and provide sufficient lead time for development  the company must acquire land rights well in advance of when orders for housing units are expected to occur 
primarily in its affordable and move up home communities  the company attempts to minimize its exposure to the cyclical nature of the housing market and its use of working capital by employing rolling lot options  which enable the company to initially pay a small portion of the total lot cost and then purchase the lots on a scheduled basis 
however  with the increase in the number of retirement and active adult communities  the use of rolling lot options as a percentage of the company s total finished lot needs has and will continue to decrease since the majority of the finished lots for these communities are developed on land owned by the company 
in  and  respectively   and  of the units delivered have been on lots acquired under rolling lot option agreements 
the retirement and active adult communities are generally long term projects and require greater investments by the company than are required for its affordable and move up home communities 
these communities generally include more units than the affordable and move up communities and generally have more extensive amenities  including golf courses and club houses  which require substantial capital investment 
the increase in land inventories in from and from was primarily the result of increased activities  including an increase in the company s retirement and active adult communities activities 
the company has financed  and expects to continue to finance  its working capital needs from operations and borrowings  including those made under the company s credit facility 
the credit facility and previous credit facilities have enabled the company to meet peak operating needs 
in august  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement which has effectively fixed the interest rate on million of its credit facility borrowings until august in october  the credit facility borrowing commitment was increased from million to million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
also  certain of the properties owned or under option by the company may be located within community development districts districts formed by municipalities to construct and finance certain infrastructure improvements on property in the districts area 
the districts utilize ad valorem and assessment revenue bonds to fund improvements and repay the bonds by annual tax assessments on district property based on the property s relative value to other district property 
the company provides no credit support for and is not liable for the debt of the districts  except to the extent of actual assessments made by the districts 
the company may utilize districts to a greater extent in the future 
however  there can be no assurance that it will do so 
the net cash provided or used by the operating  investing and financing activities of the housing operations for the years ended december   and is summarized below dollars in thousands years ended december  net cash provided used by operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    net increase decrease in cash    housing operations are  at any time  affected by a number of factors  including the number of housing units under construction and housing units delivered 
although housing construction and land asset activities increased in over and increased in over  the amount of the increase in was less than the increase in and as a result activities used less cash than activities 
housing operating activities for used more cash than primarily due to an increase in housing proceeds receivables and the timing of payments related to construction and land asset activities  offset in part by the decrease in construction and land asset activities described above and the increase in the number of housing units delivered 
housing operating activities for used more cash than in primarily due to an increase in these activities offset in part by increased profitability and the timing of payments related to these activities 
cash flow from housing financing activities for provided cash reflecting the sale of the company s senior notes and senior subordinated notes and net borrowings under the credit facility  offset by the purchase of the company s senior notes and debentures and repurchase of common stock and class b warrants 
cash flow from housing financing activities in provided cash reflecting the sale of the company s senior notes  partially offset by the repayment of the amounts outstanding under the credit facility 
the company believes that cash flow from operations and amounts available under the credit facility will be sufficient to meet its current working capital obligations and other needs 
however  should the company require capital in excess of that which is currently available  there can be no assurance that it will be available 
financial services mortgage s activities represent a substantial portion of the financial services segment s activities 
as loan originations by mortgage are primarily from homes sold by the company s home building operations  mortgage s financial condition and liquidity are to a significant extent dependent upon the financial condition of the company 
financial services operating activities are affected primarily by the volume of mortgage s loan originations and the timing of the sale of mortgage loans and related servicing rights to third party investors 
loans and servicing rights are generally sold to investors within days after homes are delivered 
cash flow from financial services operating activities for provided more cash compared to primarily due to increased profitability  offset in part by an increase in residential mortgage loans receivable 
cash flow from financial services operating activities for provided less cash compared to primarily due to an increase in residential mortgage loan receivables 
the company finances its financial services operations primarily from short term debt which is repaid with internally generated funds  such as from the origination and sale of residential mortgage loans and related servicing rights 
as more fully discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the short term debt consists of a million secured revolving line of credit the mortgage credit facility which matures on august  while the mortgage credit facility contains numerous covenants  including a debt to tangible net worth ratio and a minimum tangible net worth requirement  these covenants are not anticipated to significantly limit mortgage s operations 
the company has no obligation to provide funding to its financial services operations  nor does it guarantee any of its financial services subsidiaries debt 
the company believes that internally generated funds and the mortgage credit facility will be sufficient to provide for mortgage s working capital needs 
other impact of inflation inflation not only affects interest rates on funds borrowed by the company  but also affects the affordability of permanent mortgage financing available to prospective customers 
increased construction costs associated with rising interest rates  as well as increased material costs  compress gross margins in the short term  but may be recovered in the long term through increases in sales prices  although such increases may reduce sales volume 
in recent years  inflation has not had a significant adverse effect on the company
