operating margin in was unchanged from the prior year at percent of sales 
selling price increases  part of which were implemented to cover a national advertising program  and more efficient use of raw materials led to higher gross margins 
housing group operating profits in fiscal would have been approximately million higher were it not for a change in the method of allocating intercompany supply group profits as explained below 
recreational vehicles total rv sales for fiscal rose nine percent to a new high of billion  up from billion in fiscal the company s motor home division generated a six percent sales increase to a record million on the strength of healthy demand for fleetwood s popular class a products 
the shift in product mix toward higher priced and more fully featured class a motor homes more than offset the effect of lower unit volume  which fell six percent to  units 
towable products fared well in fiscal as both travel trailer and folding trailer divisions achieved record sales

as a percentage of sales  operating income fell from percent to percent this year 
despite the rise in rv sales volume  margins decreased because of a decline in profitability in the company s motor home division

rv group operating income was reduced approximately million in fiscal by a change in the method of allocating intercompany supply group profits as explained below 
supply operations the company s supply group contributed revenues of nearly million for fiscal compared to million last year 
operating income  however  increased over seven fold to million 
approximately percent of this increase was due to a change in the method of allocating intercompany profits from the supply group to the housing and rv businesses 
prior to fiscal  income from lumber brokerage and import operations was allocated back to the company s core businesses that use these supply group services 
beginning in fiscal  the lumber and import operations were set up as separate profit centers 
prior year profits by segment were not restated to reflect this change 
change in estimate of insurance reserves the company self insures its primary layer of products liability risk 
products liability reserves are based upon claims projections from an independent actuarial study 
there can be significant variability in claims experience from year to year  and there is typically a long loss development period for products cases 
accordingly  actuarial projections are updated annually to reflect current loss development trends  which results in frequent adjustments to reserves for prior years cases 
because of the variability and long loss development of products liability claims  the company actuary has consistently followed conservative reserving practices 
in july  after several years of favorable claims experience  the company was able to lower its self insured retention ie  deductible from million to million of which losses of million have been paid for a five year underwriting period between and by entering into a commercial insurance contract 
prior to entering into the insurance contract  the company carefully reviewed the economics of the transaction and its implications as to current reserve levels 
the company concluded that  based upon recent favorable loss development trends a factor that was clearly confirmed by the proposed insurance arrangement  a change in estimate of reserves was appropriate 
the outcome was a million adjustment to estimated reserves  offset by a million premium for the outside insurance 
this resulted in an addition to operating income of million before taxes  and an increase to after tax earnings of million or cents per share 
compared to consolidated results a strong recovery in rv profits and a gain on the sale of the company s rv finance subsidiary led to record earnings in fiscal net income increased percent to million from million a year ago

in may the gain from this transaction and earnings from one month of operations prior to the sale were classified as discontinued operations 
income from continuing operations rose percent to million from million  and earnings per share rose percent to in fiscal from in fiscal fiscal earnings were reduced by a loss on the divestiture of the company s german rv operation and a revaluation of an investment in southern california real estate 
excluding these unusual items  earnings per share from continuing operations increased percent 
total revenues for fiscal increased two percent to a record billion on the strength of higher recreational vehicle sales 
gross profit declined to percent of sales  down from percent in the prior fiscal year 
rv margins were higher in fiscal due to increased operating efficiencies and a sales mix that favored higher margin motor home products 
however  this margin improvement was more than offset by lower manufactured housing profit margins that were affected by more competitive pricing and new plant start up costs 
operating expenses in fiscal declined slightly to million and dropped as a percentage of sales from to percent 
selling expenses of million in were down five percent  and were also lower as a percentage of sales  declining to percent from percent 
virtually all of the reduction in selling costs came in the rv group  largely due to lower product financing and sales promotion costs 
the rv reductions were substantially offset by higher costs in the manufactured housing group  mainly attributable to increases in product warranty and sales promotion expenses 
general and administrative expenses rose three percent to million  and increased as a percentage of sales to percent from percent 
most of the increase occurred in the rv group which experienced higher management incentive compensation costs due to substantially improved profits 
cost increases in the manufactured housing group were attributable to organizational changes and start up costs at new plants 
non operating income was million compared to a loss of million in the prior year 
the loss on the divestiture of the german rv operation and the real estate revaluation adjustment resulted in special charges totaling million or cents per share after taxes in fiscal investment income of million in was off percent from million in the prior year as funds available for investment were substantially reduced due to share repurchases 
interest expense rose to million from million last year as a result of the assumption of million of long term debt from fleetwood credit corp 
the combined federal and state income tax rate was percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal the lower fiscal tax rate reflects cumulative tax benefits related to the loss on disposition of the german rv operation 
manufactured housing manufactured housing sales were billion in fiscal  off one percent from the record sales of billion achieved in fiscal although housing shipments in dropped five percent to  homes  the volume of floors shipped fell only one percent to  reflecting a shift to greater sales of multi section homes 
fiscal operating profit for the manufactured housing group declined million or percent to million from million in fiscal in addition to lower sales  profits were impacted by lower gross margins  reflecting an increasingly competitive pricing environment 
higher operating expenses also contributed to the lower profits 
influencing these costs were the addition of four new manufacturing plants  administrative expenses associated with the restructuring of the sales and marketing and regional management organizations  as well as costs incurred for a sales promotion program designed to boost sales and reduce slow moving retailer inventories 
recreational vehicles rv sales increased six percent to billion compared to billion in the prior year  driven by a percent rise in motor home sales 
fiscal rv sales included million from the company s german rv subsidiary  which was sold in may excluding european sales from the comparison  rv revenues grew ten percent in fiscal motor home sales increased to a record million as unit volume rose seven percent to  and sales mix shifted to larger  higher priced products 
travel trailer sales of million were off one percent from the prior fiscal year with unit volume slipping six percent to  the company s folding trailer division generated sales of nearly million  off one percent due to a nine percent decline in shipments to  units  which was consistent with industry trends 
fiscal operating income for the rv group rose million or percent compared to the prior fiscal year 
increased revenues and a favorable mix of products with a higher percentage of more profitable motor home shipments were largely responsible for the improved results 
lower financing subsidies  resulting from the sale of fleetwood credit corp  also enhanced profitability 
supply operations supply revenues in fiscal increased seven percent to million due primarily to higher sales of lumber products 
operating profit for the same period  however  was down percent to million from million  primarily as a result of losses related to discontinuation of certain products and lower margins related to higher tariffs on raw lumber supplies imported from canada 
liquidity and capital resources the company generally relies upon internally generated cash flows to satisfy working capital needs and to fund capital expenditures 
positive cash flows were generated from internal sources in fiscal years and to support manufacturing operations and to fund capital expenditures and shareholder dividends 
cash generated from operations improved to million compared to million last year 
the company maintained a strong cash position in both years  with cash and investments totaling million in and million in cash equivalents received a boost late in fiscal from the proceeds of a million convertible preferred securities offering 
fiscal cash flows included million  net of income taxes  received from the sale of fleetwood credit corp 
these proceeds  along with cash from the sale of investment securities  were used to make significant share repurchases as explained below 
cash outflows in fiscal included million for the purchase of million shares of common stock from the company s founder and former chairman of the board 
other cash uses included capital expenditures of million and dividends to common shareholders of million 
cash outflows in fiscal included million for the purchase of percent of the company s outstanding common stock 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company completed a dutch auction tender offer that resulted in the purchase of million shares at a cost of million 
in the second quarter  the company acquired an additional million shares at a cost of million  which included million shares from the company s founder 
cash outflows in fiscal also included capital expenditures of million  dividends to stockholders of million and a long term debt repayment of million 
capital expenditures in fiscal and fiscal included the addition of new manufactured housing plants and the normal replacement of machinery and equipment 
in  a new travel trailer factory was added to replace an older existing facility 
during fiscal  four new manufactured housing plants were added and two were substantially completed  one of which became operational early in fiscal capital expenditures for manufacturing capacity in fiscal are expected to be below the levels experienced in recent years because  with few exceptions  the company believes it now has ample manufacturing capacity to satisfy expected levels of consumer demand for its products 
such expenditures are expected to be in the range of to million  and will include modifications at several existing locations along with the normal replacement of machinery and equipment 
in february  the company announced its intention to acquire homeusa  the nation s largest independent retailer of manufactured housing 
a combination of cash and common stock will be used to fund this acquisition  which is scheduled for completion in august the company estimates that approximately percent or million of the purchase price will be satisfied in cash 
additionally  the company is in the process of completing a number of smaller retailer acquisitions which will be partially paid for in cash 
part of the company s housing retail strategy includes the development of new company owned fleetwood home centers  which will also require cash outlays 
although a definitive capital budget for these various retail initiatives has not yet been finalized  it is the opinion of management that these capital expenditures can be funded with a combination of existing resources and expected future cash flows 
during the seasonally slow winter months typically november through february  the company has historically built inventories of rv s in order to meet the peak demand for these products in the spring 
this is usually accomplished without the use of debt financing  however  there have been occasions when the company has required the use of bank credit lines 
this situation occurred in the third quarter of fiscal  during the month of january when the company used uncommitted bank credit lines to borrow million for several days to meet working capital needs 
all borrowings were repaid during the fourth quarter 
the company has uncommitted credit lines with its principal bank and another bank which are currently being used only to support letters of credit 
the company anticipates that a combination of cash flow from operating activities  existing financial resources and a portion of the proceeds from the aforementioned preferred stock offering will be adequate to satisfy its currently foreseeable liquidity requirements  including its capital expenditure requirements for manufacturing and the housing retail business 
other in  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 reporting comprehensive income 
this statement  which must be adopted by the company in fiscal  establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components revenues  expenses  gains and losses in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
also in  the fasb issued statement no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  which establishes standards for the way that companies report information about operating segments in annual financial statements  and requires that those companies report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports issued to shareholders 
this statement must also be adopted in fiscal the company believes that the adoption of these two new standards will not have a material impact on its reported results of operations 
the company is dependent on a cluster of centralized computers to provide data in support of vital company wide operational and accounting functions 
many of the computer processes used to generate this data were programmed in house  following the common practice of using only two digits to designate a year 
as a consequence  as the year approaches  programs with date related logic will not be able to distinguish between the years and  potentially causing software and hardware to fail  generate erroneous calculations or present information in an unusable form 
in recognition of this potential  the company launched a year conversion project in february to correct and fully test all offending computer code by mid at this date  the project is progressing as planned and is expected to be completed on schedule 
given these efforts  management does not anticipate any appreciable impact on company operations related to the use of the company s computer systems in the new millennium 
the estimated amount the company plans to spend on the year project will not have a material effect on results of operations  liquidity or capital resources
