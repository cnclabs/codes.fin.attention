funds from operations is defined by nareit as net income or loss after preferred dividends computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and minority interest and excluding significant non recurring events that materially distort the comparative measurement of the company s performance over time 
funds from operations does not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by gaap and does not necessarily indicate that cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs 
it should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
funds from operations also does not represent cash flows generated from operating  investing or financing activities as defined by gaap 
funds from operations for the years ended december   and are as follows year ended december  in thousands income available to common shareholders    addback minority interest    depreciation and amortization    premium on debenture conversion  write off of deferred financing costs  gain on sale  funds from operations    inflation inflation has remained relatively low during the last three years  and as a result  has not had a significant impact on the company during this period 
the credit facility bears interest at a variable rate  therefore  the amount of interest payable under the credit facility will be influenced by changes in short term interest rates  which tend to be sensitive to inflation 
to the extent an increase in inflation would result in increased operating costs  such as in insurance  real estate taxes or utilities  substantially all of the tenant s leases require the tenants to absorb these costs as part of their rental obligations 
in addition  inflation also may have the effect of increasing market rental rates
