egghead also operates a customer service center which responds to inbound telephone calls and inquiries from consumers as well as corporate  government  reseller and educational institution customers and takes orders for the same hardware and software products that are offered on the company s web sites 
these inquiries are mainly generated by the company s promotional efforts which include both online and traditional advertising  principally through the limited circulation of its catalogs 
egghead ships merchandise purchased through the service directly to the customer from egghead s distribution center in vancouver  washington or from third party distributors 
the company s web sites and customer service center are referenced as ongoing operations in the following discussion of financial condition and results of operations 
continuing operations includes the retail store network during its existence and the ongoing operations  but excludes the corporate  government and educational cge division which the company sold in fy and the cge division is referred to as discontinued operations closure of retail network and downsizing the company recorded a loss from continuing operations of million in fiscal during fiscal  the company sold the cge division for million  not including proceeds from collection of related accounts receivable and liquidation of related inventory

during fiscal and  the retail store operating expenses  not including overhead of the headquarters and distribution facilities  were approximately million and million  respectively 
there can be no assurance that the elimination of the company s retail store network as a source of revenue will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
although the company s internet commerce site sales have grown significantly in recent periods  these sales represent a relatively small percentage of the company s historical total sales and there can be no assurance that similar growth  if any  will be obtained in the future

egghead had no outstanding borrowings under the line at the expiration date 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million from million at the end of fiscal to million at march  the decrease in the cash balance was primarily due to a reduction in accounts payable and liabilities related to the cge division  partially offset by a reduction in accounts receivable and merchandise inventories

the company believes that current cash and cash equivalent balances will be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future 
however  any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy the company s liquidity requirements  the company may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or to obtain a line of credit 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities could result in additional dilution to the company s stockholders 
there can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
in addition  the company will  from time to time  consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses  products and technologies  which might increase the company s liquidity requirements or cause the company to issue additional equity or debt securities 
the company does not currently use derivative financial instruments 
the company is also developing a plan to modify its information technology to recognize the year and has  to the extent necessary  begun upgrading certain critical data processing systems 
since the company s systems and software are relatively new and the majority are covered by maintenance agreements with the vendors  management does not expect year issues related to its own internal systems to be significant 
there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies  on which the company relies  will be converted timely and will not have an adverse effect on the company s systems 
egghead continues to evaluate the estimated costs associated with these efforts based on the costs of past programming changes and does not expect the future costs of resolving its internal year problems to be material 
the company currently expects the project to be complete in however  no assurance can be given that the company s computer systems will be year compliant in a timely manner  that the company will not incur significant additional expenses pursuing year compliance or that the year problem will not have a material adverse effect on the company in the future
