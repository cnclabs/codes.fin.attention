due to the inherent uncertainty of future premium levels  losses  economic conditions and other factors that impact earnings  it is impossible to predict with any degree of certainty the impact of such higher claims frequencies on future earnings 
during periods of significant refinancing activity  it is possible that policies on stronger loans may lapse and that weaker loans may remain in force  thus potentially increasing the loss ratio on older business 
substantial increases in production of new business during these periods can offset the increased loss ratio on the older business

for  the company generated positive cash flow from operating activities of million compared to million for the increase in triad s operating cash flow reflects the growth in renewal premiums and insurance written that has more than offset the increases in claims paid and other expenses 
the company s business does not routinely require significant capital expenditures 
positive cash flows are invested pending future payments of claims and expenses 
cash flow shortfalls  if any  could be funded through sales of short term investments and other investment portfolio securities 
the parent company s cash flow is dependent on cash dividends and revenues from management fees from triad 
the insurance laws of the state of illinois impose certain restrictions on dividends from triad 
these restrictions  based on statutory accounting practices  include requirements that dividends may be paid only out of statutory earned surplus as of the end of the preceding fiscal year and limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of the illinois insurance department 
triad had an earned surplus of million at december  and a deficit of million at december  the illinois insurance department permits expenses of the parent company to be paid by triad in the form of management fees 
in january the company completed a million private offering of senior notes due january  the notes  which represent unsecured obligations of the company  bear interest at a rate of per annum and are non callable 
the notes are rated a by standard and poor s corporation and a by fitch investors service 
the company contributed million of the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to triad in exchange for a surplus debenture 
the company will be dependent upon payments under the surplus debenture issued by triad and upon possible future dividends from triad  all of which will be subject to significant payment restrictions under illinois insurance laws  to provide funds for the payment of the company s obligations under the notes

the company intends to invest the proceeds of the note offering in accordance with its investment policy 
to date  the company s investments have emphasized tax preferred securities 
because of restrictions imposed under federal income tax laws  investment by the company of proceeds of the note offering must be made principally in taxable securities 
through investment of a portion of the net proceeds of the note offering  the company plans to increase its investments in higher yielding non investment grade securities to approximately of its consolidated portfolio  up from approximately at december  consolidated invested assets were million at december   including a total of million in fixed maturity securities and equity securities classified as available for sale 
net unrealized investment gains were million on equity securities and million on fixed maturity securities at december  approximately or million of the company s fixed maturity portfolio at december  was composed of mortgage backed securities  substantially all of which are guaranteed by us government agencies 
certain mortgage backed securities are subject to significant prepayment risk due to the fact that  in periods of declining interest rates  mortgages may be repaid more rapidly than scheduled as borrowers refinance higher rate mortgages to take advantage of lower rates 
as a result  holders of mortgage backed securities may receive large prepayments on their investments which must be reinvested at then current rates 
the company s loss reserves increased to million at december  compared to million at december  this growth is the result of the increases in new insurance written and the maturing of the company s risk in force 
consistent with industry practices  the company does not establish loss reserves for future claims on insured loans which are not currently in default 
the company s reserves per delinquent loan were  at both december  and december  the company s ratio of delinquent insured loans to total insured loans was at december  compared to at december the company s unearned premium reserve of million at december  decreased from million at december  this decline is attributable primarily to the continued production of the monthly premium product  which produces little unearned premium compared to annual and single premium products 
cancellation activity also can contribute to the decrease in unearned premiums  whereby older annual premium policies are canceled or replaced by monthly premium policies

the balance in the statutory contingency reserve was million at december  compared to million at december  the company is undertaking modifications and upgrades to enhance its computer systems and technological capabilities 
the company expects that approximately million will be expended in to complete this system upgrade and that the project will be funded through cash flow from operations

the company expects to incur internal staff costs as well as consulting and other expenses related to infrastructure and facilities enhancement necessary to prepare the systems for the year most of the modifications will be made as part of the company s capital upgrade to its computer systems throughout triad s ability to write insurance depends on the adequacy of its statutory capital in relation to risk in force 
a significant reduction of capital or a significant increase in risk may impair triad s ability to write additional insurance 
a number of states limit triad s risk to capital ratio to to as of december  triad s risk to capital ratio was to  and as of december  was to  as compared to to for the industry as a whole at december   the latest industry data available 
rating agencies also require capital levels based on a company s performance sensitivity to various depression scenarios 
in determining capital levels  the rating agencies allow the use of different forms of capital including statutory capital  reinsurance and debt 
the effect of the company s contribution of million of its million senior note offering to the capital of triad in january will be to improve its risk to capital ratio and to provide additional capital considered in the rating agency s depression models 
had the contribution been made as of year end  triad s risk to capital ratio would have been approximately to there can be no assurance that the company will continue to meet such capital requirements
