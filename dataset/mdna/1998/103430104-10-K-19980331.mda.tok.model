the company s principal source of revenue is lease payments from lessees pursuant to the percentage leases 
percentage lease revenue is based upon the room  food and beverage and other revenues of the company s hotels 
the lessees ability to make payments to the company pursuant to the percentage leases is dependent primarily upon the operations of the hotels 
since bmc contributes a significant portion of the company s lease revenues  management believes that a discussion of the historical and pro forma operations of bmc and the historical operations of the initial hotels is important to understand the business of the company 
the following discusses i the company s actual results of operations for the year ended december  and the period from november  inception of operations through december   and pro forma results of operations for the years ended december  and  ii bmc s actual results of operations for the year ended december  and the period from november  inception of operations through december   and pro forma results of operations for the years ended december  and  and iii the historical results of operations for the initial hotels for the period january  to november  and the year ended december  the pro forma information of the company is presented as if the initial offering and related formation transactions  and the company s acquisitions of the melborne hilton oceanfront  holiday inn crabtree  french lick springs resort  holiday inn minneapolis west  marriott s hunt valley inn and hampton inn san diego airport sea world  had been consummated as of january  the pro forma information excludes the results of the daytona beach radisson resort and the doubletree hotel kansas city  as these hotels were not operating during the entire twelve month pro forma periods

minority interest applicable to the operating partnership and joint venture partnerships in the income before extraordinary item of the partnership was million in  or of total revenues  compared to  or  in extraordinary charges net of minority interest of  and  in and  respectively decreased from million in to  in the extraordinary charge in represented the write off of deferred financing costs incurred in connection with increasing the credit facility in october and the retirement of mortgage indebtedness of one of the joint ventures 
the extraordinary charge in represented the write off of deferred financing costs and the payment of prepayment penalties and fees incurred in connection with the retirement of all mortgage indebtedness assumed by the partnership upon formation of the company 
the company s funds from operations ffo in was million compared to million in the white paper on ffo approved by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit in march defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after comparable adjustments for the company s portion of these items related to unconsolidated entities and joint ventures 
the company believes that ffo is helpful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity reit because  along with cash flow from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities  it provides investors with an indication of the ability of the company to incur and service debt  to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs 
the company computes ffo in accordance with standards established by nareit which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than the company 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of the company s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make cash distributions 
ffo may include funds that may not be available for management s discretionary use due to functional requirements to conserve funds that may not be available for management s discretionary use due to functional requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures and property acquisitions  and other commitments and uncertainties

the increase for over is primarily the result of increases in the average daily rates adr and improvements in occupancy rates experienced at the hotels 
pro forma expenses before minority interest  consisting principally of depreciation and amortization  property taxes  insurance  ground rent  general administrative expenses and interest expense would have been million  representing a million  or  increase over expenses of million 
as a percentage of revenues  the company s expenses before minority interest would have increased from in to in the principal factors for this increase are attributable to general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization  and taxes  insurance and ground rent expense 
general and administrative expenses would have increased  in compared to  or  primarily attributable to incremental costs associated with hiring management personnel to support the company s strategic growth objectives 
pro forma depreciation and amortization would have increased from million in to million in  an increase of 
million  or  related to additional depreciation associated with capital expenditures 
real estate and personal property taxes  insurance and ground rent expense would have increased from million in to million in  or  primarily because of inflation and the reassessment of certain hotels acquired in pro forma interest expense would have increased slightly between years  because of higher average borrowing levels in compared to associated with funding capital expenditures  offset somewhat by lower interest rates in pro forma ffo for the year ended december  increased to million compared to million in the increase in ffo in is attributable to the increase in percentage lease revenues 
the pro forma results of operations do not include the pro forma revenues and expenses associated with the daytona beach radisson resort or the doubletree hotel kansas city  as the hotel revenue and expense information for the pro forma periods is not available 
the daytona beach radisson resort was closed for renovation during most of prior to its reopening in january the doubletree hotel kansas city was also closed for renovation during most of and the first quarter of before its reopening in april the company expects that the performance of these hotels will contribute significantly to the company s profitability in during  the pro forma adr at the hotels increased to compared to in  representing a increase 
the weighted average occupancy also increased to compared to in these increases resulted in an increase in revpar of  to in compared to in the following table sets forth the pro forma operating data of the hotels owned by the company as of december   without regard to when the company acquired the hotels

no assurance can be given that the trends reflected in this data applicable to the hotels  or any trends associated with the hotels  will continue or that adr  occupancy and revpar will not decrease as a result of changes in national or local economic or hospitality industry conditions 
moreover  if the proposed merger is completed  there is no assurance that the company will be able to assimilate the doubletree hotels successfully or to realize the anticipated benefits of the proposed merger 
bmc actual results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the period from november  inception of operations to december  for the year ended december  bmc had hotel revenues of million compared to million in the increase was because of the partial year in and an increase in the number of hotels leased  from nine at december  to at december  bmc recorded net income of million in compared to a net loss of  in the loss in was partially the result of the application of the percentage lease rent terms during an interim period as opposed to a full calendar year 
the terms of each percentage lease allow for annualizing the rent payable to compensate for the effects of seasonality when base rents may be required during periods of lower occupancy which would otherwise be offset during peak seasons 
historically  the fourth quarter has been a period of lower occupancy for the initial hotels on a combined basis in comparison to the other three quarters of the year

the overall increases in adr and occupancy rates resulted in an increase in revpar from in to in as a percentage of total hotel revenues  departmental and other expenses decreased from in to in the period because of the increase in adr and a change in hotel revenue mix to more profitable rooms revenue

liquidity and capital resources the company s principal source of cash to meet its cash requirements  including distributions to shareholders  is its share of the partnership s cash flow from the percentage leases 
the lessees obligations under the percentage leases are unsecured and the lessees ability to make rent payments to the partnership under the percentage leases  and the company s liquidity  including its ability to make distributions to shareholders  are dependent on the lessees ability to generate sufficient cash flow from the operation of the hotels and the hotels 
as of december   the company had  of cash and cash equivalents and had outstanding borrowings totaling  against the credit facility 
the company obtained the credit facility to assist in funding its acquisitions and development of additional hotels and for certain other purposes  including capital expenditures and working capital  as necessary 
borrowings under the credit facility are secured by first mortgages on thirteen of the hotels  including lease revenues generated from such properties 
the credit facility expires in november  with an additional one year extension at the company s option 
borrowings against the credit facility bear interest at a floating rate of to over various eurodollar libor rates at december  
the company is required to pay a 
fee on the unused portion of the credit facility 
the credit facility requires  among other things  the maintenance of a minimum net worth  and specified coverage ratios of ebitda to debt service and ebitda to debt service and fixed charges 
on october  the credit facility was amended to increase the maximum amount of borrowings from million to million 
all borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at the time of the offering were paid in full with the net proceeds from the offering 
the company has obtained a commitment for a new unsecured credit facility of up to million  to be available on completion of the proposed merger 
the company also obtained a commitment for a million year term loan the fixed rate loan secured by the doubletree hotels  with a rate of interest at a spread over the year united states treasury bond upon closing of the loan 
interest only will be paid for the first two years  with principal repayments commencing in the third loan year based on a year amortization schedule 
the company anticipates that the fixed rate loan and new credit facility will enable the company to finance the proposed merger and to meet its anticipated cash needs for the next year 
the company may seek to negotiate additional credit facilities  or issue debt instruments 
any debt incurred or issued by the company may be secured or unsecured  long term  medium term or short term  bear interest at a fixed or variable rate  and be subject to such other terms as the board of directors considers prudent 
the company estimates that on a pro forma basis giving effect to the offering  the closing of the proposed merger  and the borrowings under the fixed rate loan and the new credit facility  the company would have approximately million in outstanding indebtedness and available borrowing capacity under the credit facility of million 
the company will acquire or develop additional hotel properties only as suitable opportunities arise  and the company will not undertake acquisition or development of properties unless adequate sources of financing are available 
funds for future acquisitions or development of hotels are expected to be derived  in whole or in part  from borrowings under the fixed rate loan  credit facility or other borrowings or from the proceeds of additional issuances of common shares or other securities 
in november  the company filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for the issuance of up to million in securities over the next two years 
securities issued under this registration statement may be preferred shares  depository shares  common shares or any combination thereof and may be issued at different times  depending on market conditions 
warrants to purchase these securities may also be issued 
the terms of issuance of any securities covered by this registration statement would be determined at the time of their offering 
the million of common shares sold in the offering were sold under this registration statement 
on march   the company acquired two hotel properties for an aggregate consideration of million  which was funded with cash proceeds from the offering and borrowings under the credit facility 
these properties were leased to bmc  which will operate the properties under long term percentage leases 
also  in february the company entered into an agreement to purchase a hotel located in fort myers beach  florida for aggregate consideration of million 
this transaction  if completed  will be funded from borrowings under the credit facility and the property will be leased to a subsidiary of south seas properties company  which will manage the resort under a long term percentage lease 
consummation of the transaction is subject to various uncertainties and conditions  and there is no assurance that the transaction will be consummated 
the percentage leases require the company to establish aggregate minimum reserves for capital expenditures equal to specified percentages of total revenues of the hotels and the hotels 
in addition  the company intends to make capital expenditure funds available from the credit facility  as needed 
the company intends to use the reserve for capital improvements to the hotels and for refurbishment and replacement of furniture  fixtures and equipment  but may make other uses of amounts reserved that it considers appropriate from time to time 
the company anticipates making similar arrangements with respect to future hotels that it may acquire or develop 
during the year ended december   the company made million of capital expenditures 
the company considers the majority of these improvements to be revenue producing and therefore these amounts have been capitalized and are being depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
over the next months  the company s major capital expenditure plans include i a million upgrade of the berkeley marina hotel in connection with its conversion to a radisson  including a complete upgrade and modernization of the exterior  front entrance  lobby and half of the guest rooms  ii a million renovation of the holiday inn minneapolis west  including a new upscale concierge floor to cater to business travelers and renovation of the guest rooms and public areas  iii the continuation of the company s million renovation of the holiday inn crabtree s exterior  windows  guest rooms  common areas  lobby and pool  iv a million expenditure at the french lick springs resort for general upgrades and improvements  and v a million renovation of the cleveland airport marriott s exterior  guest rooms  and lobby and public areas 
inflation the company s revenues are based on percentage leases  which result in changes in the company s revenues based on changes in the revenues of its hotels 
therefore  the company relies entirely on the performance of the hotels and the lessees ability to increase revenues to keep pace with inflation 
operators of hotels in general  and the company s lessees  can change room rates quickly  but competitive pressures may limit the lessees ability to raise rates to keep pace with inflation 
the company s general and administrative costs  as well as real estate and personal property taxes  property and casualty insurance and ground rent  are subject to inflation 
seasonality the company s hotels operations historically have been seasonal 
thirteen of the hotels and the hotels maintain higher occupancy rates during the second and third quarters 
the four hotels located in florida experience their highest occupancy in the first quarter 
this seasonality pattern can be expected to cause fluctuations in the company s quarterly lease revenue under the percentage leases 
the company anticipates that its cash flow from the percentage leases will be sufficient to enable the company to continue to make quarterly distributions at the current rate for the next twelve months 
to the extent that cash flow from operations is insufficient during any quarter because of temporary or seasonal fluctuations in percentage lease revenue  the company expects to utilize cash on hand or borrowings to make those distributions 
no assurance can be given that the company will make distributions in the future at the current rate  or at all
