item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  without limitation  those discussed in any documents incorporated herein by reference 
since its inception in july  the company has devoted substantially all of its resources to the discovery and development of its potential therapeutic products 
to date  the company has not received any revenues from the sale of products 
the company has funded its research and development primarily from equity derived working capital and through strategic alliances with other companies 
the company has been unprofitable since its inception and expects to incur substantial operating losses for the next several years 
as of december   the company s accumulated deficit was approximately million 
results of operations the company had total revenues of million for the year ended december   compared to million in and million in total revenues decreased million or in from and decreased million or in from  primarily attributable to a decline in research and development revenues 
revenues in each year consisted mainly of research and development revenues  which were million in  million in and million in research and development revenues for consisted of funding received under the company s collaborative research agreements with abbott and nextran  as well as a new collaboration with searle 
research grant revenues were million in  million in and million in the company had total operating expenses for the year ended december  of million  compared to million in  and million  excluding non recurring  non cash charges of million  in operating expenses decreased million or in from and increased million or in from the non recurring  non cash charges totaling million in were for acquired in process research and development relating to the acquisition of receptor laboratories  inc rli in july  and the acquisition of scripps minority interest in sequel therapeutics  inc in october both acquisitions were completed in exchange for cytel stock 
rli was sold in january research and development expenses decreased million or to million in from million in and increased million or to million in from million in the decrease in from was due to a continued company wide effort to control costs and a reduction in the number of clinical trials the company was conducting 
the increase in from reflects the increased costs associated with the company s clinical trials 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in and million in these decreases were primarily due to the company s cost reduction efforts during these periods 
net interest income was million in compared to million in and million in the decreases in compared to and compared to were primarily attributable to lower average cash balances 
the company expects to incur substantial operating losses over the next several years due to continuing and increasing expenses associated with its research and development programs  including preclinical testing and clinical trials 
operating losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of differences in the timing of revenues received and expenses incurred  and such fluctuations may be substantial 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed operations since inception primarily through private placements of its equity securities  two public common stock offerings  revenues under collaborative research and development agreements  grant revenues and interest income 
in september  searle  one of the company s research and development collaborators  made an equity investment in the company and the company s new subsidiary  epimmune  totaling million 
also in december  the company completed a private placement in which it received net proceeds of million 
through december  the company has raised approximately million from the sale of equity securities 
the company has financed its laboratory equipment and research and office facilities primarily through capital and operating lease arrangements 
the company had net working capital of million as of december  compared to million as of december  as of december   the company s cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments decreased to million from million at december  the decrease was due to an increase in cash used in operations that resulted from reduced research and development revenues from collaborators relative to expenditures for the development of the company s priority drug candidates and the company s research programs offset by the net proceeds from the sale of common stock 
capital expenditures  primarily for laboratory equipment  totaled million compared to million in the decrease was due primarily to the lower laboratory equipment expenditures required in as compared to the company s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are expected to decline primarily due to the continued clinical development of its therapeutic product candidates and the conduct of its research programs 
while the company s investments may periodically reflect unrealized losses  management attempts to schedule the maturities of the company s investments to coincide with the company s expected cash requirements 
the company expects to incur substantial additional research and development expenditures  including costs related to preclinical testing  clinical trials and manufacturing  as well as marketing and distribution expenses 
it is the company s intention to seek additional collaborative research and development relationships with suitable corporate partners 
there can be no assurance that any agreements that may result from these discussions will successfully reduce the company s funding requirements 
additional equity or debt financing will be required  and there can be no assurance that these funds will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate one or more of its drug discovery or development programs or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require the company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies  product candidates or products that the company would not otherwise relinquish 
if additional financing is not available  cytel anticipates its existing available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  investment income and research and development funding from collaborative agreements and research grants will be adequate to satisfy its capital requirements and fund operating losses through late the estimate for the period for which the company expects its available cash balances  investment income and estimated cash flow from collaborative agreements and research grants to be sufficient to meet its capital requirements is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties as set forth herein and elsewhere in this report on form k 
the company s future capital requirements depend on many factors  including continued scientific progress in its drug discovery programs  the magnitude of these programs  progress with preclinical testing and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  changes in the existing collaborative research relationships  the ability of the company to establish and maintain development arrangements  the cost of manufacturing scale up and effective commercialization activities and arrangements 
the company has determined that it will need to update some of its off the shelf financial applications software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and beyond 
the company currently expects the project to be substantially complete in early the cost is expected to be minimal and absorbed through normal operating costs of software maintenance contracts currently in place for these third party software products 
the project is not expected to have a significant effect on operations 
as is typical in the biotechnology industry  the commercial success of the company will depend in part on the company neither infringing patents issued to competitors nor breaching the technology licenses upon which the company s products might be based 
the company s business is also subject to other significant risks  including the uncertainties associated with the lengthy regulatory approval process and with potential competition from other products 
even if the company s products appear promising at an early stage of development  they may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
such reasons include  but are not limited to  the possibilities that the potential products will be found ineffective during clinical trials  failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals  be difficult to manufacture on a large scale  or be uneconomical to market
