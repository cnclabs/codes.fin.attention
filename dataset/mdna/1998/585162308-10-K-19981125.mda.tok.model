pec pec recognizes revenue primarily from sales of timeshare interests and land sales in resort areas  gain on sale of receivables and interest income 
pec periodically sells its consumer receivables while generally retaining the servicing rights 
revenue from sales of timeshare interests and land is recognized after the requisite rescission period has expired and at such time as the purchaser has paid at least of the sales price for sales of timeshare interests and of the sales price for land sales 
land sales typically meet these requirements within six to ten months of closing  and sales of timeshare interests typically meet these requirements at the time of sale 
the sales price  less a provision for cancellation  is recorded as revenue and the allocated cost related to such net revenue of the timeshare interest or land parcel is recorded as expense in the year that revenue is recognized 
when revenue related to land sales is recognized  the portion of the sales price attributable to uncompleted required improvements  if any  is deferred 
notes receivable with payment delinquencies of days or more have been considered in determining the allowance for cancellations 
cancellations occur when the note receivable is determined to be uncollectible and the related collateral  if any  has been recovered 
cancellation of a note receivable in the quarter the revenue is recognized is deemed to not represent a sale and is accounted for as a reversal of the revenue with an adjustment to cost of sales 
cancellation of a note receivable subsequent to the quarter the revenue was recognized is charged to the allowance for cancellations 
gain on sale of notes receivable includes the present value of the differential between contractual interest rates charged to borrowers on notes receivable sold by pec and the interest rates to be received by the purchasers of such notes receivable  after considering the effects of estimated prepayments and a normal servicing fee 
pec retains certain participations in cash flows from the sold notes receivable and generally retains the associated servicing rights 
pec generally sells its notes receivable at par value 
the present values of expected net cash flows from the sale of notes receivable are recorded at the time of sale as interest only receivables 
interest only receivables are amortized as a charge to income  as payments are received on the retained interest differential over the estimated life of the underlying notes receivable 
interest only receivables are recorded at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated fair value 
the expected cash flows used to determine the interest only receivables asset have been reduced for potential losses under recourse provisions of the sales agreements 
reserve for notes receivable sold with recourse represents pec s estimate of the fair value of its future credit losses to be incurred over the lives of the notes receivable in connection with the recourse provisions of the sales agreements and is shown separately as a liability in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
in discounting cash flows related to notes receivable sales  pec defers servicing income at an annual rate of and discounts cash flows on its sales at the rate it believes a purchaser would require as a rate of return 
earned servicing income is included under the caption of financial income 
the cash flows were discounted to present value using a discount rate of in each of fiscal years  and pec has developed its assumptions based on experience with its own portfolio  available market data and consultation with its financial advisors 
in determining expected cash flows  management considers economic conditions at the date of sale 
in subsequent periods  these estimates may be revised as necessary using the original discount rate  and any losses arising from prepayment and loss experience will be recognized as realized 
provision for cancellations relating to notes receivable is recorded as expense in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance at a level considered adequate to provide for anticipated losses resulting from customers failure to fulfill their obligations under the terms of their notes receivable 
pec records provision for cancellations at the time revenue is recognized  based on historical experience and current economic factors 
the related allowance for cancellations represents pec s estimate of the amount of the future credit losses to be incurred over the lives of the notes receivable 
the allowance for cancellations is reduced by actual cancellations experienced  including cancellations related to previously sold notes receivable which were reacquired pursuant to the recourse obligations discussed herein 
such allowance is also reduced to establish the separate liability for reserve for notes receivable sold with recourse 
pec s judgment in determining the adequacy of this allowance is based upon a periodic review of its portfolio of notes receivable 
these reviews take into consideration changes in the nature and level of the portfolio  current economic conditions which may affect the purchasers ability to pay  changes in collateral values  estimated value of inventory that may be reacquired and overall portfolio quality 
changes in the allowance as a result of such reviews are included in the provision for cancellations 
recourse to pec on sales of notes receivable is governed by the agreements between the purchasers and pec 
the reserve for notes receivable sold with recourse represents pec s estimate of the fair value of future credit losses to be incurred over the lives of the notes receivable 
a liability for reserve for notes receivable sold with recourse is established at the time of each sale based upon pec s estimate of the fair value of the future recourse obligation under each agreement of sale 
fees for servicing notes receivable originated or acquired by pec and sold with servicing rights retained are generally based on a stipulated percentage of the outstanding principal balance of such notes receivable and are recognized when earned 
interest received on notes receivable sold  less amounts paid to investors  is reported as financial income 
interest only receivables are amortized systematically to reduce notes receivable servicing income to an amount representing normal servicing income and the present value discount 
late charges and other miscellaneous income are recognized when collected 
costs to service notes receivable are recorded to expense as incurred 
interest income represents the interest received on loans held in pec s portfolio  the accretion of the discount on the interest only receivables and interest on cash funds 
total costs and expenses consist primarily of marketing and sales expenses  general and administrative expenses  direct costs of sales of timeshare interests and land  depreciation and amortization and interest expense 
marketing and sales costs directly attributable to unrecognized sales are accounted for as deferred selling costs until such time as the sale is recognized 
the company incurs a portion of operating expenses of the timeshare associations based on ownership of unsold timeshare interests at each of the respective timeshare properties 
these costs are referred to as association assessments and are included in the consolidated statements of operations under the caption of general and administrative expenses 
management fees received from the associations are included under the caption of other revenues 
these fees are not deemed to be the result of a separate revenue generating line of business since the management activities to which they relate are part of the support of the timeshare business and the fees are actually a reduction of the expense the company incurs to fulfill obligations regarding timeshares 
the following table sets forth certain data regarding notes receivable additions and servicing through sales of timeshare interests and land for the years ended august  principal balance of notes receivable additions   number of notes receivable additions  net of upgrades and downgrades   notes receivable serviced at end of period   land sales as of august  exclude million of sales not yet recognized under generally accepted accounting principles gaap since the requisite payment amounts have not yet been received 
if ultimately recognized  revenues from these sales would be reduced by a related provision for cancellations of million  estimated deferred selling costs of million and cost of sales of million 
real estate risk real estate development involves significant risks  including risks that suitable properties will not be available at reasonable prices  that acquisition  development and construction financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all  that infrastructure and construction costs may exceed original estimates  that construction may not be completed on schedule  and that upon completion of construction and improvements  properties may not be sold on favorable terms or at all 
in addition  pec s timeshare activities  as well as its ownership  improvement  subdivision and sale of land  are subject to comprehensive federal  state and local laws regulating environmental and health matters  protection of endangered species  water supplies  zoning  land development  land use  building design and construction and other matters 
such laws and difficulties in obtaining  or the failure to obtain  the requisite licenses  permits  allocations  authorizations and other entitlements pursuant to such laws can adversely impact the development and completion of pec s projects 
the enactment of slow growth or no growth initiatives in any area where pec sells land or timeshare interests could also delay or preclude entirely the development of such properties 
restatement and sec investigation as previously reported in the company s form k for the year ended august   form q for the three months ended may   and in prior reports  following the company s restatement of certain of its previously issued financial statements  including for the year ended august   upon which its auditors had rendered unqualified opinions  the securities and exchange commission sec commenced a formal investigation to determine  among other things  whether the company  and or its officers and directors  violated applicable federal securities laws in connection with the preparation and filing of the company s previously issued financial statements or certain of its common stock 
in a letter from the sec dated june   the company was advised that the staff inquiry had been terminated and that no enforcement action had been recommended to the sec 
in addition  the letter referred to securities act release which provides that such letter should not be construed to mean that any party has been exonerated or that no action may ultimately result from the staff s investigation 
certain payments and amortization of negative goodwill in connection with the assignment to the company in by affiliates of certain officers and directors of the company assignors of the right to acquire pec  the company became obligated to make quarterly payments to the assignors equal to of the cash balances of pec  during the year period ended january   that could be used to pay a dividend without violating pec s loan agreements 
accrual of amounts owed under such assignment agreement to the assignors ended on january   when their right to the accrual expired  at which time pec owed the assignors million 
on march   million of such amount was converted to subordinated debt 
see notes and of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
at the time of the acquisition of pec  the underlying book value of the net assets acquired exceeded the purchase price paid by the company by million  resulting in the creation of negative goodwill revaluation adjustment 
of this amount  million was not amortized but was instead reduced as additional payments were accrued to the assignors 
amounts accrued to the assignors in excess of million were expensed as such accruals were made 
the amortization of the remaining million of the revaluation adjustment was directly affected by the level of collections of the receivables of pec included in the acquired assets 
as proceeds of these receivables were collected  through installment payments or sale  a portion of the revaluation adjustment included as a contra account in notes receivable was recorded to income as amortization of negative goodwill  which amortization was completed at february  the company also amortized over a five year period ended in negative goodwill related to the excess of the underlying book value over the purchase price paid in for the acquisition of the minority interest of vacation spa resorts  inc vsr  formerly an owned subsidiary 
the consolidated financial statements of the company accordingly reflect amortization of a portion of the revaluation adjustment revaluation amortization  amortization of the negative goodwill associated with the acquisition of the vsr minority interest and accrual of payments to the assignors

pec s wholly owned utility subsidiary  cnuc  could also have problems with customer billings if not compliant 
certain operational aspects of pec could be affected by not being yk compliant  including elevator service at its resorts  telephone service and other essential utility services
