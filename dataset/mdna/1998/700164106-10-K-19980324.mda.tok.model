item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of this report contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the corporation intends such forward looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements contained in the private securities reform act of  and is including this statement for purposes of these safe harbor provisions 
forward looking statements  which are based on certain assumptions and describe future plans  strategies and expectations of the corporation  are generally identifiable by use of the words believe  expect  intend  anticipate  estimate  project  or similar expressions 
the corporation s ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain 
factors which could have a material adverse affect on the operations and future prospects of the corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary include  but are not limited to  changes in interest rates  general economic conditions  legislative regulatory provisions  monetary and fiscal policies of the us government  including policies of the us treasury and the federal reserve board  the quality or composition of the loan or investment portfolios  demand for loan products  deposit flows  competition  demand for financial services in the corporation s market area  and accounting principles  policies  and guidelines 
these risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements 
general the primary business of the company is the ownership of the bank 
the bank s results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on the bank s interest earning assets  such as loans and investments  and the interest expense on its interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
the bank also generates noninterest income such as income from real estate development activities and other fees 
the bank s noninterest expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits as well as occupancy expenses 
the bank s results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  government policies  and actions of regulatory agencies 
average statement of financial condition the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company s average statement of financial condition and reflects the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the years ended december    and the yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the years shown 
average balances are derived from average month end balances 
management does not believe that the use of average monthly balances instead of average daily balances has caused any material differences in the information presented 
average balances of loans receivable include loans on which the bank has discontinued accruing interest 
the yields and costs include fees which are considered adjustments to yields

net interest rate spread represents the difference between the yield on average interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
rate volume analysis the following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected the bank s interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated 
information is provided in each category with respect to i changes attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate  ii changes attributable to changes in rate changes in rate multiplied by prior volume  and iii the net change 
the changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate

comparison of financial condition at december  and december  total assets at december  were million compared to million at december   a decrease of million 
during  loans increased by million to million due to increased demand for fixed rate mortgage loans in the chicago market 
the increase in deposits and the decrease in securities were used to fund the loan growth  repay million of federal home loan bank advances  and complete to the repurchase of  shares of the company common stock 
total liabilities at december  were million compared to at december   an increase of million 
the increase is attributable to deposit growth of million and an increase in securities sold under repurchase agreements of million  offset by the repayment of federal home loan bank advances 
stockholders equity at december  was million compared to million at december   a decrease of million  due primarily to net income for the year offset by the repurchase of company common stock 
comparison of financial condition at december  and december  total assets at december  were million compared to million at december   an increase of million 
the increase in total assets is primarily attributable to the proceeds raised in the company s initial public offering of common stock 
the net proceeds of the stock offering were invested in securities which is reflected in the million increase in securities available for sale and the million increase in securities held to maturity 
during  loans increased by million due to increased demand for fixed rate mortgage loans in the chicago market 
the increases to securities and loans were partially offset by a million decrease in cash and cash equivalents which was primarily attributable to repayment of federal home loan bank advances and additional development costs associated with real estate development at prairie ridge 
total liabilities at december  were million compared to at december   a decrease of million 
the decrease is attributable to a million decrease in federal home loan bank advances and a decrease in deposits 
stockholders equity at december  was million compared to million at december   an increase of million  due primarily to net proceeds of the initial public offering that was completed on august  and the net income for the year 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and december  general net income increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  fiscal results were negatively affected by the  one time special assessment paid by the bank to recapitalize the savings association insurance fund saif as further discussed below 
interest income interest income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase in interest income was caused primarily by an increase in the average yield on securities  including mortgage backed securities 
the increase in average yield resulted from the investment in higher yielding investment and mortgage backed securities 
additionally  the average balance of loans outstanding increased by more than from interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
the increase in interest expense was primarily due to growth in the average balance of certificates of deposit and higher costs of federal home loan bank advances for the year ended december  provision for loan losses there was no provision for losses on loans for the years ended december  and the lack of provision is indicative of management s assessment that the allowance for loan losses is adequate  given the trends in historical loss experience of the portfolio and current economic conditions 
noninterest income noninterest income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
the increase was primarily attributable to increased sales volume of real estate held for development which generated a gain of  as compared to a gain of  for the year ended december  additionally  the company recognized a one time completion fee of  during on a land development loan 
service fee income decreased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  primarily due to a lesser amount of construction loans 
noninterest expense noninterest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of  the primary components attributable to the increase were increased compensation expense associated with the employee stock ownership plan esop and management retention plan mrp as well as other costs incurred as a result of operating as a public company 
the company also realized a decrease in federal deposit insurance costs due to a  special one time assessment to recapitalize the saif recorded in additionally  the insurance premium rate was reduced after this special assessment 
income taxes income tax expense was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  the increase in income tax expense was primarily the result of the increase in income before income taxes to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and december  general net income increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  fiscal results were negatively affected by the one time special assessment paid by the bank to recapitalize the savings association insurance fund saif as further discussed below 
prior to this charge  the earnings of the company were  due primarily to the growth in earning assets from to as a result of the company s conversion to a stock form of ownership during interest income interest income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  caused primarily by an increase in the average yield on securities and the investment of stock offering proceeds 
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
the increase in interest expense was primarily due to a higher rate paid on certificates of deposit 
provision for loan losses the bank s provision for losses on loans for the year ended december  was compared to  for the year ended december  the lack of provision is indicative of management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  given the trends in historical loss experience of the portfolio and current economic conditions 
noninterest income noninterest income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
the decrease was primarily attributable to the slowdown in sales volume of real estate held for development 
during the year ended december   six of the remaining nine lots were sold in the rose hill subdivision at a gain of  as compared to a gain of  for the year ended december  this decline was mitigated by an increase in service fee income from fees on deposit accounts which increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  noninterest expense noninterest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the primary factor attributable to the increase was a  special one time assessment to recapitalize the saif 
this assessment was charged to the bank during and was based upon a basis point charge on insured deposits outstanding as of march  income taxes income tax expense was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  the increase in income tax expense was primarily the result of the increase in income before income taxes from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources the bank s primary sources of funds are deposits  principal and interest payments on loans and securities  proceeds from the maturation of securities  fhlb advances  and securities sold under repurchase agreements 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions  and competition 
the bank maintains a liquidity ratio substantially above the regulatory requirement 
this requirement  which may be varied at the direction of the ots depending upon economic conditions and deposit flows  is based upon a percentage of deposits and short term borrowings 
the required ratio is currently 
the bank s average regulatory liquidity ratios were   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the bank s cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications cash flows from operating activities  investing activities  and financing activities 
cash flows provided by operating activities were   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
net cash from investing activities consisted primarily of disbursements for loan originations and the purchase of securities  offset by principal collections on loans  proceeds from maturation of investments and paydowns on mortgage backed securities  and the investment in and proceeds from the sale of real estate held for development 
net cash from financing activities consisted primarily of the activity in deposit accounts  fhlb borrowings  and securities sold under repurchase agreements in addition to the repurchase of company common stock in the net cash from financing activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
at december   the bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements with a tangible capital level of million or of adjusted total assets  which is above the required level of million or  core capital of million or of adjusted total assets  which is above the required level of million or  and risk based capital of million or of risk weighted assets  which is above the required level of million or 
the bank s most liquid assets are cash and short term investments 
the levels of these assets are dependent on the bank s operating  financing  lending  and investing activities during any given period 
at december   cash and short term investments totaled million 
the bank has other sources of liquidity if a need for additional funds arises  including securities maturing within one year and the repayment of loans 
the bank may also utilize fhlb advances or the sale of securities available for sale as a source of funds 
at december   the bank had outstanding commitments to originate mortgage loans of  compared to  at december  the bank anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan origination commitments 
certificate accounts which are scheduled to mature in less than one year from december  totaled million 
the bank expects that a substantial portion of the maturing certificate accounts will be retained by the bank at maturity 
however  if a substantial portion of these deposits are not retained  the bank may utilize federal home loan bank advances  or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts  which may result in higher levels of interest expense 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollar amounts without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the bank s operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the bank are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the bank s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
impact of new accounting standards statement of financial accounting standards no

sfas no 
requires companies to provide more descriptive disclosures about its operating segments including the way in which the segment was determined  the products and services provided by the segment  and the profit or loss generated by the segment 
management does not anticipate that sfas no 
will have a significant impact on the company s results of operations or capital 
year compliance a critical issue facing the financial institution industry is concerns over computer systems ability to process year date data beyond the year except in recently developed year compliant programs  computer programmers consistently have abbreviated dates by eliminating the first two digits of a year  with the assumption that these two digits would always be 
unless corrected  this situation is expected to cause widespread problems on january   when computer systems may recognize this date as january   and process data incorrectly or stop processing altogether 
this issue could affect a variety of the company s systems from its data processing system which records loan and deposit information to other ancillary systems such as alarms and locking devices 
management has considered this issue internally and receives periodic correspondence from its data processor regarding their plans to be year compliant 
management does not anticipate that the company will incur material operating expenses or be required to invest heavily in computer system improvements to be year compliant 
nevertheless  if not properly addressed  these issues could result in interruptions in the company s business and have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal objective of the bank s interest rate risk management function is to evaluate the interest rate risk included in certain balance sheet accounts  determine the level of risk appropriate given the bank s business focus  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements  and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with board approved guidelines 
through such management  the bank seeks to reduce the vulnerability of its operations to changes in interest rates 
the bank monitors its interest rate risk as such risk relates to its operating strategies 
the bank s executive committee meets regularly and reviews the bank s interest rate risk position and makes recommendations for adjusting such position 
in addition  the bank s board of directors reviews on a quarterly basis the bank s asset liability position  including simulations of the effect on the bank s capital of various interest rate scenarios 
the bank s interest rate sensitivity is monitored by management through the use of a model which estimates the change in net portfolio value npv over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts 
an npv ratio  in any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
the sensitivity measure is the decline in the npv ratio  in basis points  caused by a increase or decrease in rates  whichever produces a larger decline 
the higher an institution s sensitivity measure is  the greater its exposure to interest rate risk is considered to be 
the bank utilizes a market value model prepared by the ots the ots npv model  which is prepared quarterly  based on the bank s quarterly thrift financial reports filed with the ots 
the ots npv model measures the bank s interest rate risk by approximating the bank s npv  which is the net present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities  and any off balance sheet contracts  under various market interest rate scenarios which range from a basis point increase to a basis point decrease in market interest rates 
the interest rate risk policy of the bank provides that the maximum permissible change at a basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates is a change in the net portfolio value 
the ots has incorporated an interest rate risk component into its regulatory capital rule 
under the rule  an institution whose sensitivity measure exceeds would be required to deduct an interest rate risk component in calculating its total capital for purpose of the risk based capital requirement 
as of september   the bank s sensitivity measure  as measured by the ots  resulting from a basis point increase in interest rates was and would result in a million reduction in the npv of the bank 
accordingly  increases in interest rates would be expected to have a negative impact on the bank s operating results 
the npv ratio sensitivity measure is below the threshold at which the bank could be required to hold additional risk based capital under ots regulations 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv requires the making of certain assumptions that may tend to oversimplify the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
first  the models assume that the composition of the bank s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured 
second  the models assume that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
third  the model does not take into account the impact of the bank s business or strategic plans on the structure of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv measurement provides an indication of the bank s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurement is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the bank s net interest income and will differ from actual results 
the results of this modeling are monitored by management and presented to the board of directors  quarterly 
the following table shows the npv and projected change in the npv of the bank at december  assuming an instantaneous and sustained change in market interest rates of    and basis points
