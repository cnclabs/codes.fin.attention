item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company participates in floor plan arrangements with several major third party lenders on behalf of its dealers  most of who have financing arrangements with more than one lender 
except as described above  or where it has a direct repurchase agreement with a dealer  the company is under no material obligation to repurchase boats from its dealers 
from time to time the company will voluntarily repurchase a boat for the convenience of the dealer or for another dealer who needs a particular model not readily available from the factory 
the marketing of boats to retail customers is primarily the responsibility of the dealer  whose efforts are supplemented by the company through advertising in boating magazines and participation in regional  national  and international boat shows 
additionally  in order to further promote its products  the company developed a racing program to participate in the major classes of offshore powerboat races  many of which are regularly televised on programs such as espn 
additionally  fountain single  twin and triple engine racing boats currently hold their respective world speed records 
the result of these racing victories and world speed records has established the company s products as the highest performing and safest designed offshore boats 
the company believes that the favorable publicity generated by its performance programs contribute to its sales volume 
the company founder and ceo  reggie fountain  has raced a limited schedule since  and won numerous races in both factory and customer boats  he has also set numerous speed records in both factory and customer boats 
these fountain race boats were  in general  very successful in the various racing circuits in which they competed 
the company constructed two race boats during fiscal and implemented a racing program during fiscal  of which a major engine manufacturer is a sponsor 
in fiscal  the company completed the structure of its racing program with a third boat and captured several world speed records through the summer of calendar with the th victory completed by reggie fountain in new york city in september 
as part of the marketing program for its new line of sport fishing boats  the company sponsors several outstanding sport fishermen in the southern kingfish association s king mackerel tournaments 
this competitive circuit is held throughout the southeast 
in fiscal  the company s boats and sponsored fishermen dominated the tournaments by winning four of the top five spots 
one fountain fisherman  clayton kirby  was named angler of the year and finished in first place 
again  in fiscal  a fountain fisherman took first place 
fountain fishermen also won second place and of the top spots in fiscal since fiscal  the fountain fishing team has continued to place high in the final standings winning five of the last seven ska world championships 
the southern kingfish association s tournaments are held weekly and attract from one hundred to one thousand entrants with prizes ranging up to  the winning participation by fountain sport fishing boats has given them favorable exposure to serious sport fishermen  in particular with respect to the superior performance of fountain s fishing boat line 
sales order backlog 
the sales order backlog as of mid september was for approximately boats having an estimated sales value of  all of the backlog is generally shipped within months 
this compares to an equivalent backlog at this time in september and during the last year  the company s performance boats increase in sales value to a greater degree than fishing boats has increased the overall average unit price 
later this year  with the formal introduction of the new yacht  which has not been included in backlog numbers  the company believes that its average unit price and margins will increase significantly 
the company s fall dealer allocation program is designed to promote early replenishment of the stock in dealer inventories depleted throughout the prime spring and summer selling seasons 
product warranty 
the company warrants its boats against defects in material and workmanship for a period of three years 
the engine manufacturer warrants engines included in the boats 
warranty expenses of  were incurred in fiscal and were charged off against net income 
a reserve for warranty expenses estimated to be incurred in future years had been recorded and amounted to  at june  for  warranty costs were  or percent of sales 
warranty cost as a percentage of sales are among the lowest in the marine industry thereby reflecting the company s superior construction of its boats 
competition 
competition within the powerboat manufacturing industry is intense 
while the high performance sports boat market comprises only a small segment of all boats manufactured  the higher prices commanded by these boats make it a significant market in terms of total dollars spent 
the manufacturers that compete directly with the company in its market segment include wellcraft division of genmar industries  inc formula  a division of thunderbird products corporation cigarette racing team  inc baja boats  inc the company believes that in its market segment  speed  performance  quality  image  and safety are the main competitive factors  with styling and price being somewhat lesser considerations 
the market for fishing boats is much larger than the one for sport boats  but there are many more fishing boat manufacturers than there are sport boat manufacturers 
the company believes that its current owners  many whom have purchased multiple and increasingly larger boats from the company regenerate a ready waiting market for its expansion into the cruiser and yacht market 
employees 
as of september  the company had employees  of whom ten were executive and management personnel 
twenty three were engaged primarily in administrative positions including accounting  personnel  marketing and sales activities

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
as described more fully below at business environment  approximately half of the company s shipments to dealers were financed through so called floor plan arrangements with third party lenders pursuant to which the company may be required to repurchase boats repossessed by the lenders if the dealers defaults under his credit arrangement 
the other half of shipments was cod or payment prior to shipment 
generally  the company recognizes a sale when a boat is shipped to a customer  legal title and all other incidents of ownership have passed from the company to the customer  and payment is received from the customers third party commercial lender or from the customer 
this is the method of sales recognition believed to be in use by most boat manufacturers 
the company has developed criteria for determining whether a shipment should be recorded as a sale or as a deferred sale a balance sheet liability 
the criteria for recording a sale are that the boat has been completed and shipped to a customer  that title and all other incidents of ownership have passed to the customer  and that there is no direct commitment to repurchase the boat or to pay floor plan interest beyond the normal sales program terms 
at june   the company estimated the balances in deferred sales to be  and in deferred cost of sales to be  at june   the company estimated the balances in deferred sales to be  and in deferred cost of sales to be  the differences between the estimates for deferred sales and deferred cost of sales at june  and june  had the effect of increasing the gross margin on sales and net income after taxes for the year by  
per share 
at june   and  there were no commitments to dealers to pay the interest on floor plan financed boats in excess of the time period specified in the company s written sales program and there were no direct repurchase agreements 
this was because of much improved market conditions and strong ongoing consumer demand for boats 
therefore  there were no deferred sales or cost of sales estimated at june    and the differences between the estimates for deferred sales and deferred cost of sales at june  and june  had the effect of increasing the gross margin on sales and net income after taxes for the year by  there was no such effect on fiscal and the company has a contingent liability to repurchase boats where it participates in the floor plan financing made available to its dealers by third party finance companies 
sales to participating dealers are approved by the respective finance companies 
if a participating dealer does not satisfy its obligation to the lender and the boat is subsequently repossessed by the lender  then the company may be required to repurchase the boat 
the company had a contingent liability of approximately  at june    at june  and  at june  for the shipment of boats  which remained uncollected by the finance companies at those dates 
the lesser contingent liability at june  is due to fewer boats being floor planned by dealers with finance companies 
additionally  at june   and  the company had recorded reserves of   and  which represent losses which may be reasonably expected to be incurred on boat repurchases in future years 
business environment 
the company s sales have continued to increase each year 
sales for were  the sales volume for fiscal was in line with the stable environment in the overall recreational boating industry 
plant utilization stands at about until full production of the new yacht is achieved 
sales for fiscal were  a increase from sales for fiscal sales for fiscal were  in fiscal  the company continued to advertise and market aggressively 
management believes that the company s advertising  marketing  racing  and tournament fishing programs  as well as  its reputation as the builder of the highest quality  best performing  and safest high performance boats in the industry  all contributed in maintaining our performance market share 
typically  each dealer s floor plan credit facilities are secured by the dealer s inventory  and  perhaps  other personal and real property 
in connection with the dealers floor plan arrangements  the company as well as substantially all other major manufacturers has agreed in most instances to repurchases  under certain circumstances  any of its boats which a lender repossesses from a dealer and returns to the company 
in the event that a dealer defaults under credit line  the lender may invoke the manufacturers repurchase agreements with respect to that dealer 
in that event  all repurchase agreements of all manufacturers supplying a defaulting dealer are generally invoked regardless of the boat or boats with respect to which the dealer has defaulted 
except where there is a direct repurchase agreement with the customer  the company is under no obligation to repurchase boats from its dealers  although it will on occasion voluntarily assist a dealer in selling a boat or repurchase a boat for the convenience of a dealer 
no boats were repurchased in fiscal  and fiscal in connection with floor plan arrangements 
five boats were repurchased during fiscal in connection with floor plan arrangements 
at june  and  the company had recorded a  reserve for losses which may be reasonably expected to be incurred on boat repurchases in future years 
results of operations 
net income for fiscal was  or 
per share outstanding 
this compares to net income for fiscal of  or 
per share 
the change in net income was primarily due to a discontinued operations loss and write down of assets of a subsidiary  fountain power  inc for  in fiscal see note 
operating income decreased slightly from  in fiscal to  in fiscal income from continuing operations before the loss and write down due to fountain power  inc decreased primarily due the company s current tax liability in fiscal to  from  in fiscal net income for fiscal was up due to an improvement in sales volume  production efficiencies and a favorable sales mix 
also  income was bolstered by inclusion of a non recurring  discount earned for the early retirement of indebtedness to a vendor 
sales were  for fiscal  or up by from the previous year 
the company s gross profit margin as a percentage of sales changed slightly to in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal the change in the gross margin percentage was due to the overall sales mix of boats and production efficiencies 
depreciation expense was  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal depreciation expense by asset category was as follows fiscal fiscal fiscal land improvements    buildings    molds plugs    machinery equipment

management believes that advertising is necessary in order to maintain the company s sales volume and dealer base 
additionally  in an effort to further promote its products  the company continued its offshore racing and tournament fishing programs 
these programs cost  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal as previously noted  the company curtailed its offshore racing program in fiscal and sold its last remaining race boat  but continued a limited racing program and its tournament fishing program through fiscal the company commenced construction of two race boats during late fiscal and began a racing program during fiscal selling expenses compared for the past three fiscal years were as follows fiscal fiscal fiscal offshore racing and tournament fishing 
   advertising    salaries commissions 
   boat shows    dealer incentives    other selling expenses 
   total    general and administrative expenses include the finance  accounting  legal  personnel  data processing  and administrative operating expenses of the company 
these expenses were  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal most of the increase for fiscal over fiscal was in attorneys fees 
see item legal proceedings interest expense was  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal the increase in interest expense for fiscal was primarily due to an overall increase in loan debt from the fiscal consolidation loan from general electric capital corporation 
for fiscal  the company recorded  in racing participation fees  which reduced our overall program cost for the year 
included in other income for fiscal are consulting fees earned by the use of mr 
fountain amounting to  and these have been assigned to the company 
included in other income for fiscal is a non recurring  discount earned for the early retirement of indebtedness to a vendor 
also included in other income for fiscal are  of technical consulting fees earned by the company by the use of mr

under the terms of the consulting contract  the consulting fees ended entirely after fiscal liquidity and financial resources 
operations in fiscal provided  in cash 
net income plus depreciation expense provided cash amounting to  however  relatively large amounts were needed to finance investment activities in purchasing property  plant  equipment  inventory and molds 
in addition  the new yacht construction with associated development costs added to the heavy use of cash 
the ending cash balance was  operations for the prior fiscal year provided  in cash 
net income plus depreciation expense provided cash amounting to  however  relatively large amounts were needed to finance investment activities in purchasing property  plant  equipment and molds 
the loss from operations of the discontinued subsidiaries  fountain power  inc and mach performance  inc also contributed to the use of cash 
the ending cash balance was operations for the fiscal year provided  in cash

debt repayments to metlife capital corporation and others amounted to  the net decrease in cash for fiscal was  primarily due to the investment in facilities  equipment and molds 
during fiscal  the company borrowed the remaining  against the initial general electric capital corporation loan  bringing the balance to  less the scheduled monthly principal reductions 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company concluded negotiations for a new  promissory note with transamerica business credit corporation  which included restatement and amendment of certain existing promissory notes with general electric capital corporation 
for fiscal  the company anticipates that the  beginning cash balance along with the proceeds of the additional financing and net income from fiscal operations will be sufficient to meet most of the company s liquidity needs of the year 
the company intends to concentrate on developing the new yacht assembly line in fiscal effective december   the company concluded a new  term loan agreement with general electric capital corporation repaying previous indebtedness to metlife capital corporation  deutsche financial services and others 
at june   the total outstanding amount was  less scheduled monthly principal reductions 
effects of inflation 
the company has not been materially affected by the moderate inflation of recent years 
since most of the company s plant and its equipment are relatively new  expenditures for replacements are not expected to be a factor in the near term future 
when raw material costs increase because of inflation  the company attempts to minimize the effect of these increases by using alternative  less costly materials  or by finding less costly sources for the materials it uses 
when the foregoing measures are not possible  its selling prices are increased to recover the cost increases 
the company s products are targeted at the segment of the powerboat market where retail purchasers are generally less significantly affected by price or other economic conditions 
consequently  management believes that the impact of inflation on sales and the results of operations will not be material 
the year a current concern  known as the year or yk bug is expected to effect a large number of computer systems and software during or after the year the concern is that any computer function that requires a date calculation may produce errors 
the year issue affects virtually all companies and organizations  including the company 
the company plans on taking all steps necessary to prevent these errors from occurring 
with respect to third party providers whose services are critical to the company  the company intends to monitor the efforts of such vendors  as they become year compliant 
management is not presently aware of any year issues that have been encountered by any such third party  which could materially affect the company s operations 
at present  the company anticipates the costs of upgrading some of its software and hardware in order to avoid any problems resulting from the millennium bug will cost approximately  there is no assurance that the company will not experience operational difficulties as a result of year issues
