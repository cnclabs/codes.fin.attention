item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market sensitive instruments and risk management the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate changes 
the company does not hold or purchase any foreign currency or interest rate contracts for trading purposes 
the company s objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency changes is to reduce the risk to earnings and cash flow associated with foreign exchange rate changes 
as a result  the company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce risks associated with the value of its existing foreign currency assets  liabilities  firm commitments and anticipated foreign revenues and costs 
the gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset changes in the related exposures 
the company does not hedge its foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on the company s consolidated net income 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives  the company will periodically use interest rate contracts to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to its borrowings 
the company had no interest rate contracts outstanding at year end in the normal course of operations  the company also faces other risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable 
such risks principally include changes in economic or political conditions  other risks associated with foreign operations  commodity price risk and litigation risk which are not represented in the analyses that follow 
foreign exchange value at risk the company uses a value at risk var model to determine the estimated maximum potential one day loss in earnings associated with both its foreign exchange positions and contracts 
this approach assumes that market rates or prices for foreign exchange positions and contracts are normally distributed 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions 
firm commitments  receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge  were included in the model 
forecasted transactions  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge  were excluded from the model 
the var was estimated using a variance covariance methodology based on historical volatility for each currency 
the volatility and correlation used in the calculation were based on historical observations  using one year s data with equal weightings 
this data was obtained from the publicly available jp morgan riskmetrics data set on the internet 
a percent confidence level was used for a one day time horizon 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred by the company  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 
the estimated maximum potential one day loss in earnings for the company s foreign exchange positions and contracts would have been immaterial to the company s earnings 
interest rate sensitivity an assumed basis point move in interest rates percent of the company s weighted average floating rate interest rates affecting the company s variable rate borrowings would have had an immaterial effect on the company s earnings
