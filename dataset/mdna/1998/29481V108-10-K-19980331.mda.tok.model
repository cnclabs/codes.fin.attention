item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is a clinical research organization providing a broad range of integrated product development services on a global basis to its clients in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device industries 
the company s services include centralized core laboratory testing which includes diagnostic services that consist primarily of ecg reading and blood laboratory services  clinical trial management  clinical data management  bio statistical analysis  health care economics and outcomes research and regulatory affairs services 
in addition  the company develops  markets and supports clinical trial software products 
the company s centralized core laboratory services are on a fee for service basis and generally have terms from one month to two years 
a portion of the company s fee typically is paid upon contract execution as a non refundable up front payment  with the remaining amounts billed monthly 
clinical research service contracts are generally fixed priced  with certain variable components  and range in duration from a few months to two years 
a portion of the company s fee typically is paid upon contract execution as a non refundable up front payment  with the balance billed in accordance with the contract terms 
the company s contracts generally may be terminated with or without cause on to days notice 
clients terminate or delay contracts for a variety of reasons  including  among others  the failure of the product s being tested to satisfy safety or efficacy requirements  unexpected or undesired clinical results of the product  the client s decision to forego a particular study  insufficient patient enrollment or investigator recruitment  and production problems resulting in shortages of required supplies 
revenues from clinical trial software and services are derived primarily from software license fees and software maintenance and support services 
revenues from core laboratory service contracts generally are recognized on a per procedure basis as the work is performed 
for the years ended december   and  the core laboratory service revenues represented  and  respectively  of total net revenues 
revenues from clinical research service contracts generally are recognized on a percentage of completion basis as work is performed 
the company regularly subcontracts with third party investigators in connection with clinical trials and with other third party providers for specialized services 
these and other reimbursable costs are paid by the company and reimbursed by clients and  in accordance with industry practice  are included in revenues 
since reimbursed costs may vary significantly from contract to contract and are not meaningful for analyzing trends in revenues  they are included in gross revenues but excluded from net revenues 
revenues from clinical trial software licenses are recognized upon shipment of the software and related documentation and customer acceptance 
revenues from software maintenance and continuing support contracts are recognized on a straight line basis over the period in which the software maintenance and continuing support is provided 
revenues from consulting and training services are recognized when the services are performed 
consistent with industry practice  the company considers net revenues its primary measure of growth 
the company has had  and expects to continue to have  certain clients  which will generate at least of the company s overall revenue 
the company believes that such concentration of business is not uncommon in the clinical research industry 
the company s forward load backlog consists of anticipated core laboratory  clinical research and software net revenues from work under letters of intent and contracts that have been signed but not yet completed 
at december   the backlog was approximately million  including approximately million from dlb 
the company believes that its backlog as of any date is not necessarily a meaningful predictor of future results because backlog can be affected by a number of factors  including size and duration of contracts  some of which are performed over several years 
the company recognizes revenue over the duration of the contract as services are provided 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to fully realize all of its backlog as net revenues 
the company conducts operations on a global basis  with offices in the united states and united kingdom

results of operations year ended december   compared to the year ended december  net revenues decreased million or to million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in diagnostic service revenues for the year ended december  diagnostic service revenues primarily decreased as the result of several significant ecg contracts  which were ongoing in  being completed in early  with a low level of new ecg contracts initiated in partially offsetting the decrease in diagnostic service revenues  were increases in phase i revenues and clinical trial and data management revenues of million and million  respectively 
the increase in phase i revenues was the result of several large contracts that were conducted in the clinical trial and data management revenue growth was attributable to the company s increased service capabilities developed during revenues for the year ended december   were also increased by million in connection with a payment received in the first quarter for a licensing agreement termination

direct costs increased million or to million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenues  direct costs increased to in  compared to in the increase was primarily attributable to increased costs incurred in connection with the growth in phase i and clinical trial and data management revenues 
such costs increased 
million and million  respectively  and were comprised primarily of direct labor 
the direct costs associated with revenues from dlb accounted for million of the year to year increase 
partially offsetting these increases was a million decline in direct costs of diagnostic services from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  prior to  the company paid ecg reading analysis fees to a professional corporation owned by joel morganroth  md  the company s president and chief executive officer 
the company and dr

year ended december   compared to the year ended december  net revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase was directly attributable to a significant increase in the volume of diagnostic services 
diagnostic service revenues increased million or for the year ended december   compared to the prior year  and included an increase of million in the net revenues of the company s uk subsidiary 
offsetting the increase in diagnostic service revenues was a million decrease in canda revenues and a million decrease in phase i clinical trials revenues 
the decrease in canda revenues was due to fewer canda services being performed for clients during the year resulting from the company s larger pharmaceutical clients ability to perform such services in house and a reduced pressure to file candas stemming from a reduction in fda review time 
the company believes that the decrease in phase i revenues primarily was caused by a delay in the commencement of domestic phase i trials in as a result of certain consolidations occurring in the pharmaceutical industry 
the company believes that these factors are unlikely to cause a continuing decrease in phase i revenues  but that this business area is likely to experience slower growth than other sectors of its business 
direct costs increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenues  direct costs increased to in  compared to in the increase primarily was attributable to increased consulting fees paid to the company s president in connection with medical interpretations for diagnostic tests  in addition to general increases in connection with the increase in diagnostic services 
the consulting fees for medical interpretations increased from million in to million in the company and the president have entered into a new consulting agreement that discontinued such variable fees effective january  selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from in to in the dollar increase resulted from additional costs  primarily payroll  required to build the clinical trials management business 
the reduction as a percentage of net revenues was due to the relatively fixed nature of the expenses  the company s focus on monitoring support costs and efficiencies gained through increased volume 
depreciation and amortization decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenues  depreciation and amortization decreased from in to in the decrease primarily was the result of the company s continuing transition from more expensive mainframe computers to less expensive personal and server based computers 
the company s effective income tax rate for the year ended december   was  compared to for the year ended december  the rate decrease in was the result of a higher proportion of non deductible expenses as a percentage of net income in compared to liquidity and capital resources the clinical research industry generally is not capital intensive 
the company s principal cash needs relate to funding receivables as client payments generally lag to days after the invoice date 
the company historically has funded the increase in receivables through cash generated from operations 
in february  the company completed the initial public offering of its common stock  which resulted in proceeds from the offering  net of expenses  of million 
as of december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million 
the company generally places its investments in ap rated commercial bonds and paper  municipal securities and certificates of deposit with maturities of less than one year 
for the year ended december   the company used cash in operating activities of million compared to cash provided by operations of million during the year ended december  the decrease in operating cash flow was due primarily to the company s net loss of million  an increase in net deferred income tax assets of million and from changes in the working capital accounts  including a million increase in accounts receivable 
the above were partially offset by the million write off of in process research and development 
during the year ended december   the company purchased million of property and equipment and used million of the proceeds from the public offering to purchase short term investments 
on june   the company paid million to acquire a equity interest in dlb 
effective october   the company purchased substantially all of dlb s assets for an additional million plus the assumption of certain liabilities 
the total purchase price of dlb was million

at december   the company had no outstanding borrowings under the line 
the company expects that existing cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash flow from operations and borrowings under its line of credit will be sufficient to meet its foreseeable cash needs for at least the next year 
however  there may be acquisition and other growth opportunities that require additional external financing and the company may from time to time seek to obtain additional funds from the public or private issuances of equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance that such financings will be available or available on terms acceptable to the company 
recent events on february   the company entered into a non binding letter of intent to purchase substantially all of the assets  the ongoing business operations and assume certain liabilities of south florida kinetics  inc  doing business as south florida bioavailablitiy clinic sfbc 
the letter of intent was subject to various contingencies including due diligence by the company and execution and delivery of a definitive purchase agreement
