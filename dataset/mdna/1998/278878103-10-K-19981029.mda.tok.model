results of operations net revenues net revenues for fiscal year were million  up from the million reported in fiscal year the increase in net revenues was due primarily to an increase in sales recognized from the company s international clients and the united states federal government 
in page of particular  the company experienced substantial sales growth from its subsidiary in venezuela as that firm s net revenue nearly tripled versus last year as a result of continued growth with both governmental and domestic oil industry clients in south america 
the company also realized increased revenues in fiscal year from its start contracts with the epa and various contracts with the dod as these federal agencies issued an increased volume of work orders as compared to fiscal the company recently continued its business expansion in the federal government market 
in september  the company was awarded a five year environmental services contract with the united states air force reserve command worth up to million 
this contract is a task order contract and therefore the company is not guaranteed any portion of the million in work 
net revenues for fiscal year were million  down from the million reported in fiscal year the decrease in net revenues for fiscal year was due in large measure to a lack of funding early in fiscal year following the federal government budget crisis the previous year 
income before income taxes the company s income before income taxes for fiscal year was  up from the  recorded in the previous year 
this increase was primarily attributable to the aforementioned increase in net revenues 
the company also continued its success in stabilizing indirect operating costs as its percentage of these costs to net sales was slightly lower than the same ratio in fiscal year operating margins relating to the company s analytical services center asc partially offset the above favorable impacts on income before income taxes 
the operating loss derived from the asc in fiscal year increased over the prior year as the result of continued pricing pressures

this was partially offset by a decrease in tax exempt interest as a percentage of income 
year compliance many currently installed computer systems are not capable of distinguishing st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  in less than two years  computer systems and or software used by many companies in a wide variety of applications will experience operating difficulties unless they are modified or upgraded to adequately process information involving  related to or dependent upon the century change 
page of the company has completed its companywide assessment of operating and information systems which are sensitive to a potential year problem 
most of the systems currently in use were found to be compliant 
the company s internal financial systems software and its sample tracking software utilized at its analytical services center are not year compliant and are currently being replaced 
the financial systems software has been upgraded and implemented effective august  while the alternative packages of the new compliant sample tracking software are currently being evaluated and scheduled to be upgraded and replaced by june the cost of the company s year compliance upgrade is being funded from current operations and is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position or results of operations 
the company estimates the total cost of the upgrade to be between  the fact that the company offers labor oriented services minimizes its risk associated with potential year problems from its suppliers 
the company maintains a broad base of vendors and suppliers and believes there is little risk to its ongoing operations from year problems by its outside vendors 
there can be no guarantee that the company s customers  particularly the us government  will successfully complete a year upgrade on a timely basis 
because a majority of the company s business is contracted with various federal government agencies  a failure by the us government to achieve year compliance could have significant adverse effects on the company s future business  financial operations and results of operations 
based on the progress the company has made to date in addressing its year issues and the company s timeline for completing its compliance program  the company does not foresee significant risks associated with these efforts at this time 
since the company has adopted a plan to address these issues in a timely manner  it has not developed a comprehensive contingency plan should these issues fail to be completed successfully or in their entirety 
however  if the company identifies significant risks or is unable to meet its anticipated timeline  the company will develop contingency plans as deemed necessary at that time
