impact of the year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
based on representations made by the company s business software systems vendor  the company believes that its business software system is year compliant 
however  the company has not yet initiated formal testing of its business software system and has not yet engaged in formal communications with all of its significant suppliers and large customers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issue 
however  as the company s computer system does not currently interact with those of its major suppliers and customers  it is not expected that the year issue would have a material impact on the company s future operating results or financial condition
