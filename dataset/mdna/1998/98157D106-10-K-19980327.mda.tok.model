the following discussion and analysis relates to the financial condition and results of operations of the company for the three years ended december  this information should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this document 
general the company is one of the largest long distance telecommunications companies in the united states  serving local  long distance and internet customers domestically and internationally 
the company s operations have grown significantly in each year of its operations as a result of internal growth  the selective acquisition of smaller long distance companies with limited geographic service areas and market shares  the consolidation of certain third tier long distance carriers with larger market shares  and international expansion 
on january   worldcom  through a wholly owned subsidiary  merged with compuserve 
prior to the compuserve merger  compuserve operated primarily through two divisions interactive services and network services 
interactive services offered worldwide online and internet access services for consumers  while network services provided worldwide network access  management and applications  and internet service to businesses 
the compuserve merger is being accounted for as a purchase  accordingly  operating results for compuserve will be included from the date of acquisition 
on january   worldcom also acquired ans from aol  and has entered into five year contracts with aol under which worldcom and its subsidiaries will provide network services to aol collectively  the aol transaction 
as part of the aol transaction  aol acquired compuserve s interactive services division and received a million cash payment from worldcom 
worldcom retained the compuserve network services cns division 
ans provides internet access to aol and aol s subscribers in the united states  canada  the united kingdom  sweden and japan  and also designs  develops and operates high performance wide area networks for business  research  education and governmental organizations 
in connection with the compuserve merger and the aol transaction  a valuation analysis was performed of cns and ans technologies including the companies virtual private data networks  application hosting products  security systems  next generation network architectures  and certain other identified research and development projects purchased in the compuserve merger and aol transaction 
the result of the valuation is the assignment of million of intangible assets to in process research and development which will be expensed in the first quarter of on january   worldcom through a wholly owned subsidiary  merged with bfp 
bfp is a leading facilities based provider of competitive local telecommunications services  commonly referred to as a competitive local exchange carrier clec  in selected cities within the united states 
bfp acquires and constructs its own state of the art fiber optic networks and facilities and leases network capacity from others to provide ixcs  isps  wireless carriers and business  government and institutional end users with an alternative to the ilecs for a broad array of high quality voice  data  video transport and other telecommunications services 
on november   worldcom entered into an agreement and plan of merger the mci worldcom merger agreement with mci communications corporation mci and a wholly owned acquisition subsidiary of worldcom mci merger sub  providing for the merger the mci worldcom merger of mci with and into mci merger sub  with mci merger sub surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of worldcom 
subject to the terms and conditions of the mci worldcom merger agreement  each share of mci common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the mci worldcom merger the mci worldcom effective time will be converted into the right to receive that number of shares of worldcom common stock equal to the mci exchange ratio as defined below  and each share of mci class a common stock  par value 
per share mci class a common stock and  together with the mci common stock  the mci capital stock  outstanding immediately prior to the mci worldcom effective time will be converted into the right to receive in cash  without interest thereon 
the mci exchange ratio means the quotient rounded to the nearest  determined by dividing by the average of the high and low sales prices of worldcom common stock the mci worldcom average price as reported on the nasdaq national market on each of the consecutive trading days ending with the third trading day immediately preceding the mci worldcom effective time  provided  however  that the mci exchange ratio will not be less than or greater than 
cash will be paid in lieu of the issuance of any fractional share of worldcom common stock in the mci worldcom merger 
based on the number of shares of mci common stock outstanding as of january  and assumed mci exchange ratios of and  approximately  shares and  shares  respectively  of worldcom common stock would be issued in the mci worldcom merger 
in addition  as of december   outstanding options to purchase shares of mci common stock would be converted in the mci worldcom merger to options to acquire an aggregate of approximately  shares and  shares  respectively  of worldcom common stock  and the exercise price would be adjusted to reflect the mci exchange ratio  so that  on exercise  the holders would receive  in the aggregate  the same number of shares of worldcom common stock as they would have received had they exercised prior to the mci worldcom merger  at the same exercise price 
the mci worldcom merger was approved by the mci stockholders and the worldcom shareholders at separate meetings held on march  the mci worldcom merger is also subject to approvals from the fcc  the doj and various state government bodies 
in addition  the mci worldcom merger is subject to approval by the european commission 
worldcom anticipates that the mci worldcom merger will close in mid year termination of the mci worldcom merger agreement by mci or worldcom under certain conditions will require mci to pay worldcom million as a termination fee and to reimburse worldcom the million alternative transaction fee and certain related expenses paid by worldcom to bt 
further  termination of the mci worldcom merger agreement by mci or worldcom under certain conditions  will require worldcom to pay mci billion as a termination fee 
pursuant to an agreement the bt agreement among mci  worldcom and bt  the prior merger agreement between bt and mci the bt mci merger agreement was terminated  and worldcom agreed to pay bt an alternative transaction fee of million and expenses of million payable to bt in accordance with the bt mci merger agreement 
these fees were paid on november  worldcom also agreed to pay to bt an additional payment of million in the event that worldcom is required to make the billion payment to mci in accordance with the mci worldcom merger agreement 
in addition  pursuant to the bt agreement  bt voted or caused to be voted its shares of mci class a common stock in favor of the mci worldcom merger agreement and the approval of the other transactions contemplated by the mci worldcom merger agreement 
worldcom is in the process of developing its plan to integrate the operations of mci which may include certain exit costs 
as a result of this plan  a charge  which may be material but which cannot now be quantified  is expected to be recognized in the period in which such a restructuring occurs 
worldcom has also undertaken a study to determine the allocation of the total purchase price to the various assets to be acquired  including in process research and development  and the liabilities assumed 
to the extent that a portion of the purchase price is allocated to in process research and development projects of mci  a charge  which may be material  would be recognized in the period in which the mci worldcom merger occurs 
on december   worldcom  through a wholly owned subsidiary  merged with mfs 
through this purchase  the company acquired local network access facilities via digital fiber optic cable networks installed in and around major united states cities  and in several major european cities 
the company also acquired a network platform  which consists of company owned transmission and switching facilities  and network capacity leased from other carriers primarily in the united states and western europe 
on august   mfs completed the uunet acquisition 
uunet is a leading worldwide provider of a comprehensive range of internet access options  applications  and consulting services to businesses  professionals and online services providers 
on january   the company completed the wiltel acquisition for approximately billion in cash 
through this purchase  the company acquired a nationwide common carrier network of approximately  miles of fiber optic cable and digital microwave facilities 
the company s strategy is to become a fully integrated communications company that would be well positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities in global telecommunications 
consistent with this strategy  the company believes that transactions such as the compuserve merger  the aol transaction  the bfp merger and  if consummated  the mci worldcom merger enhance the combined entity s opportunities for future growth  create a stronger competitor in the changing telecommunications industry  allow provision of end to end bundled service over global networks  and provide the opportunity for significant cost savings and operating efficiencies for the combined organization 
the company s profitability is dependent upon  among other things  its ability to achieve line costs that are less than its revenues 
the principal components of line costs are access charges and transport charges and the most significant portion of the company s line costs is access charges  which are highly regulated 
the fcc revised its rules regarding access charges in a manner that will  over time  revamp the access rate element structure and  over the near term  reduce the overall access revenues collected by the incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs 
the fcc s rate element restructuring is intended to align costs with the manner in which they are incurred by the ilecs 
as a result  the usage based system has been replaced with a system composed of a combination of flat rate charges and usage based charges 
the fcc has also implemented subsidy systems for local telephone services and services to schools  libraries  and hospitals 
the subsidy systems will result in additional charges being placed on all telecommunications providers  which charges may be directly recovered from the end users 
in addition  various state regulatory agencies are considering adoption of subsidy systems that could cause rate adjustments to the access services obtained by the company and to retail rates 
the company cannot predict what effect continued regulation and increased competition between lecs and other ixcs will have on future access charges or the company s business 
however  the company believes that it will be able to continue to reduce transport costs through effective utilization of its network  favorable contracts with carriers and network efficiencies made possible as a result of expansion of the company s customer base by acquisitions and internal growth

in spite of the continuing impact of competitive pricing and access charge pass throughs  the company posted strong gains across all product lines due to increased usage and greater demand for high speed data and internet related growth 
the following table highlights the source of worldcom s internal growth by major line of business 
the pro forma and actual revenue increases for and reflect the following increases by category dollars in millions twelve months ended december  actual pro forma revenues change domestic switched   domestic private line   international internet core revenues   other total revenues   the following discusses the results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to pro forma results for the comparable prior year period 
changes in actual results of operations are shown in the consolidated statements of operations and the foregoing tables and  as noted above  primarily reflect the mfs merger and the internal growth of the company 
domestic switched services revenue increased for the year 
this increase was primarily due to strong volume gains in both the retail and wholesale segments 
worldcom s narrowing gap between revenue and volume growth continues to be driven by strong wholesale revenues  international settlement reduction pass throughs  access charge pass throughs  and product mix 
domestic switched revenues includes both long distance and increasingly local switched revenues 
while the company continues to show significant percentage gains in switched local  it is still a relatively small component of total company revenues 
however  the company expects that due to its local initiatives  the bfp merger and  if consummated  the mci worldcom merger  revenue attributable to local switched services will grow rapidly in and beyond 
domestic private line increased by for the year 
the strong revenue growth for private line and frame relay continues to be driven by tremendous commercial end user demand for high speed data and by internet related growth 
domestic private line includes both long distance and local bandwidth sales 
as of december   and including bfp  the company has million voice grade equivalents  and  connected buildings 
route miles of connected fiber are in excess of  the bfp merger and the combination of mci into worldcom s operations are expected to enhance worldcom s local presence 
international revenues those revenues originating outside of the us were million  for the year  up compared with the corresponding pro forma period for this strong performance is due to continuing strong traffic growth in the united kingdom and a growing presence in continental europe for both switched services and  increasingly  high speed data services 
significant effort was taken in to prepare for the opening of national markets in european countries which should provide additional growth and improved margins in internet revenues for the year more than doubled to million 
the provisioning constraints experienced in mid were significantly overcome in the latter part of the third quarter  and the strong demand for both dedicated and dial up access contributed to the resumption of strong sequential gains in the fourth quarter 
other revenues for were million 
other revenues include network construction and system sales which each represent non recurring contract revenue streams that fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
operator services and broadcast operations were sold in the third quarter the operator services and broadcast operations provided revenues of million in and million in line costs as a percentage of revenues for was as compared to reported for the same period of the prior year and pro forma for these decreases are attributable to changes in the product mix and synergies and economies of scale resulting from network efficiencies achieved from the assimilation of mfs into the company s operations

depreciation and amortization expense for increased to million or of revenues from million or of revenues for this increase reflects increased amortization associated with the mfs merger and additional depreciation related to capital expenditures 
the effective income tax rate for was of income before taxes 
the rate of is greater than the expected statutory rate of primarily due to the fact that amortization of the goodwill related to the mfs merger is not deductible for tax purposes 
excluding the nondeductible amortization of goodwill  the company s effective income tax rate would have been 
for the year ended december   interest expense was million or of revenues  as compared to million or of revenues for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense is attributable to higher debt levels as the result of additional debt acquired with the mfs merger  higher capital expenditures and the fixed rate debt financings  offset by lower interest rates in effect on the company s variable rate long term debt

depreciation and amortization expense for decreased to million or of revenues from million or of revenues for this decrease reflects the reduction in depreciation and amortization associated with the second quarter write down in the carrying value of certain assets offset by additional depreciation related to capital expenditures 
the reduction in percentage is due to a relatively stable amount of amortization on a higher revenue base 
in the second quarter of  the company incurred non cash charges related to a write down in the carrying value of certain assets  including goodwill and equipment 
because of events resulting from the passage of the telecom act  and changes in circumstances impacting certain non core operations  management estimates of the company s fair value of operating assets within its core and non core businesses resulted in a non cash charge of million after tax 
on a pre tax basis  the write down was million and included million for network facilities and million for non core businesses  primarily operator services goodwill

on a pre tax basis  this charge was million and is reflected in operating loss for the period 
the results for include a billion  fourth quarter charge for in process research and development related to the mfs merger 
the charge is based upon a valuation analysis of the technologies of mfs worldwide information system  the internet network expansion system of uunet  and certain other identified research and development projects purchased in the merger 
the efforts to complete these projects will consist of internally staffed engineering costs and further development and construction of the network 
as of december   these costs were estimated to be approximately billion and will be incurred over the next five years

additionally  worldcom has paid bt a fee of million to induce bt to terminate the previously signed bt mci merger agreement and to enter into the bt agreement 
worldcom expects to fund this commitment through a combination of bank and bond financing 
the mci worldcom merger is expected to close by mid year  and therefore funding of this commitment is not expected to occur until the second half of increases in interest rates on worldcom s debt would have an adverse effect upon worldcom s reported net income and cash flow 
worldcom believes that the combined operations of worldcom  cns  ans  bfp and  upon consummation of the mci worldcom merger  mci  would generate sufficient cash flow to service worldcom s debt and capital requirements  however  economic downturns  increased interest rates and other adverse developments  including factors beyond worldcom s control  could impair its ability to service its indebtedness 
in addition  the cash flow required to service worldcom s debt may reduce its ability to fund internal growth  additional acquisitions and capital improvements 
the company has historically utilized cash flow from operations to finance capital expenditures and a mixture of cash flow  debt and stock to finance acquisitions

the company believes that the compuserve merger and the aol transaction will generate sufficient cash flow to adequately fund the capital requirements of these businesses 
additionally  management believes that the bfp merger will accelerate worldcom s local city development plans by one to two years 
therefore  the bfp merger is expected to result in a reduction in worldcom s previously expected capital spending for local city development 
as a result of the compuserve merger  the aol transaction  the bfp merger and  if consummated  the mci worldcom merger  the company believes that the operating and capital synergies from the integration of these acquisitions into worldcom s operations will further enhance the cash flow contribution for the company 
absent significant capital requirements for other acquisitions  the company believes that cash flow from operations and available liquidity  including billion under its new credit facilities  and funds anticipated to be received from debt to be issued under the shelf registration statements will be more than adequate to meet the company s capital needs for the remainder of recently issued accounting standards and year issues in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no

at december   marketable equity securities of the company were recorded at a fair value of million 
the fair value of marketable equity securities is based on quoted market prices 
the marketable equity securities held by the company have exposure to price risk  which is estimated as the potential loss in fair value due to a hypothetical percent adverse change in quoted market prices  and would amount to a decrease in the recorded value of marketable equity securities of approximately million
