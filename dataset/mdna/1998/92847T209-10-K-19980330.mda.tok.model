item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained herein 
recent developments the company has historically been engaged in designing and manufacturing precision acoustical and vibration instrumentation 
beginning in and continuing to the present  the company has acquired the rights to a number of core technologies and has dedicated significant time  effort  and expense to a research and development effort to create products designed for the scientific instrumentation industry 
in november  the board of directors appointed andrew c 
bebbington as new chief executive officer of the company 
the board believes that the new chief executive officer can reverse the severe losses of the company through a combination of restructuring and redirection of priorities and can lead the company into the next stage of its development  the finalization of products  establishment of standardized manufacturing  and market penetration for existing and developing products 
in connection with the appointment of mr 
bebbington  brian g 
larson  a co founder of the company and the former chief executive officer  resigned 
in addition  larry j 
davis  a co founder of the company and the vice president of product development  and dan j 
johnson  a vice president and former chief financial officer of the company also resigned 
each of the former executives also resigned their position on the board of directors of the company 
in connection with their resignations  these former executives entered into termination agreements with the company  in lieu of cancellation of their employment agreements  which provided for  among other things  the issuance of an aggregate of  shares of common stock  the surrender of options to acquire an aggregate of  shares of common stock at prices ranging from to per share  and three months of severance pay 
mr 
larson and mr 
johnson provided consulting services to the company and the new chief executive officer for a day transition period following their resignations  and mr 
davis has entered into an employment arrangement with the company to provide his services as a scientist and engineer in connection with the ongoing development of the company s technologies 
mr 
bebbington  with the strong endorsement of the outside board members  immediately undertook an evaluation of all aspects of the company s operations  research and development projects  sales and marketing approaches  product offerings  personnel and management  contractual arrangements  and overall cost structure 
as a result  the new chief executive officer recommended and the board of directors approved in december additional restructuring steps and certain changes in the strategic direction of the company 
this resulted in a reduction of personnel  the cessation of certain peripheral business activities  a renewed focus on certain research and development projects  and a de emphasis or abandonment of other projects 
these restructuring activities and certain other events in the fourth quarter of have resulted in unusual and nonrecurring charges to the statement of operations for the year ended december  in the aggregate amount of  see note b to the consolidated financial statements 
largely as a result of the change in strategic direction  certain inventories have been rendered obsolete or overstocked 
accordingly  a write down of inventory in the amount of  was recognized in the fourth quarter of in addition  the company recognized other adjustments and significant expenses in the fourth quarter of the most significant of these related to increases in the estimated provision for warranty work  adjustments to inventories related to the absorption of labor and overhead into cost of sales  and the reversal of the sales revenue for two instruments pending final acceptance by the customer 
other material expenses recorded in the fourth quarter in excess of normal operating expenses include significant costs incurred towards the development of the tofms and the sfc products and costs associated with the recruitment and relocation of the new chief executive officer 
overview over the course of the last four years  the company has acquired the rights to a number of technologies from brigham young university byu  either directly from byu or indirectly through its acquisition of sensar 
these technologies have placed the company in a position to develop a number of sophisticated analytical instruments in addition to its historical acoustical and vibration based business 
the company has also entered into a license agreement with lucent technologies  inc formerly bell labs  in which it acquired the sole rights to technology developed by lucent 
in order to accomplish its goals  the company initiated research and development plans designed to convert the underlying technologies into commercial products 
the company currently has one commercial product available based on these acquired technologies  its time of flight mass spectrometer tof and has just introduced beta models of its jaguar mass spectrometer and its sfc instrument 
in addition  the company continues to introduce acoustic and vibration products and has made significant advances toward additional products 
however  there have been unanticipated delays in the finalization of many of these products 
the company has just recently begun commercial production of its model analyzer and does not expect commercial production of the jaguar product until the second quarter of  both of which were originally scheduled for the first quarter of the company does not anticipate that there will be a significant impact on its revenues until after these and other products the company is working on have been introduced and have established market acceptance 
while management of the company continues to believe  and is committed to  develop a range of superior products designed to meet the needs of significant markets  the products currently being developed by the company are designed for sophisticated applications  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its development and marketing efforts or that alternative technologies may not be developed by some other entity that provide a more advantageous solution to the needs of the various industries targeted by the company 
if the company is unable to successfully develop the targeted products or the development of such products continues to be delayed  the company s ability to obtain the necessary financing to continue its research and development program may be adversely affected 
the company is presently unable to fund its increased research  development  and other activities from operations and has sought and obtained equity financing  primarily from private placements to a small number of private investors  in order to meet these costs 
this capital has been and is currently being used for various purposes  including further research and development activities  costs associated with the market introduction of new key products  and general operations 
the most recent equity placement by the company was for gross proceeds of million completed in february assuming that the company can successfully launch its proposed new products and that they are sufficiently accepted in the market to permit a substantial increase in the company s revenues during  the company would anticipate that the proceeds from this private placement will provide adequate capital to meet its projected requirements through the end of fiscal but in the event that such products do not produce significant increases in revenues during  the company will continue to be reliant on obtaining outside financing to fund its operations in if this is the case  there can be no assurance as to the company s ability to obtain such financing or  if available  that such financing can be obtained on terms favorable to the company 
results of operations comparison of years ended december   and the company changed its fiscal year end from june to december  effective december  the company s audited financial statements cover the six months ended december   and the year ended june  financial information for the year ended december   is unaudited and has been derived from these two periods and is presented for comparative purposes only 
net sales net sales for the years ended december   and  were  and  respectively 
this represents a decrease of  or  for as compared to the overall decrease is principally the result of a decrease in sales in the acoustical and vibration product families 
sales of acoustical and vibration products for the year ended december   reflect decreases from last year primarily due to the delayed introduction of certain new products 
the company originally anticipated that these new acoustical products would be available at the beginning of the introduction of the company s model and dsp series products have only recently begun shipping and the introduction of the model and associated options have been delayed with volume shipments starting in the first quarter of in the interim  sales of the company s prior products declined 
management expects that these recent introductions will cause acoustical and vibration product sales to return to and exceed historical levels  although no assurance can be made that such expectation will be realized 
current year revenue from the company s chemical analysis instruments was approximately the same as in the prior year 
the company currently markets its tof to the semi conductor industry through saes 
under the terms of the marketing agreement  saes was obligated to sell a minimum of nine units in in order to maintain its exclusive rights  a target that was not met 
sales of the tof through saes have historically been hampered by the parties inability to mutually agree on acceptable performance standards for the instrumentation and the company has had difficulty in meeting certain heightened specifications required by certain new end users 
however  the most recent instruments shipped by the company to saes customers have been and are being subjected to extensive testing under the supervision of saes and others  and the company believes that many of the open specification issues have been or are being resolved 
at december   the company has reversed revenue recognition in the amount of approximately  on two units pending resolution of certain issues and subsequent customer acceptance shipped and that was originally recognized in the third quarter 
during the year ended december   export sales represented of net sales compared to for the year ended december  the company s export sales are billed  collected  and denominated in us dollars  other than its sales through its subsidiary  ltd  which are in british pounds sterling 
the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments has not historically been significant  aggregating approximately  at december  the company does not consider its foreign currency risks to be significant and has not taken a position in the currency markets or derivatives in an attempt to hedge any risk that might exist 
cost of sales cost of sales for the year ended december  was  or of net sales  compared to  or of net sales for the year ended december  the increase in of cost of sales as a percentage of net sales is due to a variety of significant factors  including the absorption of higher fixed manufacturing expenses and personnel costs on decreased acoustic and vibration sales in  costs related to meeting heightened specifications of the tof product  as well as certain other provisions  increases in estimated provisions for excess and obsolete inventories  principally associated with the restructuring of operations and changes in strategic direction of the company  and increases in the company s estimated provisions for warranty work 
the company anticipates that as the manufacturing process of its new products becomes standardized  costs of goods sold as a percentage of net sales will return to levels 
however  such a result will depend on the company s ability to standardize the manufacturing process and control costs for its newly developed products  for which no assurance can be given 
selling  general  and administrative selling  general  and administrative expenses increased to  or of net sales  for the year ended december   compared to  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the increase in the dollar amount of selling  general  and administrative expenses was due to several factors  including increased costs associated with the pursuit of strategic marketing and research alliances  costs associated with the implementation of a new electronic data processing system  costs associated with holding a stockholders meeting in  including the preparation of the annual report and proxy statement  and increased costs associated with other corporate and marketing activities 
the increase is also due to the company incurring costs  including the cost of additional employees necessary to establish the infrastructure to support the company s anticipated growth  and the recruitment and relocation costs of the new chief executive officer 
the new chief executive officer has implemented certain cost control procedures  reduced overhead  and restructured operations to reduce nonessential spending in this area 
however  it is not anticipated that selling  general  and administrative expenses can be reduced to an acceptable percentage of revenues unless and until sales increase substantially 
such increase is dependent on the successful introduction of new products and increased product demand for both new and existing products  which is the company s highest priority 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in accomplishing such goals 
research and development research and development expenses increased to  or of net sales  for the year ended december   compared to  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the increase in the amount of research and development expenses over the prior period  as well as over historical levels  is due to the company s continuing commitment to the research and development of new products from technologies acquired in recent years 
the increased expenses principally relate to the employment of additional scientists and engineers  costs associated with materials and supplies used in the prototype development process  and services from outside professionals 
the new chief executive officer has implemented certain cost control procedures  reduced overhead  and restructured operations to reduce nonessential spending in this area 
however  it is anticipated that research and development costs will continue to exceed historical levels as a percentage of net sales at least until the development of new products is completed and significant sales levels of the new products are achieved 
historical levels of research and development costs as a percentage of sales for the fiscal years ended june  to  averaged approximately of sales 
unusual and nonrecurring charges during the fourth quarter of  the company recognized unusual and nonrecurring charges in the amount of  the charges relate to restructuring charges of  associated with the termination of former management and employees  exit costs for certain activities  and the write down of assets as a result of changes in strategic direction of the company 
for a further description of the restructuring activities  see the discussion under recent developments above 
the company also recognized impairment losses of  in the fourth quarter of  related to the write down of the carrying value of certain assets 
see note b to the consolidated financial statements 
non cash portions of the unusual and nonrecurring charges were approximately  comparison of six months ended december   and net sales net sales from continuing operations for the six months ended december   and  were  and  respectively 
this represents an increase of  or  for as compared to the acquisition of sensar occurred october  as such  the operations of sensar are included for the entire six month period ended december   while the operations of sensar were only included for approximately two months of the six month period ended december  the increase in sales is principally due to increased revenue from sensar products of approximately during the six months ended december   export sales experienced a significant increase as a percentage of total sales  to of sales 
this growth was due to a continuing increase in sales to the pacific rim and increases in sales in europe  compared to the prior period 
domestic sales  on an annualized basis  declined compared to the prior year  but have increased compared to and cost of sales cost of sales for the six months ended december   were  or of net sales  compared to  or of sales  for the six months ended december  this elevated level of cost compared to historical levels continues principally due to high cost of materials  initial production costs  and development costs associated with production of initial sensar products 
selling  general  and administrative selling  general  and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales from for the six months ended december   to for the corresponding period of the increase was due to several factors  including increased audit  legal  and consulting fees  establishment of a new european sales manager  and increased costs related to various corporate and marketing activities 
research and development for the six months ended december   research and development costs were  or of net sales  compared to  or of net sales  for the six months ended december  the increase over the prior period  as well as increases above historical levels  is reflective of the company s continuing commitment to the development of new products 
comparison of years ended june   and net sales net sales from continuing operations for the fiscal years ended june   and  were  and  respectively 
this represents an approximate increase in its acoustic and vibration instrumentation sales 
the increased sales were attributable to a general expansion of the underlying market  and an increase in the unit sales of the company s products 
the acquisition of sensar on october   did not materially impact the net sales for the year ended june   with approximately  in revenue attributable to the sensar operations during that period 
during  export sales declined from to of total sales 
this decline was the result of decreased sales in europe  but was also due to strong sales increases domestically 
cost of sales and operating expenses the company s cost of sales and operating expenses of  in the year ended june   and  in the year ended june   increased as a percentage of sales from continuing operations to from 
the increase in was due primarily to the high cost of materials  initial production costs  and development costs associated with production of initial sensar products 
prior to the company s acquisition  sensar purchased major electronics subsystems from a third party 
the pricing structure was based on the premise of a high price for a limited number of systems to provide the manufacturer a way to recover development costs 
since the acquisition of sensar  the company has designed a replacement subsystem which reduced the cost of the electronics for this component by approximately 
because of the use of the remaining highly priced electronics subsystems in sensar s inventory in fiscal year june   the entire material and development costs were expensed during the period 
selling  general  and administrative selling  general  and administrative expenses remained relatively constant as a percentage of sales for the year ended june   compared to the year ended june  selling  general  and administrative expenses were  or of net sales  for the year ended june  this represents a small decline when compared to the year ended june   when selling  general  and administrative expenses were  or of net sales 
research and development the company is involved in a high tech industry which demands constant improvements and development of its instrumentation to remain technically viable 
since its inception  the company has dedicated significant operating funds to research and development 
for the five fiscal years june  to  research and development expenses averaged approximately of net sales and in the year ended june   were  or approximately of net sales 
for the fiscal year ended june   research and development expenses were  approximately of net sales 
this level of research and development reflects management s commitment to develop new products to enhance the revenue potential of the company 
liquidity and capital resources in recent years  the company has relied on the sale of common stock as the primary method to fund its working capital needs  operational losses  and research and development efforts 
during the year ended december   the six months ended december   and the year ended june   the company used   and  respectively  in operating activities 
the company anticipates it will continue to rely on equity funding in the near future to fund its operations 
the company received net proceeds from the issuance of common stock  principally from the exercise of warrants and options  in the net amount of  during the year ended december    during the six months ended december   and  during the fiscal year ended june  subsequent to december   the company has received approximately  from the exercise of warrants and gross proceeds of  from the private placement of preferred stock and warrants 
the warrants issued in the most recent private placement give the holders the right to purchase  shares of common stock at per share and the company currently has outstanding warrants to acquire  shares of common stock at prices ranging from to per share 
there is no obligation of the holders of these rights to exercise them and the exercise will largely depend on the price of the company s common stock in the public trading market  as to which no assurance can be given 
the company does not anticipate that the outstanding warrants will be exercised unless the trading price of the company s common stock exceeds the exercise price of the warrants at some time in the future 
at december   the company had total current assets of  and total current liabilities of  resulting in working capital of  and a working capital ratio of included in total current liabilities is the company s revolving line of credit with a balance of  limitations on the borrowing base for this line of credit have become so restrictive that it is not a significant source of reasonably priced working capital  and consequently the company has decided to terminate this line of credit as of march  the company will use a portion of its current cash holdings for this purpose 
the company has intangible assets totaling  principally related to product technology acquisition costs 
periodically  the company reviews the recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying value of individual identifiable intangible assets to the undiscounted estimated future net cash flows from current and anticipated products associated with each of these assets 
estimates of future cash flows are based on current demand for existing products  the progress toward commercialization of future products  and anticipated demand for existing and future products based on the company s market analyses and evaluations with current and potential strategic marketing partners 
management s estimates of future manufacturing costs and development and marketing expenses are based on historical levels and or industry norms 
in the course of the review of the company s assets and strategic direction undertaken by new management  approximately  in intangible assets were written down during the fourth quarter of see discussion above under recent developments and note b to the consolidated financial statements 
although management believes its current estimates of recoverability of intangible assets are reasonable  there is no assurance that actual future results will not differ from current expectations 
in the event of a change in expectations  the carrying value or amortization period of the long term asset would be adjusted which would affect the company s results of operations in the period in which such adjustment occurred 
the company s primary uses of cash for the year ended december   were the funds used in operations as discussed above and the purchase of property and equipment in the amount of  management expects that in the short term  the primary use of cash will continue to be operations due to the continued research and development activities  but also expects to use approximately  to terminate its line of credit 
in the opinion of management  current cash balances  including proceeds from the exercise of warrants and the private placement completed subsequent to year end  will provide the company with sufficient capital to fund its operations and development plans for the calendar year 
however  the company s ability to do so will depend on the successful introduction of new products so as to substantially increase the company s revenues during as conditions permit  the company intends to seek to establish a reasonably priced line of credit with a financial institution 
as new products are developed and commercialized and product demand is achieved  management believes that its long term operating and capital requirements will be funded principally through cash generated from operations  supplemented as necessary from equity or long term debt financing
