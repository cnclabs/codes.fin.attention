item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ significantly from those discussed in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under business and elsewhere herein 
overview cerus is developing systems designed to improve the safety of blood transfusions by inactivating infectious pathogens in blood components used for transfusion platelets  plasma and red blood cells and inhibiting the leukocyte white blood cell activity that is responsible for certain adverse immune and other transfusion related reactions 
the company s platelet and plasma pathogen inactivation systems are in phase clinical trials in the united states  and its red blood cell pathogen inactivation system is in preclinical development 
since its inception in  cerus has devoted substantially all of its efforts and resources to the research  development and clinical testing of techniques and systems for inactivating pathogens in blood transfusion components 
the company has been unprofitable since inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
all of the company s pathogen inactivation systems are in the research and development stage 
the company will be required to conduct significant research  development  testing and regulatory compliance activities on these products that  together with anticipated general and administrative expenses  are expected to result in substantial losses at least until commercialization of its products under development 
the company s ability to achieve a profitable level of operations in the future will depend on its ability to successfully complete development  obtain regulatory approvals and achieve market acceptance of its pathogen inactivation systems 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the company will ever achieve a profitable level of operations 
further  a significant portion of the company s development funding is provided by baxter healthcare corporation baxter under the agreements described below 
there can be no assurance that such agreements will not be modified or terminated as provided therein 
in december  cerus entered into a development and commercialization agreement with baxter to develop a system for inactivation of pathogens in platelets 
the agreement provides for baxter to make an equity investment and certain up front license and milestone payments 
the agreement further provides for baxter and the company to generally share system development costs equally  subject to mutually agreed budgets established from time to time 
the agreement also provides for a sharing of revenue from sales of inactivation system disposables  after each party is reimbursed for its cost of goods above a specified level 
in january  the company and baxter amended the agreement to provide that the company would receive an additional of the adjusted product revenue from the sale of the platelet pathogen inactivation system disposables in return for payment by the company to baxter of million in in four equal quarterly installments for development costs 
in january and july  cerus received approximately million from baxter in connection with interim funding agreements related to the development of pathogen inactivation systems for plasma for transfusions fresh frozen plasma or ffp and red blood cells 
in april  cerus entered into a second development and commercialization agreement with baxter  principally focused on the ffp and red blood cell pathogen inactivation systems 
the agreement provides for baxter to make certain equity investments  including two future milestone based investments of million each at of the market price at the time of the investment 
the agreement also provides for baxter and the company to generally share development costs of the systems equally  subject to mutually agreed budgets established from time to time 
the agreement further provides for the company and baxter to share gross profits from the sale of inactivation system disposables  after deducting from such gross profits a specified percentage allocation to be retained by the marketing party for marketing and administration expenses 
through december   baxter has paid the company up front license fees and milestone and development payments totaling million and has invested million in the capital stock of the company under the agreements described above 
in march  the company and baxter entered into an amendment to the april agreement providing that  to the extent the approved spending for for the red blood cell project exceeds million  cerus will fund all expenses for the red blood cell project in in excess of such amount  up to the amount of the approved budget 
to compensate cerus for such excess expenditures  baxter will fully fund the first expenditures under the approved budget for the red cell project for in an amount equal to such excess expenditures  after which the parties shall equally share the expenses of the red cell project 
if for any reason there is not an approved budget for the red cell project for  baxter will fully fund the first expenditures for under the approved budget for such other cerus baxter program or programs as cerus shall designate in an amount equal to the cerus excess expenditures 
if by july   however  there is not an approved budget for such other cerus baxter program or programs that is at least equal to such excess expenditures  baxter will promptly pay to cerus one half of the amount by which the excess expenditures exceed the amount of expenditures to be funded by baxter 
cerus anticipates that the expenditures for for the ffp program will exceed the previously approved budget 
cerus and baxter are discussing the level of funding each company will support in for the ffp program 
there can be no assurance that the parties will agree on a budget that would permit the ffp program to proceed in accordance with the company s plans 
to date  the company has not received any revenue from product sales and it will not derive revenue from product sales unless and until one or more planned products receives regulatory approval and achieves market acceptance 
the company anticipates that its sources of revenue until product sales occur will be limited to payments under development and commercialization agreements with baxter in the area of blood component pathogen inactivation  payments from the united states government under research grant programs  payments from future collaboration agreements  if any  and interest income 
under the agreements  all research  development  preclinical and clinical costs of the pathogen inactivation projects are shared by cerus and baxter 
because more of such research and development is typically performed internally at cerus than at baxter and because cerus is generally responsible for engaging third parties to perform certain aspects of these projects  the company s research and development expenses have exceeded its share of expenses 
as a result  the company has recognized revenue from baxter  giving rise to a receivable due from baxter and corresponding periodic balancing payments to the company 
at december   the amount of the baxter receivable was approximately million 
on february   baxter paid cerus approximately million in satisfaction of such receivable and anticipated adjustments 
through december   the company had recognized approximately million in revenue under its agreements with baxter  including the license fee and milestone amounts described above  and approximately million under united states government grants 
results of operations years ended december    and revenue 
revenue earned under the agreements for the years ending december   and was million  million and million and accounted for  and of the company s total revenue  respectively 
revenue from baxter increased in from  as the company recognized milestone and license fee revenue related to the platelet program of approximately million and recognized increased development revenue primarily relating to its ffp and red blood cell programs 
revenue from baxter decreased to approximately million in from  as no milestone or license fee revenue relating to the platelet program was recognized  as compared with approximately million in milestone and related license fee revenue recognized during in addition  ffp and red blood cell development revenue decreased in by approximately million  principally reflecting lower revenue during under the interim funding agreements 
government grant revenue  generally unchanged among the periods  was approximately   and  for the years  and  respectively 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for the years ending december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
the increases in and were due principally to third party costs  particularly toxicology studies  compound manufacturing development and initiation of clinical trials relating to the platelet and plasma programs  as well as to increased activity at the company in the ffp and red blood cell programs 
a significant portion of the increase was the result of increased payroll and other personnel expenses  related laboratory supplies  equipment and facilities expansion 
in addition  as described above  under an amendment to the platelet agreement  cerus made payments to baxter in of million for development costs in return for an additional share of platelet pathogen inactivation system adjusted product revenue 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were approximately million in  million in and million in the increases were primarily attributable to increased personnel levels associated with the expansion of the company s operations 
other income expense 
interest income was approximately million in   in and approximately  in the increase from to was attributable primarily to increased average cash balances related to proceeds from the company s initial public offering and private placement to baxter see liquidity and capital resources below 
the increase from to was attributable primarily to increased average cash balances related to financings and funding under the baxter platelet agreement 
interest expense was relatively unchanged and was approximately   and  for the years  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources from inception to december   cerus has financed its operations primarily through private placements of preferred and common equity securities  an initial public offering of common stock totaling approximately million and project funding provided by baxter totaling million 
during that period  the company received approximately million under united states government grants and approximately million in interest income 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and short term investments of approximately million 
net cash used in operating activities for   and was approximately million  million and million  respectively  resulting primarily from net losses 
from inception through december   net cash used in investing activities of approximately million resulted from short term cash investments  purchases of furniture and equipment  and leasehold improvements 
at december   the company s net operating loss carryforwards were approximately million and million for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively 
the company s federal research and development tax credit carryforwards were approximately million and  for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively  at december  the federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards expire at various dates from to the california state net operating loss expires in and the tax reform act of and state tax statutes contain provisions relating to changes in ownership that may limit the utilization in any given year of available net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credits 
see note of notes to financial statements 
the company s future capital requirements and the adequacy of its available funds will depend on many factors  including progress of the platelet and ffp programs and the related clinical trials  progress of the red blood cell program  achievement of milestones leading to equity investments  regulatory approval and successful commercialization of the company s pathogen inactivation systems  costs related to creating  maintaining and defending the company s intellectual property position  and competitive developments 
the company believes that its available cash balances  together with anticipated cash flows from existing baxter and grant arrangements  will be sufficient to meet its capital requirements for at least the next months 
in the event that additional capital is required  the company may seek to raise that capital through public or private equity or debt financings or through additional collaborative arrangements or government grants 
future capital funding transactions may result in dilution to stockholders 
there can be no assurance that such capital will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
impact of the year computer programs using two rather than four digits to identify the year in a date field may cause computer systems to malfunction in the year any computer programs that have time related software may determine a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to engage in specific business activities 
based on a recent assessment  the company has determined that it will be required to upgrade or replace a portion of its software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the company believes that  with upgrades of existing software and or conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its business activities 
the company has initiated communications with its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the company s operations are vulnerable to those third parties failure to solve their own year issues 
the company anticipates that its costs associated with the upgrade and or conversion of existing computer software relating to the year issue is less than  there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which the company relies will be converted on a timely basis and will not have an adverse effect on the company s operations 
estimated costs were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
however  there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties
