as is the case with most other companies using computers in their operations  the company is in the process of addressing matters relating to what is commonly referred as year compliance 
the company is currently undertaking a review of its systems and applications and those of its vendors to ensure that such systems and applications properly recognize the year the company will utilize internal and external resources to ensure that all of its systems and applications are year compliant and expects to complete and test such compliance within the next months 
there can be no guarantee that the systems and applications of the company will be year compliant and that any non compliance would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
seasonality and quarterly comparisons historically  the company s revenues have been seasonal  with the highest sales occurring during the months of june  july  and august  and the months of november  december  and january 
these periods correspond to the busy moviegoing seasons 
during these two periods  typically referred to as the summer and holiday seasons  respectively  moviegoing increases and motion picture studios typically release their big budget and most highly anticipated movies 
the advertising sales business is dependent on moviefone call volume and movielink session volume 
while calls and sessions tend to rise and fall with movie theater attendance  the company believes that they are less volatile than movie theater attendance 
teleticketing volume is generally more volatile than movie theater attendance 
when motion picture studios have released big budget  highly anticipated movies  teleticketing volume has increased significantly compared to other periods during the year 
the company believes this higher volume is the result of moviegoers increased concerns about particular performances being sold out 
in addition  motion picture distributors often release high profile movies for exhibition on a limited number of screens during the busy seasons 
the company believes that the limited release of high profile movies further heightens moviegoers concern that a particular movie will be sold out and increases teleticketing volume 
the company typically neither increases its staff during its busy periods nor decreases its staff during the other times of the year 
however  the company has scheduled periodic additions of telephone lines and related computer equipment to its moviefone systems just prior to these two busy seasons 
in addition to fluctuations in movie theater attendance  the company expects that its quarterly results will fluctuate due to its expansion efforts 
as the company expands its existing markets  enters into new markets and initiates new business activities  its expenses may increase more than its revenues  resulting in quarterly fluctuations in operating results 
impact of inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its operations to date 
however  substantial inflation driven increases in the costs of labor and telephone service in particular could adversely affect the company s profitability 
impact of new accounting standards during the year ended december   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no
