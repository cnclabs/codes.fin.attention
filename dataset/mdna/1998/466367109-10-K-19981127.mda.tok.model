excluding this unusual item  other revenues declined slightly to million in from million in and million in costs and expenses restaurant costs of sales  which include food and packaging costs  increased with sales growth and the addition of company operated restaurants to million in from million in and million in as a percent of restaurant sales  costs of sales were in  in and in the restaurant costs of sales percentage decreased in compared to primarily due to favorable ingredient costs  principally beef  pork and beverages  offset partially by increased produce and cheese costs 
the percentage increase in compared to was principally due to the cost of improved french fries  higher food costs of certain discount promotions and commodity cost increases  primarily pork and dairy 
restaurant operating costs were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
as a percent of restaurant sales  operating costs were in  in and in restaurant operating costs percentage increased in compared to primarily reflecting higher labor costs due to increases in minimum wage  initial training for operational improvements and industry wide labor shortages 
additionally  new restaurant preopening costs increased approximately 
of sales  principally due to an increase in new restaurants 
operating costs percentage declined in compared to primarily due to labor efficiencies and lower percentages of occupancy and other operating expenses 
while occupancy and other operating expenses increase with the addition of each new restaurant  such expenses for existing restaurants have increased at a slower rate than the increase in psa restaurant sales 
costs of distribution and other sales were million in  million in and million in  reflecting declines in distribution sales 
costs of distribution and other sales have declined as a percent of such sales to in from in and in in such costs included 
million in expenses related to the closure of a distribution center which had been used principally to distribute to chi chi s restaurants

see liquidity and capital resources 
the tax provisions reflect effective annual tax rates of  and of pre tax earnings in  and  respectively 
the low effective income tax rates in each year result from the company s ability to realize previously unrecognized tax benefits as the company s profitability has improved

cash was also used to reduce long term debt in the refinancing plan and to repurchase common stock as described below 
the company s working capital deficit increased million to million at september  from million at september   principally due to the decrease in cash and cash equivalents and increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the company and the restaurant industry in general  maintain relatively low levels of accounts receivable and inventories and vendors grant trade credit for purchases such as food and supplies 
the company also continually invests in its business through the addition of new units and refurbishment of existing units  which are reflected as long term assets and not as part of working capital

in addition  certain of the company s real estate and equipment secure other indebtedness 
the company requires capital principally to grow the business through new restaurant construction  as well as to maintain  improve and refurbish existing restaurants  and for general operating purposes 
the company s primary sources of liquidity are expected to be cash flows from operations  the revolving bank credit facility  and the sale and leaseback of restaurant properties 
an additional potential source of liquidity is the conversion of company operated restaurants to franchised restaurants 
based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth  the company expects that sufficient cash flows will be generated from operations so that  combined with other financing alternatives available  including utilization of cash on hand  bank credit facilities  the sale and leaseback of restaurants and financing opportunities  the company will be able to meet debt service  capital expenditure and working capital requirements 
although the amount of liability from claims and actions described in note of the consolidated financial statements cannot be determined with certainty  management believes the ultimate liability of such claims and actions should not materially affect the results of operations and liquidity of the company

year compliance historically  most computer databases  as well as embedded microprocessors in computer systems and industrial equipment  were designed with date data using only two digits of the year 
most computer programs  computers  and embedded microprocessors controlling equipment were programmed to assume that all two digit dates were preceded by  causing to be interpreted as the year this formerly common practice now could result in a computer system or embedded microprocessor which fails to recognize properly a year that begins with  rather than this in turn could result in computer system miscalculations or failures  as well as failures of equipment controlled by date sensitive microprocessors  and is generally referred to as the year issue 
the company s state of year readiness 
in the company began to formulate a plan to address its year issues 
the company s year plan now involves five phases awareness  assessment  remediation  testing and implementation 
awareness involves helping employees who deal with the company s computer assets  and managers  executives and directors to understand the nature of the year problem 
assessment involves the identification and inventory of the company s information technology it systems and embedded microprocessor technology et and the determination as to whether such technology will properly recognize a year that begins with  rather than it et systems that  among other things  properly recognize a year beginning with are said to be year ready 
remediation involves the repair or replacement of it et systems that are not year ready 
testing involves the testing of repaired or replaced it et systems 
implementation is the installation and integration of remediated and tested it et systems 
the phases overlap substantially 
the company has made substantial progress in the awareness  assessment  remediation and testing phases and has completed implementation of a number of systems 
awareness and assessment 
the company has established an ad hoc committee of the board of directors and multiple management teams which are responsible for the company s activities in addressing the year issue 
the company has also sent letters to more than  of its vendors of goods and services to bring the year issue to their attention and to assess their readiness 
the company has advised its franchisees who operate approximately of system restaurants that they are required to be year ready by december  and has provided video information and regional presentations regarding year issues 
the company has invited franchisees to participate on a year team 
while the awareness and assessment phases will continue into the year  they are substantially complete at this time 
remediation  testing and implementation 
although remediation  testing and implementation will be substantially completed during  some systems identified as noncritical may not be addressed until after january the following table describes by category and status  major identified it applications 
remediation status category ready in process remaining mainframe third party developed software 



internally developed software 



hardware 














desktop third party developed software 



internally developed software 



corporate hardware 









restaurant hardware 








distribution systems third party developed software 



internally developed software

critical systems will be repaired or replaced during the company expects to have completed remediation  testing and implementation for both internal and third party mainframe hardware and software by fall a substantial portion of the computer hardware in the corporate offices is being replaced and the remainder is being otherwise remediated 
the company will replace personal computers and install remediated software in company restaurants on an established schedule during  nearly all are expected to be completed by august 
it systems in the company s six distribution centers will be replaced on an established schedule during embedded technology 
the company has identified categories of critical restaurant equipment in which et may be found  has sent letters to the majority of the vendors of such equipment and is in the process of identifying the remaining vendors 
although many have not responded  the responses the company has received to date have identified only one type of equipment with date sensitive et that the company believes should be replaced 
replacement components are currently being tested and are expected to be implemented in company restaurants during the company continues to evaluate information in letter responses and other materials received from vendors  on web sites  and from other sources  in identifying date sensitive et 
vendors of important goods and services 
the company has identified and sent letters to approximately  key vendors in an attempt to gain assurance of vendors year readiness 
as of november   the company has received responses concerning year readiness from about one third of those vendors 
the company is in the process of identifying which of those vendors it considers to be critical to its business 
the company expects to continue discussions with the critical vendors of goods and services throughout to attempt to ensure the uninterrupted supply of goods and services and to develop contingency plans in the event of the failure of any of such vendors to become and remain year ready 
the company s franchisees 
at september   restaurants were operated by franchisees in the united states 
seven restaurants were operated by franchisees outside the united states 
the company has completed an assessment of the year readiness of the personal computers it has leased to approximately of franchised restaurants in the united states  together with software it has licensed them to use 
such computers and software were determined not to be year ready and will be replaced with compliant computers and remediated software at franchisees expense during the company has advised its franchisees  both domestic and international  that they are required to be year ready by december  the costs to address the company s year issues 
the company estimates that it has incurred costs of approximately million to date for the awareness  assessment  remediation  testing and implementation phases of its year plan 
approximately million was spent during fiscal these amounts have come principally from the general operating and capital budgets of the company s management information systems department 
the company currently estimates the total costs of completing its year plan  including costs incurred to date  to be approximately million  approximately relating to new systems which have been or will be capitalized 
some planned system replacements  which will provide significant future benefits  were accelerated due to the year and have resulted in increased it spending 
this estimate is based on currently available information and will be updated as the company continues its assessment of third party relationships  proceeds with its testing and implementation  and designs contingency plans 
the risks of the company s year issues 
if any it or et systems critical to the company s operations have been overlooked in the assessment  remediation  testing or implementation phases  if any of the company s remediated internal computer systems are not successfully remediated  or if a significant number of the company s franchisees do not become year ready in a timely manner  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition of a magnitude which the company has not yet fully analyzed 
in addition  the company has not yet been assured that the computer systems of all of its key vendors will be year ready in a timely manner or that the computer systems of third parties with which the company s computer systems exchange data will be year ready both in a timely manner and in a manner compatible with continued data exchange with the company s computer systems 
if the vendors of the company s most important goods and services  or the suppliers of the company s necessary energy  telecommunications and transportation needs  fail to provide the company with the materials and services which are necessary to produce  distribute and sell its products  the electrical power and other utilities necessary to sustain its operations  or reliable means of transporting supplies to its restaurants and franchisees  such failure could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations  liquidity and financial condition of the company 
the company s contingency plan 
the company is in the initial stages of developing a business contingency plan to address both unavoided and unavoidable year risks 
although the company expects to have the plan well developed by late summer  enhancements and revisions will be continuously considered and implemented  as appropriate  throughout the remainder of the year and into the year new accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas  reporting comprehensive income

this statement is effective for all fiscal years beginning after june  sfas is effective for the company s fiscal year ending october  and is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary exposure relating to financial instruments is to changes in interest rates 
the company uses interest rate swap agreements to reduce exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
at september   the company had a million notional amount interest rate swap agreement expiring in june this agreement effectively converts a portion of the company s variable rate bank debt to fixed rate debt and has a pay rate of 
at september   a hypothetical one percentage point increase in short term interest rates would result in a reduction of 
million in annual pre tax earnings 
the estimated reduction is based on holding the unhedged portion of bank debt at its september  level 
at september   the company had no other material financial instruments subject to significant market exposure
