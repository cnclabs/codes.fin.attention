the  increase in net income available to common shareholders from and was primarily due to increased rental rates for fully stabilized communities and an increase in units placed in service 
community operations the company s net income is generated primarily from the operation of its apartment communities 
for purposes of evaluating comparative operating performance  the company categorizes its operating communities based on the period each community reaches stabilized occupancy 
a community is generally considered by the company to have achieved stabilized occupancy on the earlier to occur of i attainment of physical occupancy on the first day of any month or ii one year after completion of construction 
at december   the company s portfolio of apartment communities consisted of the following i communities that were completed and stabilized for all of the current and prior year  ii eight communities that achieved full stabilization during the prior year  iii four communities which reached stabilization during  iv communities that were acquired by way of the merger during and v communities and an additional phase of three existing communities in the development or lease up stage 
for communities with respect to which construction is completed and the community has become fully operational  all property operating and maintenance expenses are expensed as incurred and those recurring and non recurring expenditures relating to acquiring new assets  materially enhancing the value of an existing asset  or substantially extending the useful life of an existing asset are capitalized 
see capitalization of fixed assets and community improvements 
the company has adopted an accounting policy related to communities in the development and lease up stage whereby substantially all operating expenses including pre opening marketing expenses are expensed as incurred 
the company treats each unit in an apartment community separately for cost accumulation  capitalization and expense recognition purposes 
prior to the commencement of leasing activities  interest and other construction costs are capitalized and reflected on the balance sheet as construction in progress 
once a unit is placed in service  all operating expenses allocated to that unit  including interest  are expensed as incurred 
during the lease up phase  the sum of interest expense on completed units and other operating expenses including pre opening marketing expenses will initially exceed rental revenues  resulting in a lease up deficit  which continues until such time as rental revenues exceed such expenses 
therefore  in order to evaluate the operating performance of its communities  the company has presented financial information which summarizes the revenue in excess of specified expense on a comparative basis for all of its operating communities combined and for communities which have reached stabilization prior to january  the company has also presented financial information reflecting the dilutive impact of lease up deficits incurred for communities in the development and lease up stage and not yet operating at break even

funds from operations and cash available for distribution historical funds from operations the company considers funds from operations ffo an appropriate measure of performance of an equity reit 
ffo is defined to mean net income loss determined in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation of real estate assets  and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the company s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the company s needs 
cash available for distribution cad is defined as ffo less capital expenditures funded by operations and loan amortization payments 
the company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the company  ffo and cad should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated financial statements and data included elsewhere in this report 
ffo and cad for the years ended december   and presented on a historical basis are summarized in the following table calculations of funds from operations and cash available for distribution year ended december  net income available to common shareholders
