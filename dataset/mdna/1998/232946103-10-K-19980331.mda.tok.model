item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company designs  develops  manufactures and markets a sample preparation system for medical diagnostic applications 
the thinprep system consists of the thin prep processor  and related disposable reagents  filters and other supplies 
the company has marketed the thinprep system for use in non gynecological testing applications since on may   the company received pma approval from the fda to market the thinprep system for cervical cancer screening as a replacement for the conventional pap smear method 
on november   the fda cleared expanded product labeling for the thinprep system to include the claim that the thinprep system is significantly more effective in detecting lgsil and more severe lesions than the conventional pap smear method in a variety of patient populations 
the expanded labeling also indicates that the specimen quality using the thinprep system is significantly improved over that of the conventional pap smear method 
on february   the fda approved the company s supplemental pma application for use of a combination of an endocervical brush and spatula sampling devices  which is a commonly used method of collecting samples for conventional pap smears 
on september   the fda approved the company s supplemental pma application for the testing for hpv directly from a single vial of patient specimen collected in a thinprep solution using the hybrid capture hpv dna assay of digene corporation 
the company conducted the full scale commercial launch of the thinprep system for cervical cancer screening in the united states in since inception  the company has incurred substantial losses  principally from expenses associated with obtaining fda approval of the company s thinprep system for cervical cancer screening  engineering and development efforts related to the thinprep system  expansion of the company s manufacturing facilities  and the establishment of a marketing and sales organization 
the company expects such losses to continue for the foreseeable future as it expands its domestic and establishes its international marketing and sales activities  continues its product development efforts  and commences full scale manufacturing of the thinprep system for cervical cancer screening 
the operating results of the company have fluctuated significantly in the past on an annual and a quarterly basis 
the company expects that its operating results will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the future and will depend on a number of factors  including the extent to which the company s products gain market acceptance  the rate and size of expenditures incurred as the company expands its domestic and establishes its international sales and distribution networks  the timing of any approvals of the thinprep system for reimbursement by third party payors  and other factors  many of which are outside the company s control 
the company occupies a  square foot facility in boxborough  massachusetts 
the company has installed new custom built automated equipment for the high volume manufacture of disposable filters for use in connection with the thinprep system 
the company believes that in the united states  the current rate of reimbursement of laboratories from managed care organizations and other third party payors to screen conventional pap smears ranges from approximately to per test  with as the most common rate of reimbursement 
the company believes that the cost per thinprep pap test  plus a laboratory mark up  will be billed to third party payors and result in a higher cost than the current charge for conventional pap tests 
in the past  the company has offered discounts to stimulate demand for the thinprep system and may elect to do so in the future  which discounts could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes that its expanded fda labeling supported by clinical field and trial results may assist in the establishment of increased reimbursement for the thinprep pap test 
although united healthcare has announced that it will expand its healthcare coverage to include the thinprep pap test  the applicable rate of reimbursement is negotiated between united healthcare or its various plans and the specific clinical laboratories servicing such plans 
in february  blue cross blue shield of massachusetts announced that it would expand its healthcare coverage to include the thinprep pap test and since that announcement  fifteen additional blue cross and blue shield plans across the united states have added the thinprep pap test to their list of covered benefits 
in  the united states health care financing administration ushcfa determined that medicare would cover the thinprep pap test 
because the thinprep pap test is a new test  the ushcfa did not assign a reimbursement level for the procedure  but instead allows medicare intermediaries at the state level to gap fill or reimburse for the procedure based on the laboratory billing they receive 
although a number of managed care organizations have added the thinprep pap test to their coverage  there can be no assurance that third party payors will provide or continue to provide such coverage  that reimbursement levels will be adequate or that healthcare providers or clinical laboratories will use the thinprep system for cervical cancer screening in lieu of the conventional pap smear method 
the company will continue to increase the amount of expenditures for marketing  sales and customer support activities of the thinprep system for cervical cancer screening 
there can be no assurance  however  that such investments will result in increased net sales or that the company s direct sales force will succeed in promoting the thinprep system to healthcare providers  third party payors or clinical laboratories  or that additional marketing and sales channels will be successfully established 
during  the company entered into a number of agreements in connection with its marketing and sales activities  including a co promotion agreement with mead johnson company  a division of bristol myers squibb  to promote the thinprep pap test to obstetricians in the united states  and an agreement with quest diagnostics incorporated to provide thinprep pap testing at its clinical laboratories in the united states 
the quest diagnostics agreement is exclusive in that quest will only provide other liquid based mono or thin layer sample preparation technologies if fda labeling claims for such products exceed the fda labeling claims of the thinprep system and will only provide computer aided rescreening upon customer initiated request 
quest diagnostics and the company agreed to coordinate their efforts in planning and marketing the thinprep pap test to medical professionals and third party payors 
there can be no assurance that such marketing  sales and customer support activities will result in increased net sales  that the agreements with mead johnson company  quest diagnostics incorporated or other third parties will be successful  that the company s direct sales force will succeed in promoting the thinprep system to health care providers  third party payors or clinical laboratories  or that additional marketing and sales channels will be successfully established 
the company will continue to increase its expenditures for research and development to fund development of follow on products and additional applications of thinprep technology 
the company will also continue to increase the amount of expenditures for administrative activities  principally for the employment of additional administrative personnel  increases in professional fees and the incremental costs associated with being a publicly held company 
the company is the exclusive licensee of certain patented technology used in the thinprep system 
in consideration for this license  the company has agreed to pay a royalty equal to of net sales of the thinprep processor  filter cylinder disposable products that are used with the thinprep system  and improvements made by the company relating to such items 
royalty payments  in connection with this license for the years ended  and were   and  respectively 
results of operations years ended december  and december  net sales increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
this increase in sales was primarily due to an increase in the number of thinprep processors sold  sales of the company s thinprep pap test for cervical cancer screening  and additional sales of related reagents  filters and other supplies for non gynecological testing 
gross profit increased to million in from million in  an increase of  and the gross margin increased to in from in management attributes the increase in gross margin in primarily to the introduction and sales of the thinprep pap test beginning in the later part of  the subsequent change in product mix  and increased sale prices for non gynecological tests and thinprep processors 
total operating expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
research and development costs increased to million in from million in  an increase of  as a result of employment of additional research and development personnel and engineering consulting expenses 
sales  marketing and customer support increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase in sales  marketing and customer support costs reflects the employment of additional sales and customer support personnel  increased commission expenses  expenses associated with the mead johnson co promotion agreement  and additional marketing consulting costs related to the commercial launch of the thinprep pap test 
general and administrative costs increased to million in from million in  an increase of  due to the employment of additional administrative personnel  increased business insurance costs  and legal expenses 
net interest income increased to million in from million in  an increase of  due to an increase in the average cash balance available for investment 
years ended december  and december  net sales increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
this increase in sales was primarily due to an increase in the number of thinprep processors sold  initial sales of the company s new thinprep pap test for cervical cancer screening  and additional sales of related reagents  filters and other supplies for non gynecological testing 
gross profit increased to million in from million in  an increase of  and the gross margin increased to in from in management attributes the increase in gross margin in to the introduction of the thinprep pap test during the later part of and increased sale prices for non gynecological tests and thinprep processors  offset partially by the lower unit margin for unit sales to existing customers upgrading to the thinprep processor 
total operating expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
research and development costs increased to million in from million in  an increase of  as a result of employment of additional research and development personnel and engineering consulting expenses 
sales  marketing and customer support increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase in sales  marketing and customer support costs reflects the employment of additional sales and customer support personnel  increased commission expenses  increased customer training costs and additional marketing consulting costs related to the commercial launch of the thinprep pap test 
general and administrative costs increased to million in from million in  an increase of due to the employment of additional administrative personnel  increased business insurance costs and expenses associated with being a publicly held company 
net interest income increased to million in from  in  an increase of  due to an increase in the average cash balance available for investment 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  the company s expenses have significantly exceeded its revenue  resulting in an accumulated deficit of million as of december  the company has funded its operations primarily through the private placement and public sale of equity securities aggregating million  net of offering expenses 
at december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased during primarily due to the issuance of  shares of common stock in connection with the company s second public offering for aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
cash used in the company s operations was million  million and million for  and respectively 
the increase in cash used in operations in was primarily due to a significant loss from operations of million  which included the expansion of the company s marketing  sales and customer support organizations  offset by an increase in current liabilities 
the company s capital expenditures for the years ended  and were  million  and million respectively 
the decrease in capital expenditures in was due primarily to reduced purchases for customized manufacturing equipment and leasehold improvements for the company s new facility 
additionally  as of december   the company had commitments for customized manufacturing equipment of approximately million 
accounts receivable increased million to approximately million during as a result of increased sales volume 
inventories increased approximately million to million from december  to december  due primarily to the company s planned sales increase of thinprep pap tests  thinprep processors and reagents  filters and other supplies for non gynecological testing in stockholders equity increased approximately million from december  to december  primarily due to the sale of  shares of common stock in connection with the company s second public offering in february  which was offset by the net loss of million 
the company s future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the resources required to further develop its marketing and sales capabilities  both domestic and international  and the extent to which such activities generate market acceptance and demand for the thinprep system for cervical cancer screening 
the company s capital requirements will also depend upon the progress of the company s research and development programs including clinical trials  the receipt of and the time required to obtain regulatory clearances and approvals  and the resources the company devotes to developing  manufacturing and marketing its products 
in addition  the company s capital requirements will depend on the extent of potential liabilities  if any  and costs associated with  existing or future litigation 
see legal proceedings 
there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional financing or will not in the future seek to raise additional funds through bank facilities  debt or equity offerings or other sources of capital 
additional funding may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to the company  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
certain factors which may affect future results the company does not provide financial performance forecasts 
the forward looking statements in this form k are made under the safe harbor provisions of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the company s operating results and financial condition have varied and may in the future vary significantly depending on a number of factors 
statements in this form k which are not strictly historical statements  including  without limitation  statements regarding management s plans and objectives for future operations  domestic and international marketing and sales plans  product plans and performance  potential savings to the healthcare system  management s assessment of market factors  as well as statements regarding the strategy and plans of the company  constitute forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the following factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
such factors  among others  may have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations and financial conditions 
the following discussion of the company s risk factors should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included herein 
because of these and other factors  past financial performance should not be considered an indication of future performance 
dependence on single product 
substantially all of the company s revenues to date have been derived from sales of its thinprep processor and predecessor instruments  and related reagents  filters and other supplies  for use in gynecological and non gynecological testing applications 
the company s inability to successfully commercialize the thinprep system for cervical cancer screening or to obtain adequate third party reimbursement coverage  among other factors  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
uncertainty of market acceptance and additional cost 
the company s success and growth will depend on market acceptance of the thinprep system for cervical cancer screening by healthcare providers  third party payors and clinical laboratories 
the laboratory cost of using the thinprep system for cervical cancer screening is higher than that of a conventional pap smear 
due in part to increased competitive pressures in the healthcare industry to reduce costs  the company s ability to gain market acceptance of the thinprep system for cervical cancer screening will depend on the company s ability to demonstrate that the higher cost of using the thinprep system will be offset by a reduction in costs often associated with conventional pap smears  including inaccurate diagnoses and the need for repeat pap tests 
limited marketing and sales experience 
although the company received clearance from the fda to market its thinprep system for cervical cancer screening on may   the company initiated full scale marketing and sales efforts for the thinprep system in united states beginning only in the first quarter of the company depends on strategic marketing relationships with mead johnson and large clinical laboratories to effect commercial scale marketing in the united states 
there can be no assurance that such relationships will succeed in promoting the thinprep system in the united states 
the company has limited experience in selling the thinprep system for cervical cancer screening  and no assurance can be given that its direct marketing and sales organization will succeed in promoting the thinprep system in the united states or internationally 
dependence on third party reimbursement 
successful sales of the thinprep system for cervical cancer screening in the united states and other countries will depend on the availability of adequate reimbursement from third party payors such as private insurance plans  managed care organizations  and medicare and medicaid 
although united healthcare has announced that it will expand its healthcare coverage to include the thinprep pap test  the applicable rate of reimbursement is negotiated between united healthcare or its various plans and the specific clinical laboratories servicing such plans 
in february  blue cross blue shield of massachusetts announced that it would expand its healthcare coverage to include the thinprep pap test and since that announcement  fifteen additional blue cross and blue shield plans across the united states have added the thinprep pap test to their list of covered benefits 
although a number of managed care organizations have added the thinprep pap test to their coverage  there can be no assurance that reimbursement will be available  reimbursement levels will be adequate or that healthcare providers or clinical laboratories will use the thinprep system for cervical cancer screening in lieu of the conventional pap smear method 
in february  the bluecross blueshield association s technology evaluation center announced results of a recent review of three new cervical cancer screening technologies  including the thinprep pap test  with respect to cost effectiveness 
although the review concluded that such technologies offered only modest improvement  the company believes that the study did not consider certain cost advantages inherent in using the thinprep system 
the study s conclusions are not binding and do not represent a national coverage or reimbursement decision by the blue cross and blue shield organizations 
although the company believes that to date the review has not caused any change in the decision of blue cross and blue shield plans currently reimbursing laboratories for the thinprep pap test  there can be no assurance that the review will not lead to adverse reimbursement decisions by blue cross  blue shield plans or others 
there is significant uncertainty concerning third party reimbursement for the use of any medical device incorporating new technology 
limited number of customers and lengthy sales process 
due in part to a recent trend toward consolidation of clinical laboratories  the company expects that the number of potential domestic customers for its products will decrease 
due to the relative size of the largest united states laboratories  it is likely that a significant portion of thinprep system sales will be concentrated among a relatively small number of large clinical laboratories 
further  in order to generate demand for the thinprep pap test among clinical laboratories  the company will be required to educate physicians and healthcare providers regarding the clinical benefits and cost effectiveness of the thinprep system as well as to demonstrate to such parties that adequate levels of reimbursement will be available for the thinprep pap test  a process which the company believes will require a lengthy sales effort 
limited operating history  uncertainty of profitability 
the company has a limited operating history and  to date  has focused on product development  clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approvals  the expansion of manufacturing facilities and the establishment of marketing and sales capabilities for its thinprep system for cervical cancer screening in the united states and abroad 
the company has limited experience in marketing and selling the thinprep system for cervical cancer screening 
the company s future revenues and profitability are critically dependent on the company s ability to successfully market and sell the thinprep system for cervical cancer screening 
risks associated with commercialization 
in connection with the full scale commercialization of the thinprep system for cervical cancer screening  the company has significantly expanded its facilities and intends to continue to significantly increase the number of its marketing and sales  engineering  and financial personnel  and enhance or replace its management information systems 
such activities are likely to place significant strain on the company s management  operations and systems 
intense competition 
the company faces direct competition from a number of publicly traded and privately held companies  including at least one other manufacturer of a thin layer slide preparation system which is seeking approval of its pma application 
in addition  neopath  inc is seeking fda approval of its autopap qc product  an automated computer aided imaging system  as a primary screening method 
on january   the fda s hematology and pathology devices panel unanimously recommended that the fda approve the autopap qc for primary screening 
the fda typically accords substantial weight to a panel s recommendation but is not bound by it 
the development  fda approval and commercial marketing of such systems for cervical cancer screening could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
many of the company s existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  sales  distribution and technical resources than the company  and more experience in research and development  clinical trials  regulatory matters  manufacturing and marketing 
history of losses 
the company has incurred substantial losses since inception 
the company expects such losses to continue for the foreseeable future due to expansion of its sales and marketing activities  both domestic and international  its product development efforts  and commencement of full scale commercial manufacturing 
potential fluctuations in future quarterly results 
the company expects that its operating results will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the future and will depend on a number of factors  many of which are outside the company s control 
these factors include the extent to which the company s products gain market acceptance  the rate and size of expenditures incurred as the company expands its domestic and establishes its international sales and distribution networks  the timing of any approvals of the thinprep system for reimbursement by third party payors  the timing and size of sales  the likelihood and timing of fda approval of pma supplements related to the thinprep system  the timing and size of expenditures incurred in the research and development of new products  and the introduction and market acceptance of competing products or technologies 
extensive government regulation 
the manufacture and sale of medical diagnostic devices are subject to extensive government regulation in the united states and in other countries 
the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals can be time consuming  expensive and uncertain  frequently requiring several years from the commencement of clinical trials to the receipt of regulatory approval 
after approval  the company and its medical products remain subject to pervasive regulation and fda inspection for compliance with regulatory requirements 
in july  several petitions were filed requesting that the fda review the pma approval granted to the thinprep system 
the petitions were filed pursuant to a provision of the fdc act permitting any interested party to initiate a process by which the fda may review an approval order and may issue an order affirming  reversing or modifying the approval 
to the company s knowledge  the fda has conducted a review pursuant to this provision only twice since the enactment of the medical device amendments of the company responded to the petitions by submitting comments in december arguing that the fda should deny them 
no assurance can be given that the fda will not conduct a review of the pma approval granted to the thinprep system  nor can assurance be given that the fda will not  after such review  issue an order reversing or unfavorably modifying the original pma approval 
any such action by the fda would have a material adverse effect on the company 
international sales and operations risks 
the company has commenced sale of its thinprep system and intends to sell any future products to customers both in the united states and internationally 
while the company is evaluating marketing and sales channels abroad  including contract sales organizations  distributors and marketing partners  the company currently has very limited foreign sales channels in place at this time 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully develop international sales capabilities or that  if the company establishes such capabilities  the company will be successful in obtaining reimbursement or any regulatory approvals required in foreign countries 
uncertainty of additional applications 
the company intends to continue to evaluate additional diagnostic applications of its thinprep technology in testing for the presence of other types of cancers and sexually transmitted diseases 
the company has not yet determined which of these applications  if any  it will seek to develop and commercialize 
dependence on key personnel 
the company is highly dependent on the principal members of its management and scientific staff  the loss of whose services might impede achievement of its research and development or strategic objectives 
the company s success will depend on its ability to retain key employees and to attract additional qualified employees 
dependence on patents  copyrights  licenses and proprietary rights  risk of third party claims of infringement 
the company relies on a combination of patents  trade secrets  copyrights and confidentiality agreements to protect its proprietary technology  rights and know how 
in addition  the company is the exclusive licensee of certain patented technology for use in the field of cytology related to the fluid pumping system used in the thinprep system 
failure by the company to protect  defend and maintain such intellectual property rights  or a third party claim of infringement  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on single source suppliers 
certain key components of the thinprep system  including its proprietary filter  are currently provided to the company by single sources 
in the event that the company is unable to obtain sufficient quantities of such components on commercially reasonable terms  or in a timely manner  the company would not be able to manufacture its products on a timely and cost competitive basis  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
year compliance 
the company has taken actions to understand the nature and extent of work required to make its products  systems and infrastructure year compliant 
the company uses a number of computer software programs and operating systems in its internal operations  including applications used in manufacturing  product development  financial business systems and various administrative functions 
to the extent that these software applications contain source code that is unable to appropriately interpret the upcoming year  some level of modification or possibly replacement of such source code or applications will be necessary 
while these efforts will involve some additional costs  the company believes  based on available information  that it will be able to manage its total year transition without any material adverse effect on its business  financial condition or operating results 
impact of ongoing litigation 
the company is currently involved in ongoing commercial litigation 
any such litigation  regardless of the outcome  could result in substantial cost to the company and divert management s attention from the company s operations
