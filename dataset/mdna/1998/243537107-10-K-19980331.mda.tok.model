item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following table is derived from the company s statement of earnings and sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain income statement data as a percentage of net sales 
years ended december net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses loss on factory closure earnings from operations other expense earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales increased by  or between the years ended december  and sales of the teva r line increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december   a increase 
sales of teva r products represented and of net sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in teva r sales was primarily due to increased demand for this line 
in addition  in early  sales of the teva r line were adversely impacted by the excess inventory at retail  which the retailers had carried into from the season 
this situation did not recur in also  in the fourth quarter of  the company implemented a spring early delivery program that provided retailers an incentive to bring teva r products in for the fourth quarter and expand the length of the selling season 
due to the success of this program approximately to million of teva r product was shipped in the fourth quarter of  which the company believes ordinarily would have shipped in the first quarter of net sales of footwear under the simple r product line decreased from  to  between the years ended december  and this decrease was primarily due to the continued repositioning of the simple r brand and its distribution  and the non recurrence of last year s demand for certain styles of simple r clogs 
net sales of footwear under the ugg r product line decreased from  to  between the years ended december  and this decrease was due to reduced demand for the company s product offering  resulting from pricing pressures  reduced advertising spending and a carry over of product at retail from overall  international sales for all of the company s products increased from  to  representing of net sales in and in because the increase in the volume of sales of teva r footwear products more than offset the decrease in the volume of sales of simple r and ugg r footwear products  the volume of footwear sold increased from  pairs during the year ended december  to  pairs during the year ended december  the weighted average wholesale price per pair sold during the years ended december  and decreased from to 
the decrease was primarily due to a change in the sales mix resulting from the reduction in sales of ugg r products in  which have a significantly higher weighted average selling price than the company s other product lines 
in addition  the company experienced a change in the sales mix for simple r products  with significantly greater sales of the relatively higher priced clogs and fewer close outs during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this decrease was partially offset by the lower volume of teva r close outs during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  cost of sales increased by  or to  for the year ended december   compared with  for the year ended december  gross profit increased by  or to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  and increased as a percentage of net sales to from 
the increase in gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to significantly reduced levels of teva r and ugg r close outs during the year ended december  compared to the corresponding levels for the year ended december  this increase was partially offset by higher levels of simple r close outs during this period 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  or between the years ended december  and december  and increased as a percentage of net sales from in to in the increase was largely a result of increased royalties payable to the licensor of the teva r patents and trademarks due to a change in the sales mix toward teva r products 
in addition the company experienced increased legal costs related to disputes with some of the former shareholders of ugg holdings  inc  increased european operating expenses due to the opening and operation of the european office in  increased amortization of intangible assets  increased costs associated with the teva r apparel line and an increase in research and development spending 
the increase in amortization of intangible assets was primarily due to the amortization of teva r license fees for the five year period beginning september  as well as increased goodwill amortization associated with the ugg r acquisition payments 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense and ugg advertising costs between the years ended december  and december  in  the company also incurred a loss on factory closure aggregating  related to the march closure of its california manufacturing facility 
upon closure  the company moved the related production requirements to its manufacturing facility in mexico and to other independent subcontractors in the far east  costa rica and the united states 
the  loss included property and equipment write downs  employee severance and other exit costs 
no similar closure occurred in other expense decreased from  in to  in the decrease resulted from a  decrease in net interest expense  primarily due to repayments on the company s borrowings under its credit facility in in addition  in the company incurred a loss on disposal of assets aggregating  compared with a net gain on disposal of assets of  in income taxes were  for the year ended december   representing an effective income tax rate of compared with income taxes of  for the year ended december   representing an effective income tax rate of 
the lower effective income tax rate in compared to is due to certain non deductible expenses and losses being a lower proportion to earnings before income taxes in than in such non deductible items include the amortization of goodwill and losses at certain subsidiaries which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes but which are not consolidated for income tax reporting purposes 
the company had net earnings of  for the year ended december  as compared with net earnings of  for the year ended december   an increase of  for the reasons discussed above 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales decreased by  or between the years ended december  and due to several offsetting factors 
in early  the company experienced strong sales of the teva r line 
however  beginning in the second quarter of  the company was impacted by the poor overall retail markets and the abundance of sports sandals in the marketplace 
as a result  the company began heavy discounting in efforts to move the resulting oversupply of teva r product and was able to sell a significant portion of this excess inventory in the latter half of and the first half of this excess inventory was carried by retailers in  thus negatively impacting the company s teva r sales 
as a result  net sales of the teva r line decreased from  to  a decrease between the years ended december  and  respectively 
sales of teva r products represented and of net sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company also experienced a decrease in sales for the year ended december   of its ugg r product line as the company repositioned this brand toward higher end retailers  avoiding some of the lower end retailers which were sold to previously 
consistent with the teva r and simple r lines  the company is trying to sell ugg r primarily in the higher end retail markets in an effort to promote the brand where it can command higher prices and margins 
in addition  due to the unseasonably late winter in  many retailers had a remaining stock of ugg r products which they carried over into the fall and winter of  thereby negatively impacting sales 
these factors  combined with the increased competition for the brand caused net sales for ugg r to decrease from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december   a decrease 
the decline in ugg r sales was exacerbated by substantially higher costs for sheepskin and consequently higher prices charged by the company on ugg r products 
offsetting these factors  net sales of footwear under the simple r product line increased from  to  between the year ended december  and simple r sales represented and of net sales for the year ended december  and  respectively 
overall  international sales for the company s products increased from  to  representing of net sales in and in the combination of these factors led to a net decrease in the volume of footwear sold  which decreased from  pairs for the year ended december  to  pairs for the year ended december   a decrease 
the weighted average wholesale price per pair sold during these periods decreased from to  or by for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in late  the company made a decision not to carry over into certain styles of its ugg r boots and as a result  it sold its remaining supply of such styles at reduced prices in december in addition  the company reduced the prices of certain teva r styles in the spring line  in order to promote a more even distribution of price points between the high and low points 
the company believes that having such an even price point distribution will place one or more styles at each desired price level 
also  the company experienced a reduction in ugg r sales  which have a higher weighted average selling price than the company s other lines 
cost of sales decreased by  to  for the year ended december   compared with  for the year ended december   a decrease of 
gross profit increased by  or to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   an increase as a percentage of net sales to from 
the increase in gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the non recurrence of the significant inventory write downs as well as the heavily discounted selling prices which were experienced in selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  or between the years ended december  and december   and increased as a percentage of net sales from in to in the increase was primarily due to the addition of the operations of ugg holdings  inc ugg holdings in august as a result  the company s financial statements include twelve months of operating expenses for ugg holdings in compared to only five months in the added months in were during the company s seasonally slow period for revenues  resulting in an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales 
the increase in operating expenses and the increase as a percentage of sales was also due to increased warehouse costs  which were partially a result of the company s move to a new warehouse facility in  as well as increased advertising costs and increased payroll costs for newly created positions 
income taxes were  for the year ended december   representing an effective income tax rate of compared with income taxes of  for the year ended december   representing an effective income tax rate of 
the higher effective income tax rate in compared to is due to certain non deductible expenses and losses being a greater proportion to earnings before income taxes in than in such non deductible items include the amortization of the goodwill associated with the acquisition of ugg holdings  inc  and in the company experienced greater non deductible losses at certain subsidiaries which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes but which are not consolidated for income tax reporting purposes 
the company had net earnings of  for the year ended december   as compared with net earnings of  for the year ended december   an increase of for the reasons discussed above 
outlook this outlook section contains a number of forward looking statements  all of which are based on current expectations 
actual results may differ materially 
due to the success of teva s r fourth quarter early delivery program in  approximately to million of teva product was shipped in the fourth quarter of  which the company believes ordinarily would have shipped in the first quarter of the company expects that while sales for teva r will increase on a season to season basis october to september  on a calendar basis in teva r sales will be relatively flat in comparison to net sales of the simple r product line decreased by from to the company currently expects the decline to continue at least through the first half of  with a potential for improvement in the latter half of the year 
for the full year  the company expects that sales of simple r in will be flat to down slightly in comparison to whereas ugg r sales declined by in  the company expects that sales of ugg will increase in in comparison to in an effort to position the company for growth in  the company currently plans to increase spending in on advertising  research and development  international sales operations  teva r apparel infrastructure and continued improvements in the company s management information systems 
while the company currently expects that it will fund a portion of these increased expenditures from efficiencies gained elsewhere  the company currently expects that there will be a net increase in the company s operating expenses as a percentage of sales in comparison to the foregoing forward looking statements represent the company s current analysis of trends and information 
actual results could be affected by a variety of factors 
for example  the company s results are directly dependent on consumer preferences  which are difficult to assess and can shift rapidly 
any shift in consumer preferences away from one or more of the company s product lines could result in lower sales as well as obsolete inventory  both of which would adversely affect the company s results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the company is also dependent on its customers continuing to carry and promote its various lines 
availability of product can also affect the company s ability to meet its customers orders 
in addition  sales of each of the company s different lines have historically been higher in different seasons  with the highest percentage of teva r sales occurring in the first and second quarter of each year  the highest percentage of simple r sales occurring in the third quarter and the highest percentage of ugg r sales occurring in the fourth quarter 
consequently  the results for these product lines are highly dependent on results during these specified periods 
sales of the company s products  particularly those under the teva and ugg lines  are very sensitive to weather conditions 
in recent months  large segments of the united states  particularly on the east and west coasts  have experienced severe weather conditions due to the el nino weather phenomenon 
the effects of such weather conditions cannot be determined by the company 
in addition  the company s ability to maintain or expand its european distribution could be impacted by the european commission s enactment of anti dumping duty provisions on certain types of footwear produced in china  if it is determined that certain styles of the company s footwear fall under such anti dumping provisions

the company cautions the reader not to rely on the forward looking statements in this section 
they merely represent the company s current assessment of trends and information and may not be indicative of actual future results 
the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward looking statements

a portion of the purchase price for ugg holdings  inc included periodic payments through the year  some of which were based on formulas tied to net sales and earnings before taxes 
in  some of the former shareholders of ugg holdings gave notice of a demand for arbitration regarding the periodic payments and in september  the company and the former ugg shareholders arrived at a settlement agreement 
in addition  the remaining former ugg shareholders who were not a party to the arbitration agreed to accept the same economic terms as those involved in the arbitration 
under the terms of the settlement  the company and all former shareholders of ugg agreed to final payments aggregating million 
of this  approximately  was paid in december and the balance of  was paid in january these payments replaced all future earn out payments that were to be paid through the year in accordance with the original acquisition agreement  including the  final payment 
the corresponding increase to goodwill has been reflected in the december  consolidated financial statements 
in february  the company s board of directors approved an increase in the number of shares of common stock authorized for repurchase under its existing stock repurchase program from  shares to  shares 
such repurchases shall occur from time to time in open market or in privately negotiated transactions  subject to price and market conditions 
under this program  the company repurchased  shares in for cash consideration of  and  shares in for cash consideration of  the company believes that internally generated funds  the available borrowings under its existing credit facilities and the cash on hand will provide sufficient liquidity to enable it to meet its current and foreseeable working capital requirements 
year issue the year issue results from computer programs written using two digits to identify the year in the date field 
these computer programs were designed and developed without consideration of the impact of the upcoming change in the century 
if not corrected  those programs could create erroneous information by or at the year the company is assessing the internal readiness of its computer systems for handling the year issue 
the company expects to implement the systems and programming changes necessary to address year issues with respect to its internal systems and does not believe that the cost of such actions will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition 
although the company is not aware of any material operational issues or costs associated with preparing its internal systems for the year  there can be no assurance that there will not be a delay in  or increased costs associated with  the implementation of the necessary systems and changes to address the year issues  and the company s inability to implement such systems and changes in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on future results of operations 
the company is in the process of evaluating the extent to which the company is vulnerable to third parties failure to address their own year issues 
those parties include customers  suppliers and other third party business partners 
the company has not yet completed a review process with respect to these third parties 
as a result  the company cannot determine at this time the extent  if any  to which the company may be exposed to financial risk from the inability of the company s customers  suppliers and other business partners to remediate their own year issues 
seasonality financial results for the outdoor and footwear industries are generally seasonal 
based on the company s historical product mix  the company would expect greater sales in the first and second quarters than in the third and fourth quarters 
other the company believes that the relatively moderate rates of inflation in recent years have not had a significant impact on its net sales or profitability
