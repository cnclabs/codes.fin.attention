item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview comptek research  inc the company  through its wholly owned subsidiary  comptek federal systems  inc cfs  designs and develops dedicated defense related systems  software  and proprietary products intended for the global military electronics market 
these defense related systems provide management information and implement offensive and defensive responses in combat situations 
additionally  the company is a highly specialized developer of electronic warfare simulation  training  and software validation systems related to electronic surveillance 
the company also provides value based engineering and technical life cycle support services for several core competency related tactical military systems 
after the close of its fiscal year  the company completed the purchase of prb associates  inc prb 
the company s financial results for fiscal year were not affected by the acquisition of prb 
the company expects  however  that prb will be a substantial factor in the company s future operations and financial condition 
prb is a leader in the development of military mission planning systems used to automate complex planning functions for routing  fuel  ordnance  and tactics for the most advanced aircraft weapons systems 
prb s planning systems and modules are used for strategic and tactical weapons planning 
prb also designs and produces mission support and analysis equipment 
prb s annual net sales  prior to the acquisition by the company  were approximately million  with the majority of such sales attributable to domestic activities 
prb will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
pro forma financial information regarding prb is presented in note of the consolidated financial statements 
the company operates two business segments defense systems systems and engineering and technical services services 
the company s systems and services are provided primarily through three types of contracts fixed price  cost reimbursement  and time and materials 
fixed price contracts require the company to provide products and perform services at a stipulated price 
under cost reimbursement contracts  the company is reimbursed for all actual costs incurred in performing the contract  to the extent that such costs are within the contract ceiling and allowable under the terms of the contract  plus a fee or profit 
time and materials contracts reimburse the company for the number of labor hours expended at an established hourly rate negotiated in the contract  plus the cost of materials incurred 
the company assumes greater financial risk on fixed price contracts than on either cost reimbursement or time and materials contracts 
however  fixed price contracts typically provide the company with greater profit opportunities 
historically  the services segment has primarily performed under time and materials and cost reimbursement contracts  while the systems segment has typically operated under fixed price contracts 
although prb primarily will operate under the systems segment  approximately of prb s current contracts are cost reimbursable 
the us department of defense dod  the company s principal customer group which accounted for approximately of sales  in  and in  has reduced overall spending in real dollars 
future dod spending for military electronics may  however  increase slightly as major systems are upgraded or replaced 
the company does not currently expect to be materially adversely affected by these dod spending trends  as its backlog of orders during the last two fiscal years has been at historically record high levels 
no assurances  however  can be given that trends in dod spending  or other shifts in procurement practices of the dod  will not adversely affect the company 
in this dod spending environment  competition for new procurements is intense and industry consolidation via mergers and acquisitions is commonplace 
the company has completed two acquisitions in the last two years and considers future acquisitions to be a key element in its business plan 
the company expects these trends to affect virtually all defense contractors in varying degrees 
additionally  the government  specifically dod  continues to place emphasis on audit and investigative activities which present risks of unanticipated financial exposure for companies with substantial activity in government contract work 
the audit process is an on going one that includes post award reviews and audits of compliance with various procurement requirements 
government regulations provide that under certain circumstances a contractor may be fined  penalized  have its progress payments withheld or be debarred from contracting with the government 
the company believes that it maintains adequate internal systems to ensure compliance with these requirements and  therefore  does not anticipate a material adverse financial impact from the various and on going procurement reviews 
the final billing on certain contracts is subject to the dod s completion of audits  which can result in adjustments to final contract costs and fees 
these audits have been completed for all fiscal years through  without material adjustments 
however  there are no assurances that future adjustments will not be required 
the company s government contracts are subject to termination at the government s convenience  without cause 
if a government contract was terminated for convenience  the company would typically be reimbursed for its allowable costs to the date of termination and be paid a proportionate amount of the stipulated profit or fee for the work actually performed 
the company has not been materially adversely affected by the termination of any government contract
