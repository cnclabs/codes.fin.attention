the company s need for cash varies from quarter to quarter based on product releases and scheduled marketing promotions 
the company s principal uses of cash historically have been operating expenses  capital expenditures and debt service 
the most significant cash outlays for investing purposes generally result from product development which primarily involves the production and recording of the company s product master library 
it is from these masters that the company s products are duplicated and then distributed to customers

the lender received warrants exercisable for up to of the company s class a common stock  with an exercise price of  and the warrants expire in years 
under the terms of the financing agreement  the lender cannot exercise the warrants until august unless the company undergoes a change in control 
the company believes that funds generated from operations and funds available under its credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy its current operating requirements 
capital expenditures totaled  and  in the years ended december  and during  capital expenditures were primarily for computer equipment and general repairs on corporate headquarters 
during  capital expenditures were primarily the result of safeguarding the new building from the elements 
the capital expenditure budget for is seasonality retail sales are typically higher in the third and fourth quarters because of holiday promotions 
direct to consumer sales are typically higher in the first quarter as a result of significant marketing promotions in late december 
direct to consumer promotions require a build up in inventory in the fourth quarter and as a result  sales and accounts receivable increase in the first quarter 
it is important to note that sales from quarter to quarter depend heavily on marketing promotions and new product releases 
accordingly  results of operations in any one quarter may not be indicative of results of operations for the entire year 
inflation the impact of inflation on the company s operating results has been moderate in recent years  reflecting generally lower rates of inflation in the economy and relative stability in the company s cost of sales 
in prior years  the company has been able to adjust its selling prices to substantially recover increased costs 
while inflation has not had  and the company does not expect that it will have  a material impact upon operating results  there is no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
year compliance it is possible that the company s currently installed computer systems  software products or other business systems  or those of others with whom the company interfaces with  will not always accept input of  store  manipulate and output dates in the years  or thereafter without error or interruption 
the company has conducted a review of its in house computer systems and is not aware of any material year compliance problems 
in addition  the company is reviewing its third party systems to ensure that such systems are year compliant 
while the company is not aware of any material expenses or losses of revenue that it will incur as a result of year problems  it is impossible to anticipate all of the ways in which such problems could arise and affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurances that the expenses or liabilities to which the company may become subject as a result of such problems will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
factors affecting future performance competition the company faces intense competition for discretionary consumer spending from numerous other record companies and other forms of entertainment offered by film companies  video companies and others 
integrity competes directly with other record companies and music publishers that distribute christian music to christian bookstores  as well as a number of secular record companies  many of whom have substantially greater financial resources than the company 
the company also competes with other record and music publishing companies  both christian and secular  for signing established and new artists and songwriters 
the company s ability to continue to compete successfully will be largely dependent upon its ability to build upon and maintain its reputation for quality christian music and other communication products 
risks inherent in the industry the industries integrity operates in  recorded music  video productions and printed music  are creative industries  and involve a substantial degree of risk 
each musical or video recording or printed product is an individual artistic work  and its commercial success is primarily determined by consumer taste  which is unpredictable and constantly changing 
accordingly  there can be no assurance as to the financial success of any particular release  the timing of such success or the popularity of any particular artist 
furthermore  the company must invest significant amounts for product development prior to the release of any product  which costs may not be recovered if the release is unsuccessful 
changes in the timing of new releases can also cause significant fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
there can be no assurance that the company s products will be successful releases or that any product will generate revenues sufficient to cover the cost of product development 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
business strategy integrity s business strategy is focused on developing new music  video and printed products aimed at the contemporary christian market segments and broadening its distribution channels to reach additional customers in the domestic and international markets 
the company s ability to achieve these objectives depends upon many factors  including developing new concept products  signing and retaining artists  and maintaining an effective sales effort capable of expanding the company s operations into new market segments 
in all of these endeavors  the company may compete with entities which have significantly greater resources than the company 
there can be no assurance that quality artists and songs will continue to be available to integrity  that the company will be able to produce and promote products which maintain the interest of the general market or its record club members or that the company will be able to penetrate effectively new segments of the christian products market or the general market 
change to the smallcap market on february   new listing and maintenance rules for inclusion on both the nasdaq national market and the smallcap market became effective 
under these new rules  the company failed to meet one of the listing requirements for the nasdaq national market  specifically the market value of its publicly traded shares 
as a result  the company has elected to transfer its class a common stock to the smallcap market 
at this time  the effective date of the transition to the smallcap market is unknown 
there can be no assurances that the company s transition to and position in the smallcap market will result in an active trading market for the company s class a common stock 
increases in costs of mailing  paper  printing and delivery increases in postal rates  as well as in paper  printing and delivery costs affect the operating results of the company s direct response programs 
the company s orders are shipped primarily by third class mail with the united states postal service 
the company relies heavily on discounts from the basic postal rate structure  such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting by zip code and carrier routes 
any increase in postal rates  papers and printing costs or delivery costs could have an adverse effect on earnings 
piracy and home taping the company operates in an industry in which revenues are adversely affected by the unauthorized reproduction of recordings for commercial sale  commonly referred to as piracy  and by home taping for personal use 
there can be no assurances that piracy and home taping for personal use will not have an adverse affect on the financial condition and operations of the company 
dependence on senior management the success of the company has been largely dependent on the skills  experience and efforts of its senior management and especially its chairman  president and chief executive officer  p 
michael coleman 
the loss of the services of mr 
coleman or other members of the company s senior management could have a material adverse affect on the company s business prospects 
control of company p 
michael coleman  chairman  president and chief executive officer of the company  and his family beneficially own  share of class a common stock and all  shares of class b common stock outstanding  representing approximately of the total voting power of all classes of voting stock of the company 
as a result  mr 
coleman will be able to elect all of the company s directors  amend the amended certificate of incorporation the amended certificate  effect or prevent a merger  sale of assets or other business acquisition or disposition and otherwise control the outcome of actions requiring stockholder approval 
see security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management and certain relationships and related transactions 
limited voting rights of class a common stock the voting rights of the class a common stock are limited by the amended certificate 
on all matters with respect to which the company s stockholders have a right to vote  including the election of directors  each share of class a common stock is entitled to one vote  while each share of class b common stock is entitled to ten votes 
except as otherwise required by law or expressly provided in the amended certificate  the class a common stock and class b common stock vote together as a single class 
class b common stock can be converted into shares of class a common stock on a share for share basis at the election of the holder and shall be converted to shares of class a common stock automatically on transfer  except for transfers to mr 
coleman s spouse and descendants or trusts or partnerships for their benefit 
the amended certificate limits the company s authority to issue additional class b common stock except as dividends or distributions on outstanding class b common stock proportional to dividends or distributions on class a common stock 
the disproportionate voting rights between the class a common stock and the class b common stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of the class a common stock 
such disproportionate voting rights may make the company a less attractive target for a takeover than it otherwise might be  or render more difficult or discourage a merger proposal  a tender offer or a proxy contest  even if such actions were favored by holders of the company s class a common stock 
such disproportionate voting rights may also deprive holders of class a common stock of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over then prevailing market prices for the class a common stock 
effect of certain anti takeover provisions the amended certificate authorizes the board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock  
per share the preferred stock from time to time in one or more designated series or classes 
the board of directors  without approval of the stockholders  is authorized to establish voting  dividend  redemption  conversion  liquidation and other provisions of a particular series or class of preferred stock 
the issuance of preferred stock could  among other things  adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of common stock and  under certain circumstances  make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or discourage a third party from acquiring  control of the company 
in addition  the company is subject to the delaware business combination statute  which may render more difficult a change in control of the company
