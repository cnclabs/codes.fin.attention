item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is a diversified financial services company engaged in residential and commercial mortgage banking  portfolio asset acquisition and resolution and consumer lending 
the mortgage banking business involves the origination  acquisition and servicing of residential and commercial mortgage loans and the subsequent warehousing  sale or securitization of such loans through various public and private secondary markets 
the portfolio asset acquisition and resolution business involves acquiring portfolio assets at a discount to face value and servicing and resolving such portfolios in an effort to maximize the present value of the ultimate cash recoveries 
the company also seeks opportunities to originate and retain high yield commercial loans to businesses and to finance real estate projects that are unable to access traditional lending sources 
the consumer lending business involves the acquisition  origination  warehousing  securitization and servicing of consumer receivables 
the company s current consumer lending operations are focused on the acquisition of sub prime automobile receivables 
the company s financial results are affected by many factors including levels of and fluctuations in interest rates  fluctuations in the underlying values of real estate and other assets  and the availability and prices for loans and assets acquired in all of the company s businesses 
the company s business and results of operations are also affected by the availability of financing with terms acceptable to the company and the company s access to capital markets  including the securitization markets 
the company consummated the merger of j hawk and fcbot in july the company s financial statements reflect the merger as an acquisition of fcbot by j hawk 
for periods prior to july with the exception of the restatement for the harbor merger  the company s financial statements reflect the activities of j hawk 
during such periods  j hawk was principally engaged in the portfolio asset acquisition and resolution business 
the harbor merger  which occurred in july  was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
the company s historical financial statements have therefore been retroactively restated to include the financial position and results of operations of mortgage corp 
for all periods presented 
as a result of the merger  the harbor merger and the significant period to period fluctuations in the revenues and earnings of the company s portfolio asset acquisition and resolution business  period to period comparisons of the company s results of operations may not be meaningful

mortgage banking the primary components of revenues derived by mortgage corp 
and capital corp 
are net mortgage warehouse income  gain on sale of mortgage loans  servicing fees earned for loan servicing activities  and other miscellaneous sources of revenues associated with the origination and servicing of residential and commercial mortgages 
the principal components of expenses of mortgage corp 
and capital corp 
are salaries and employee benefits  amortization of originated and acquired mortgage servicing rights  interest expense and other general and administrative expenses 
the following paragraphs describe the principal factors affecting each of the significant components of revenues of mortgage corp 
and capital corp 
the following table presents selected information regarding the revenues and expenses of the company s mortgage banking business 
analysis of selected revenues and expenses mortgage banking year ended december  dollars in thousands warehouse inventory average inventory balance    net mortgage warehouse income dollar amount    percentage of average inventory balance gain on sale of mortgage loans gain on sale of mortgage loans as a percentage of loans sold residential home equity omsr income as a percentage of residential mortgage loans sold servicing revenues average servicing portfolios residential    commercial    sub serviced   servicing fees residential    commercial sub serviced total    annualized servicing fee percentage residential commercial sub serviced gain on sale of servicing rights    amortization of servicing rights servicing rights amortization    servicing rights amortization as a percentage of average servicing portfolio personnel personnel expenses    number of personnel at period end production servicing other total salaried commission net mortgage warehouse income mortgage corp 
originates or acquires residential mortgage loans  which are recorded as mortgage loans held for sale and financed under warehouse credit facilities pending sale 
the difference between interest income on the originated or acquired loans and the cost of warehouse borrowings is recorded as net mortgage warehouse income 
the amount of recorded net mortgage warehouse income varies with the average volume of loans in the warehouse and the spread between the coupon rate of interest on the loans and the interest cost of the warehouse credit facility 
gain on sale of mortgage loans residential mortgage loans originated or acquired by mortgage corp 
currently are accumulated in inventory and held for sale 
the disposition of the loans generally produces a gain 
such gains result from the cash sale of the mortgage loans and the additional recognition of the value of mortgage servicing rights as proceeds  less the basis of the mortgage loans sold 
as of december   capital corp 
had not completed a securitization of home equity loans 
the portion of the company s mortgage banking business conducted through capital corp 
is devoted to the acquisition of home equity loans with the expectation that they will be pooled and sold in public or private securitization transactions 
gains on the securitization and sale of home equity loans represent the amount by which the proceeds received including the estimated value of retained subordinated interests exceed the basis of the home equity loans and the costs associated with the securitization process 
the retained interests will be valued at the discounted present value of the cash flows expected to be realized over the anticipated average life of the assets sold after deducting future estimated credit losses  estimated prepayments  servicing fees and other securitization fees related to the home equity loans sold 
the recorded value of retained interests will be computed using capital corp 
s assumptions of market discount rates  prepayment speeds  default rates  credit losses and other costs based upon the unique underlying characteristics of the home equity loans comprising each securitization 
capital corp 
expects that the assumptions it will use in its securitization transactions will include discount rates of and prepayment speeds at annualized rates starting at approximately per year and  depending upon the mix of fixed and variable rate and prepayment penalty provisions of the underlying loans  increasing to to per year 
loss assumptions are expected to vary depending upon the mix of the credit quality and loan to value characteristics of the underlying loans that are securitized 
the actual assumptions used by capital corp 
in its securitization transactions will vary based on numerous factors  including those listed above  and there can be no assurance that actual assumptions will correspond to capital corp 
s current expectations 
servicing fees and amortization of mortgage servicing rights a significant component of mortgage corp 
s residential mortgage banking business is attributable to the future right to service the residential mortgage loans it originates or acquires 
mortgage corp 
generally retains the servicing right upon the sale of the originated loan and expects to retain such rights upon securitization and records the value of such right as mortgage servicing rights on its balance sheet 
subsequently  mortgage corp 
earns revenues as compensation for the servicing activities it performs 
mortgage corp 
amortizes the mortgage servicing right asset as a periodic expense to allocate the cost of the servicing right to the income generated on a periodic basis 
the recorded values of mortgage servicing rights are reviewed on a quarterly basis by comparing the fair market value of these rights as determined by a third party to their recorded values 
based on this review  mortgage corp 
either adjusts amortization rates of such mortgage servicing rights or  if there is any impairment in value  records a charge to earnings in the period during which such impairment is deemed to have occurred 
the fair market value of mortgage servicing rights is heavily impacted by the relative levels of residential mortgage interest rates 
when interest rates decline  underlying loan prepayment speeds generally increase 
prepayments in excess of anticipated levels will cause actual fair market values of mortgage servicing rights to be less than recorded values thereby resulting in increases in the rates of amortization  or a revaluation of recorded mortgage servicing rights as described above 
a decline in interest rates generally contributes to higher levels of mortgage loan origination particularly refinancings and the related recognition of increased levels of gain on sale of mortgage loans 
the ability of mortgage corp 
to originate loans and its ability to regenerate the recorded value of its servicing portfolio on an annualized basis also provides mortgage corp 
with the ability to approximately replace the recorded value of its residential servicing portfolio in a one year time frame  based upon current origination levels 
loans originated during periods of relatively low interest rates generate servicing rights with a higher overall value due to the decreased probability of future prepayment by the borrower 
accordingly  mortgage corp 
believes that it has an inherent hedge against a significant and swift decline in the value of its recorded mortgage servicing rights 
there can be no assurance that  in the long term  mortgage corp 
will be able to continue to maintain an even balance between the production capacity of its origination network and the principal value of its servicing portfolio 
in an environment of increasing interest rates  the rate of current and projected future prepayments decreases  resulting in increases in fair market values of mortgage servicing rights 
although the company does not recognize gain as a result of such increases in fair market values  it may decrease the rate of amortization of the mortgage servicing rights 
in addition  in periods of rising interest rates  mortgage loan origination rates generally decline 
other in its commercial mortgage business  mortgage corp 
generates loan origination fees paid by commercial borrowers for underwriting and application activities performed by mortgage corp 
as a correspondent of various insurance company and conduit lenders 
in addition  mortgage corp 
generates other fees and revenues from various activities associated with originating and servicing residential and commercial mortgage loans and in its construction lending activities 
mortgage corp 
has in the past sold  and may in the future sell  a portion of its rights to service residential mortgage loans 
the results of such sales are recorded as gains on sales of mortgage servicing rights and reflected as a component of other revenue 
portfolio asset acquisition and resolution revenues at commercial corp 
consist primarily of cash proceeds on disposition of assets acquired in portfolio asset acquisitions for commercial corp 
s own account and its equity in the earnings of affiliated acquisition partnerships 
in addition  commercial corp 
derives servicing fees from acquisition partnerships for the servicing activities performed related to the assets held in the acquisition partnerships 
following the merger  commercial corp 
serviced assets held in an affiliated liquidating trust created for the benefit of former fcbot shareholders the trust and derived servicing fees for its activities under a servicing agreement between the trust and commercial corp 
during the first quarter of  the trust terminated the servicing agreement and paid commercial corp 
a termination payment of million representing the present value of servicing fees projected to have been earned by commercial corp 
upon the liquidation of the assets of the trust  which was expected to occur principally in in its portfolio asset acquisition and resolution business  commercial corp 
acquires portfolio assets that are designated as nonperforming  performing or real estate 
each portfolio is accounted for as a whole and not on an individual asset basis 
to date  a substantial majority of the portfolio assets acquired by commercial corp 
have been designated as nonperforming 
once a portfolio has been designated as either nonperforming or performing  such designation is not changed regardless of the performance of the assets comprising the portfolio 
the company recognizes revenue from portfolio assets and acquisition partnerships based on proceeds realized from the resolution of portfolio assets  which proceeds have historically varied significantly and likely will continue to vary significantly from period to period 
the following table presents selected information regarding the revenues and expenses of the company s portfolio asset acquisition and resolution business

portfolio assets are designated as nonperforming unless substantially all of the assets comprising the portfolio are being repaid in accordance with the contractual terms of the underlying loan agreements 
commercial corp 
acquires such assets on the basis of an evaluation of the timing and amount of cash flow expected to be derived from borrower payments or disposition of the underlying asset securing the loan 
on a monthly basis  the amortized cost of each nonperforming portfolio is evaluated for impairment 
a valuation allowance is established for any impairment identified with provisions to establish such allowance charged to earnings in the period identified 
all nonperforming portfolio assets are purchased at substantial discounts from their face value 
net gain on the resolution of nonperforming portfolio assets is recognized to the extent that proceeds collected on the portfolio exceed a pro rata portion of allocated costs of the resolved portfolio assets 
proceeds from the resolution of portfolio assets that are nonperforming are recognized as cash is realized from the collection  disposition and other resolution activities associated with the portfolio assets 
no interest income or any other yield component of revenue is recognized separately on nonperforming portfolio assets 
performing portfolio assets performing portfolio assets consist of consumer and commercial loans acquired at a discount from the aggregate amount of face value 
portfolio assets are classified as performing if substantially all of the loans comprising the portfolio are being repaid in accordance with the contractual terms of the underlying loan agreements 
on a monthly basis  the amortized cost of each performing portfolio is evaluated for impairment 
a valuation allowance is established for any identified impairment with provisions to establish such allowance charged to earnings in the period identified 
interest income is recognized when accrued in accordance with the contractual terms of the loans 
the accrual of interest is discontinued once a loan becomes past due days or more 
acquisition discounts for the portfolio assets as a whole are accreted as an adjustment to yield over the estimated life of the portfolio 
real estate portfolios commercial corp 
also acquires portfolios comprised solely of real estate 
real estate portfolios are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
costs relating to the development or improvement are capitalized and costs relating to holding assets are charged to expense as incurred 
rental income  net of expenses  is recognized as revenue when received 
gains and losses are recognized based on the allocated cost of each specific real estate asset 
equity in earnings of acquisition partnerships commercial corp 
accounts for its investments in acquisition partnerships using the equity method of accounting 
this accounting method generally results in the pass through of its pro rata share of earnings from the acquisition partnerships activities as if it had a direct investment in the underlying portfolio assets held by the acquisition partnership 
the revenues and earnings of the acquisition partnerships are determined on a basis consistent with the accounting methodology applied to nonperforming  performing and real estate portfolios described in the preceding paragraphs 
distributions of cash flow from the acquisition partnerships are a function of the terms and covenants of the loan agreements related to the secured borrowings of the acquisition partnerships 
generally  the terms of the underlying loan agreements permit some distribution of cash flow to the equity partners so long as loan to cost and loan to value relationships are in compliance with the terms and covenants of the applicable loan agreement 
once the secured borrowings of the acquisition partnerships are fully paid  all cash flow in excess of operating expenses is available for distribution to the equity partners

also derived servicing fees from the servicing of assets held in the trust 
in connection with the acquisition partnerships  commercial corp 
earns a servicing fee of between and of gross cash collections generated by the acquisition partnerships  rather than a periodic management fee based on the face value of the assets being serviced 
the rate of servicing fee charged is a function of the average face value of the assets within each portfolio being serviced the larger the average face value of the assets in a portfolio  the lower the fee percentage within the prescribed range 
consumer lending the primary components of revenue derived by consumer corp 
are interest income and gain on sale of loans 
the primary expenses of consumer corp 
are salaries and benefits  provision for loan losses and interest expense

the accrual of interest income is discontinued once a loan becomes days past due 
gain on sale of loans funding corp 
intends to accumulate and pool automobile loans acquired from franchised dealerships for sales in public and private securitization transactions 
such transactions are expected to result in the recognition of gains to the extent that the proceeds received including the estimated value of the retained subordinated interests exceed the basis of the automobile loans and the costs associated with the securitization process 
when the automobile loans are securitized and sold  the retained interests will be valued at the discounted present value of the cash flows expected to be realized over the anticipated average life of the assets sold after future estimated credit losses  estimated prepayments  servicing fees and other securitization fees related to the loans sold 
the discounted present value of such interests will be computed using consumer corp 
s assumptions of market discount rates  prepayment speeds  default rates  credit losses and other costs based upon the unique underlying characteristics of the automobile loans comprising each securitization 
in its securitization transaction completed in  consumer corp 
assumed that losses would approximate an aggregate of of the outstanding principal balance of the underlying loans 
consumer corp 
calculated the present value of future cash flows from the securitization using discount rates of to per year 
provision for loan losses the carrying value of consumer loans is evaluated on a monthly basis for impairment 
a valuation allowance is established for any impairment identified with provisions to augment the allowance charged to earnings in the period identified 
the evaluation of the need for an allowance is determined on a pool basis  with each pool being the loans originated or acquired during a quarterly period of production or acquisition 
loans generally are acquired at a discount from the face value of the loan with the acquisition discount established as an allowance for losses at the acquisition date of the loan 
if the initially established allowance is deemed to be insufficient  additional allowances are established through provisions charged to earnings 
the operating margin of consumer corp 
was significantly impacted by provisions for loan losses in the amount of approximately million related to the loans originated in consumer corp 
s sub prime auto receivable business 
the company s initial venture into the sub prime automobile market involved the acquisition of a distressed sub prime portfolio from a secured lender 
following the acquisition of the portfolio  the company began the acquisition of additional loans on an indirect basis from financial institutions who originated loans pursuant to contractual agreements with a subsidiary of consumer corp 
the company concluded that the contractual underwriting standards and the purchase discounts on which the initial program was based were insufficient to generate automobile loans of acceptable quality to the company 
as a result  the company terminated its obligations with the financial institutions participating in the original origination program effective january  the continued flow of production into will require that the company continue to provide for the losses anticipated on such loans in based upon the experience gained with its initial consumer origination program  the company undertook to develop an origination and underwriting approach that would give consumer corp 
significantly greater control over the origination and pricing standards governing its consumer lending activities 
the formation of funding corp 
resulted from these development activities 
the underwriting process and purchase discount methodology employed by funding corp 
has significantly changed the underwriting criteria and purchase standards of consumer corp 
from the methodology employed during the majority of and in funding corp 
s case  the objectives established for purchasing loans from originating dealers are designed to result in the purchase discount equaling or exceeding the expected loss for all loans acquired 
benefit provision for income taxes as a result of the merger  the company has substantial federal nols  which can be used to offset the tax liability associated with the company s pre tax earnings until the earlier of the expiration or utilization of such nols 
the company accounts for the benefit of the nols by recording the benefit as an asset and then establishing an allowance to value the net deferred tax asset at a value commensurate with the company s expectation of being able to utilize the recognized benefit in the next three to four year period 
such estimates are reevaluated on a quarterly basis with the adjustment to the allowance recorded as an adjustment to the income tax expense generated by the quarterly earnings 
significant events that change the company s view of its currently estimated ability to utilize the tax benefits  such as the harbor merger in the third quarter of  result in substantial changes to the estimated allowance required to value the deferred tax benefits recognized in the company s periodic financial statements 
similar events could occur in the future  and would impact the quarterly recognition of the company s estimate of the required valuation allowance associated with its nols 
earnings for and were significantly increased by the recognition of tax benefits resulting from the company s reassessment of the valuation allowance related to its nol asset 
realization of the asset is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable earnings to utilize the nol 
prior to  the deferred tax asset resulting from the company s nol was entirely offset by its valuation reserve 
in and  the valuation reserve was adjusted based on the company s estimate of its future pre tax income 
the amount of tax benefits recognized will be adjusted in future periods should the estimates of future taxable income change 
if there are changes in the estimated level of the required reserve  net earnings will be affected accordingly 
firstcity liquidating trust and exchange of preferred stock in connection with the merger  the company received the class a certificate of the trust the class a certificate 
distributions from the trust in respect of the class a certificate were used to retire the senior subordinated notes of the company and to pay dividends on  and repurchase some of  the special preferred stock of the company the special preferred 
pursuant to a june settlement agreement with the company  the trust s obligation to the company under the class a certificate was terminated other than the trust s obligation to reimburse the company for certain expenses in exchange for the trust s agreement to pay the company an amount equal to per share for the  shares of special preferred outstanding at june   the second quarter dividend of per share  and interest from june  on any unpaid portion of the settlement agreement 
under such agreement  the company assumes the obligation for the payment of the liquidation preference amount and the future dividends on the special preferred 
as of december   the trust had distributed million to the company under the settlement agreement 
in june  the company began an offer to exchange one share of newly issued adjusting rate preferred stock adjusting rate preferred for each outstanding share of special preferred 
the company completed such exchange offer in the third quarter of pursuant to which  shares of special preferred were tendered for a like number of shares of adjusting rate preferred 
the special preferred has a redemption value of per share  a annual dividend rate and a redemption date of september  the adjusting rate preferred has a redemption value of per share and a annual dividend rate through september   at which time the dividend rate is reduced to per annum 
the adjusting rate preferred is redeemable by the company on or after september   with a mandatory maturity date of september  the redemption by the trust of its obligation on the class a certificate represented a premium over the redemption value of the special preferred  which is reflected as a deferred credit in the company s financial statements 
the deferred credit is being accreted to income over the weighted average life of the special preferred and the adjusting rate preferred

the change in the gain on sale percentage recognized in compared to is the result of the sale  on a servicing released basis  of approximately million of home equity loans in net mortgage warehouse income 
net mortgage warehouse income increased by to million in from million in this increase is the result of a significant increase in the average balance of loans held in inventory during the year offset by a decrease in the spread earned between the interest rate on the underlying mortgages and the interest cost of the warehouse credit facility as the overall levels of interest rates on residential mortgage loans reached their lowest levels in several years

operating expenses increased to million in from million in the relatively stable levels of operating expenses incurred by commercial corp 
in compared to reflect the relatively consistent levels of investment and servicing activities associated with commercial corp 
s operations during such periods 
salaries and benefits declined in as a result of the consolidation of some of the servicing offices as the portfolios being serviced in the closed offices reached final resolution

asset level expenses incurred in connection with the servicing of portfolio assets increased in compared to as a result of the increase in investments in portfolio assets in compared to occupancy and other expenses decreased as a result of the consolidation of servicing offices in consumer lending consumer corp 
s revenues and expenses in were derived principally from its original sub prime automobile financing program  which was established during the first quarter of consumer corp 
terminated its obligations to the financial institutions participating in such program effective as of january  in late consumer corp  through its owned subsidiary  funding corp  established a new sub prime automobile financing program through which it originates automobile loans through direct relationships with franchised automobile dealerships 
substantially all of consumer corp 
s activities are expected to be conducted through funding corp 
during interest income 
interest income on consumer loans increased by to million in from million in reflecting increased levels of loan origination activity in as compared to and an increase in the average balance of aggregate loans held by consumer corp 
during interest expense 
interest expense increased by to million in from million in as a result of an increase in the average outstanding level of borrowings secured by automobile receivables to million in from million in the average rate at which such borrowings incurred interest increased to from for the same period 
operating expenses 
salaries and benefits increased by to million in from million in as a result of the increased levels of operating activity in as compared to in addition  during the later portion of  consumer corp 
s operating expenses reflected the duplicative effects of the start up of funding corp 
while still operating the indirect origination program 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses on automobile receivables increased by to million in from million in the increase is attributable to loan originations of million in compared to loan originations of million in consumer corp 
increased its rate of provision for loan losses based on its determination that the discount rate at which it acquired loans under its original origination program did not properly provide for the losses expected to be realized on the acquired loans 
the origination program currently operated by funding corp 
generally allows for the acquisition of loans from automobile dealerships at a larger discount from par than consumer corp 
s original financing program 
the company believes that such acquisition prices more closely approximate the expected loss per occurrence on the loans originated 
to the extent that funding corp 
cannot match such discount to expected losses  additional provisions might  in the future  be required to properly provide for the risk of loss on the loans originated 
the company expects to incur provisions for loan losses in on automobile loans acquired by it during early through its original origination program 
securitization of automobile loans 
during the second quarter of  consumer corp 
completed its first sale and securitization of automobile loans 
consumer corp 
has retained subordinated interests in the form of nonrated tranches and excess spreads resulting from the securitization transaction and reflected an aggregate of million in such interests at december  other items affecting net income the following items affect the company s overall results of operations and are not directly related to any one of the company s businesses discussed above 
corporate overhead 
interest income on the class a certificate during represents reimbursement to the company from the trust of accrual of dividends of million on special preferred stock through june  and interest paid under a june agreement to retire the class a certificate 
company level interest expense declined by to million in from million in as a result of lower volumes of debt associated with the equity required to purchase portfolio assets  equity interests in acquisition partnerships and capital support to operating subsidiaries

liquidity and capital resources generally  the company requires liquidity to fund its operations  working capital  payment of debt  equity for acquisition of portfolio assets  investments in and advances to the acquisition partnerships  investments in expanding businesses to support their growth  retirement of and dividends on preferred stock  and other investments by the company 
the potential sources of liquidity are funds generated from operations  equity distributions from the acquisition partnerships  interest and principal payments on subordinated debt and dividends from the company s subsidiaries  short term borrowings from revolving lines of credit  proceeds from equity market transactions  securitization and other structured finance transactions and other special purpose short term borrowings 
in the future  the company anticipates being able to raise capital through a variety of sources including  but not limited to  public debt or equity offerings subject to limitations related to the preservation of the company s nols  thus enhancing the investment and growth opportunities of the company 
the company believes that these and other sources of liquidity  including refinancing and expanding the company s revolving credit facility to the extent necessary  securitizations  and funding from senior lenders providing funding for acquisition partnership investments and direct portfolio and business acquisitions  should prove adequate to continue to fund the company s contemplated activities and meet its liquidity needs

risk factors risks associated with rapid growth and entry into new businesses following the merger  the company embarked upon a strategic diversification of its business 
previously  the company had been engaged primarily in the portfolio asset acquisition and resolution business 
the company has recently entered the residential and commercial mortgage banking business and the consumer lending business through a combination of acquisitions and the start up of new business ventures 
the entry of the company into these new businesses has resulted in increased demands on the company s personnel and systems 
the development and integration of the new businesses requires the investment of additional capital and the continuous involvement of senior management 
the company also must manage a variety of businesses with differing markets  customer bases  financial products  systems and managements 
an inability to develop  integrate and manage its businesses could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and business prospects 
the company s ability to support and manage continued growth is dependent upon  among other things  its ability to attract and retain senior management for each of its businesses  to hire  train  and manage its workforce and to continue to develop the skills necessary for the company to compete successfully in its existing and new business lines 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully meet all of these challenges 
continuing need for financing general 
the successful execution of the company s business strategy depends on its continued access to financing for each of its major operating subsidiaries 
in addition to the need for such financing  the company must have access to liquidity to invest as equity or subordinated debt to meet the capital needs of its subsidiaries 
liquidity is generated by the cash flow to the company from subsidiaries  access to the public debt and equity markets and borrowings incurred by the company 
the company s access to the capital markets is affected by such factors as changes in interest rates  general economic conditions  and the perception in the capital markets of the company s business  results of operations  leverage  financial condition and business prospects 
in addition  the company s ability to issue and sell common equity including securities convertible into  or exercisable or exchangeable for  common equity is limited as a result of the tax laws relating to the preservation of the nols available to the company as a result of the merger 
there can be no assurance that the company s funding relationships with commercial banks  investment banks and financial services companies including cargill financial that have previously provided financing for the company and its subsidiaries will continue past their respective current maturity dates 
the majority of the credit facilities to which the company and its subsidiaries are parties have short term maturities 
negotiations are underway to extend certain of such credit facilities that are approaching maturity and the company expects that it will be necessary to extend the maturities of other such credit facilities in the near future 
there can be no assurance that such negotiations will be successful 
if such negotiations do not result in the extension of the maturities of such credit facilities and the company or its subsidiaries cannot find alternative funding sources on satisfactory terms  or at all  the company s financial condition  results of operations and business prospects would be materially adversely affected 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
each of the company and its major operating subsidiaries has its own source of debt financing 
in certain circumstances  a default by the company or any of its major operating subsidiaries in respect of indebtedness owed to a third party constitutes a default under the company credit facility 
the credit facilities to which the company s major operating subsidiaries are party do not contain similar cross default or cross acceleration provisions 
although the company intends to continue to segregate the debt obligations of each such subsidiary  there can be no assurance that its existing financing sources will continue to agree to such arrangements or that alternative financing sources that would accept such arrangements would be available 
in the event the company s major operating subsidiaries are compelled to accept cross guarantees  or cross default or cross acceleration provisions in connection with their respective credit facilities  financial difficulties experienced by one of the company s subsidiaries could adversely impact the company s other subsidiaries 
dependence on warehouse financing 
as is customary in the mortgage banking and consumer lending businesses  the company s subsidiaries depend upon warehouse credit facilities with financial institutions or institutional lenders to finance the origination and purchase of loans on a short term basis pending sale or securitization 
implementation of the company s business strategy requires the continued availability of warehouse credit facilities  and may require increases in the permitted borrowing levels under such facilities 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on terms satisfactory to the company 
the inability of the company to arrange additional warehouse credit facilities  to extend or replace existing facilities when they expire or to increase the capacity of such facilities may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and business prospects 
risks of securitization significance of securitization 
the company believes that it will become increasingly dependent upon its ability to securitize home equity loans  sub prime automobile loans and other loans to efficiently finance the volume of assets expected to be generated 
accordingly  adverse changes in the secondary market for such loans could impair the company s ability to originate  purchase and sell loans on a favorable or timely basis 
any such impairment could have a material adverse effect upon the company s financial condition  results of operations and business prospects 
proceeds from the securitization of originated and acquired loans are required to be used to repay borrowings under warehouse credit facilities  thereby making such facilities available to finance the origination and purchase of additional loan assets 
there can be no assurance that  as the company s volume of loans originated or purchased increases and other new products available for securitization increases  the company will be able to securitize its loan production efficiently 
an inability to efficiently securitize its loan production could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and business prospects 
securitization transactions may be affected by a number of factors  some of which are beyond the company s control  including  among other things  the adverse financial condition of  or developments related to  some of the company s competitors  conditions in the securities markets in general  and conditions in the asset backed securitization market 
the company s securitizations typically utilize credit enhancements in the form of financial guaranty insurance policies in order to achieve enhanced credit ratings 
failure to obtain insurance company credit enhancement could adversely affect the timing of  or ability of the company to effect  securitizations 
in addition  the failure to satisfy rating agency requirements with respect to loan pools would adversely impact the company s ability to effect securitizations 
contingent risks 
although the company intends to sell substantially all of the home equity loans  sub prime automobile loans and other consumer loans that it originates or purchases  the company retains some degree of credit risk on substantially all loans sold 
during the period in which loans are held pending sale  the company is subject to various business risks associated with the lending business  including the risk of borrower default  the risk of foreclosure and the risk that a rapid increase in interest rates would result in a decline in the value of loans to potential purchasers 
the company expects that the terms of its securitizations will require it to establish deposit accounts or build over collateralization levels through retention of distributions otherwise payable to the holders of subordinated interests in the securitization 
the company also expects to be required to commit to repurchase or replace loans that do not conform to the representations and warranties made by the company at the time of sale 
retained risks of securitized loans 
the company makes various representations with respect to the loans that it securitizes 
with respect to acquired loans  the company s representations rely in part on similar representations made by the originators of such loans when they were purchased by the company 
in the event of a breach of its representations  the company may be required to repurchase or replace the related loan using its own funds 
while the company may have a claim against the originator in the event of a breach of any of these representations made by the originators  the company s ability to recover on any such claim will be dependent on the financial condition of the originator 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience a material loss in respect of any of these contingencies 
performance assumptions 
capital corp 
and funding corp 
s future net income will be highly dependent on realizing securitization gains on the sale of loans 
such gains will be dependent largely upon the estimated present values of the subordinated interests expected to be derived from the transactions and retained by the company 
management makes a number of assumptions in determining the estimated present values for the subordinated interests 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  prepayment speeds  default rates and subsequent losses on the underlying loans  and the discount rates used to present value the future cash flows 
all of the assumptions are subjective 
varying the assumptions can have a material effect on the present value determination in one securitization as compared to any other 
subsequent events will cause the actual occurrences of prepayments  losses and interest rates to be different from the assumptions used for such factors at the time of the recognition of the sale of the loans 
the effect of the subsequently occurring events could cause a re evaluation of the carrying values of the previously estimated values of the subordinated interests and excess spreads and such adjustment could be material 
because the subordinated interests to be retained by capital corp 
and funding corp 
represent claims to future cash flow that are subordinated to holders of senior interests  capital corp 
and funding corp 
retain a significant portion of the risk of whether the full value of the underlying loans may be realized 
in addition  holders of the senior interests may have the right to receive certain additional payments on account of principal in order to reduce the balance of the senior interests in proportion to the credit enhancement requirements of any particular transaction 
such payments for the benefit of the senior interest holders will delay the payment  if any  of excess cash flow to capital corp 
and funding corp 
as the holder of the subordinated interests 
impact of changing interest rates because most of the company s borrowings are at variable rates of interest  the company will be impacted by fluctuations in interest rates 
the company monitors the interest rate environment and employs hedging strategies designed to mitigate certain effects of changes in interest rates when the company deems such strategies appropriate 
however  certain effects of changes in interest rates  such as increased prepayments of outstanding loans  cannot be mitigated 
fluctuations in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and business prospects 
among other things  a decline in interest rates could result in increased prepayments of outstanding loans  particularly on loans in the servicing portfolio of mortgage corp 
the value of servicing rights is a significant asset of mortgage corp 
as prepayments of serviced mortgages increase  the value of such servicing rights as reflected on the company s balance sheet declines  with a corresponding reduction in income as a result of the impairment of the value of mortgage servicing rights 
although to date the impact of such effect has largely been mitigated by increased production of mortgages from refinancings during periods of declining interest rates  there can be no assurance that new mortgage production will be sufficient to mitigate such effect in the future 
absent a level of new mortgage production sufficient to mitigate the effect of mortgage loan prepayments  the future revenue and earnings of the company will be adversely affected 
in addition to prepayment risks  during periods of declining interest rates  mortgage corp 
experiences higher levels of borrowers who elect not to close on loans for which they have applied because they tend to find loans at lower interest rates 
if mortgage corp 
has entered into commitments to sell such a loan on a forward basis and the prospective borrower fails to close  mortgage corp 
must nevertheless meet its commitment to deliver the contracted for loans at the promised yields 
mortgage corp 
will incur a loss if it is required to deliver loans to an investor at a committed yield higher than current market rates 
a substantial and sustained decline in interest rates also may adversely impact the amount of distressed assets available for purchase by commercial corp 
the value of the company s interest earning assets and liabilities may be directly affected by the level of and fluctuations in interest rates  including the valuation of any residual interests in securitizations that would be severely impacted by increased loan prepayments resulting from declining interest rates 
conversely  a substantial and sustained increase in interest rates could adversely affect the ability of the company to originate loans and could reduce the gains recognized by the company upon their securitization and sale 
fluctuating interest rates also may affect the net interest income earned by the company resulting from the difference between the yield to the company on mortgage and other loans held pending sale and the interest paid by the company for funds borrowed under the company s warehouse credit facilities or otherwise 
credit impaired borrowers the company s sub prime borrowers generally are unable to obtain credit from traditional financial institutions due to factors such as an impaired or poor credit history  low income or another adverse credit event 
the company is subject to various risks associated with these borrowers  including  but not limited to  the risk that the borrowers will not satisfy their debt service obligations and that the realizable value of the assets securing their loans will not be sufficient to repay the borrowers debt 
while the company believes that the underwriting criteria and collection methods it employs enable it to identify and control the higher risks inherent in loans made to such borrowers  and that the interest rates charged compensate the company for the risks inherent in such loans  no assurance can be given that such criteria or methods  or such interest rates  will afford adequate protection against  or compensation for  higher than anticipated delinquencies  foreclosures or losses 
the actual rate of delinquencies  foreclosures or losses could be significantly accelerated by an economic downturn or recession 
consequently  the company s financial condition  results of operations and business prospects could be materially adversely affected 
the company has established an allowance for loan losses through periodic earnings charges and purchase discounts on acquired receivables to cover anticipated loan losses on the loans currently in its portfolio 
no assurance can be given  however  that loan losses in excess of the allowance will not occur in the future or that additional provisions will not be required to provide for adequate allowances in the future 
availability of portfolio assets the portfolio asset acquisition and resolution business is affected by long term cycles in the general economy 
in addition  the volume of domestic portfolio assets available for purchase by investors such as the company has generally declined since as large pools of distressed assets acquired by governmental agencies in the s and early s have been resolved or sold 
the company cannot predict its future annual acquisition volume of portfolio assets 
moreover  future portfolio asset purchases will depend on the availability of portfolios offered for sale  the availability of capital and the company s ability to submit successful bids to purchase portfolio assets 
the acquisition of portfolio assets has become highly competitive in the united states 
this may require the company to acquire portfolio assets at higher prices thereby lowering profit margins on the resolution of such portfolios 
under certain circumstances  the company may choose not to bid for portfolio assets that it believes cannot be acquired at attractive prices 
as a result of all the above factors  portfolio asset purchases  and the revenue derived from the resolution of portfolio assets  may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
availability of net operating loss carryforwards the company believes that  as a result of the merger  approximately million of nols were available to the company to offset future taxable income as of december  since december   the company has generated an additional million in tax operating losses 
accordingly  as of december   the company believes that it has approximately million of nols available to offset future taxable income 
in accordance with the terms of financial accounting standards board statement number relating to accounting for income taxes  the company has established a future utilization equivalent to approximately million of the total million of nols  which equates to a million deferred tax asset on the company s books and records 
however  because the company s position in respect of its nols is based upon factual determinations and upon legal issues with respect to which there is uncertainty and because no ruling has been obtained from the internal revenue service the irs regarding the availability of the nols to the company  there can be no assurance that the irs will not challenge the availability of the company s nols and  if challenged  that the irs will not be successful in disallowing the entire amount of the company s nols  with the result that the company s million deferred tax asset would be reduced or eliminated 
assuming that the million in nols is available to the company  the entire amount of such nols may be carried forward to offset future taxable income of the company until the tax year thereafter  the nols begin to expire 
the ability of the company to utilize such nols will be severely limited if there is a more than ownership change of the company during a three year testing period within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the tax code 
if the company were unable to utilize its nols to offset future taxable income  it would lose significant competitive advantages that it now enjoys 
such advantages include  but are not limited to  the company s ability to offset non cash income recognized by the company in connection with certain securitizations  to generate capital to support its expansion plans on a tax advantaged basis  to offset its and its consolidated subsidiaries pretax income  and to have access to the cash flow that would otherwise be represented by payments of federal tax liabilities 
assumptions underlying portfolio asset performance the purchase price and carrying value of portfolio assets acquired by commercial corp 
are determined largely by estimating expected future cash flows from such assets 
commercial corp 
develops and revises such estimates based on its historical experience and current market conditions  and based on the discount rates that the company believes are appropriate for the assets comprising the portfolios
