item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview of in fiscal etec systems  inc reported a year over year increase of approximately in revenue and a increase in diluted earnings per share after adjustments for nonrecurring charges in the prior year 
these results were achieved despite the difficult period experienced by the semiconductor industry and its suppliers 
the industry has seen the impacts of a dramatic downturn in dram pricing  the asian financial crisis and an unsettled personal computer market driven by new market dynamics  including the below pc 
numerous semiconductor device and equipment manufacturers announced layoffs  plant closings and restructurings etec s success in light of these events is due to its ability to provide critical enabling technology 
the semiconductor industry requires technology from etec  which allows smaller design rules and integration of increasingly complex functions  to keep up with moore s law projections that device performance will double every two years 
in addition to enabling increased performance  advanced masks from etec machines allow new users for semiconductors in a vast array of products 
fiscal brought continued strong demand for etec s advanced products 
the alta r laser beam production tool  introduced in july of  has proven to be the most accepted solution for micron production maskwriting applications 
the mebes  an electron beam raster scan system for high throughput pilot production of micron devices  was introduced in fiscal  and etec shipped its first system prior to the year end 
a second new product introduction  the digirite laser direct imaging system for printed circuit board manufacturing  has been well received by the pcb industry  and the product is entering volume production 
etec designs  develops and manufactures these systems in state of the art facilities 
with new facilities scheduled to be on line in california and oregon in the spring of and a new process laboratory in arizona  etec is expanding its production capabilities and ensuring it maintains the most modern manufacturing and research facilities available 
in addition to these achievements  etec increased its cash position to million  while at the same time repurchasing approximately million of its common stock 
results of operations years ended july  and july  revenue 
revenues comprise primarily sales of the company s mebes r  core r  and alta r mask pattern generation systems  accessories and upgrades  and the provision of technical support  maintenance and other services on such products 
product sales  as a percentage of total revenue  increased from in fiscal to in fiscal  while service revenues decreased from to of total revenue over the same period 
service revenue has not increased at the same rate as product revenue  because average sales prices for the company s product offering have risen faster than the prices that the company has been able to negotiate on service contracts 
moreover  revenue from service contracts does not begin until after the expiration of the product warranty period  which is typically one year 
the company derives most of its revenues from the sale of a small number of systems and upgrades 
as such  any delay in the recognition of revenue for a single system or upgrade can have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations in a particular period 
product revenue increased to million from million for the years ended july  and  respectively 
this increase primarily reflects a change in mix towards new products  which have higher selling prices because of the significant improvements that they offer 
the semiconductor business is currently experiencing some difficulty 
weak demand for semiconductors could translate into reduced demand for masks and cause a softening of the demand for the company s products  which could materially reduce revenue for fiscal service revenue increased to million from million for the years ended july  and  respectively  due primarily to an increase in the number of systems under service contracts 
gross profit 
the company s gross profit on product revenue increased to million from million for the years ended july  and  respectively 
the increase results from an increase in product revenue and the higher product gross margin  which increased to from for the years ended july  and  respectively 
the increase in product gross margin is primarily attributable to changes in product mix towards the company s newer products  which generally have higher gross margins than older products 
the company anticipates that gross margin will remain relatively constant or potentially decline in fiscal margins could be negatively impacted by a number of factors  including lower than expected volume  especially if coupled with costs associated with new manufacturing facilities starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal margins could also be adversely affected by product mix skewing toward older  less expensive mask pattern generation equipment or lower than anticipated margins in the laser direct imaging business the company s interconnect products group where the company does not have significant past experience 
additional pressure on margins could come from continued deterioration of asian currencies relative to the dollar  which would increase the effective cost of the company s products to its customers in that region 
a combination of some or all of these factors may have a material adverse effect on margins in fiscal the company s gross profit on service revenue increased to million from million for the years ended july  and  respectively 
gross margin on service revenue was and for the years ended july  and  respectively 
the static gross profit and decreased gross margin reflect higher revenues from an increase in the number of systems under service contracts  offset by higher costs due to increased personnel required to service the growing installed base and to improve customer satisfaction 
research  development and engineering 
the company s research  development and engineering expenses continue to reflect its commitment to higher levels of product development effort 
these expenses  net of third party funding under cooperative development agreements  increased to million  representing of revenue  from million  representing of revenue  for the years ended july  and  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to expenses incurred in the development of future generation alta and mebes systems  together with costs associated with preparing the initial beta versions of the company s new digirite laser direct imaging system for shipment from the interconnect products group 
funding received under cooperative development contracts was million and million for the years ended july  and  respectively 
the increase is primarily attributable to the achievement of milestones under the cost reimbursement agreement with a private consortium  sematech 
in july the company was awarded a new four year contract to develop advanced multiple electron beam microcolumns for nanolithography 
this award  from the defense advanced research projects agency darpa and the naval air systems command navair  will amount to approximately million 
research and development expense in fiscal could be higher than expected to the extent that the company is unable to meet milestones necessary to secure funding under its cooperative development contracts 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million  representing of revenue  from million  representing of revenue  for the years ended july  and  respectively 
fluctuations in selling  general and administrative expenses were primarily due to increased headcount  offset by reduced sales commissions payable on sales into asia due to the expiration of some agreements during fiscal for fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses can be expected to increase due to a number of factors  including higher distribution overhead for the direct laser imaging products 
the extent of this additional cost is not certain due to the company s limited past experience in this field 
interest expense 
interest expense for the years ended july  and was million and million  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense is attributable to the repayment of term debt during fiscal year interest income and other  net 
interest and other income was million for the year ended july   compared with million in the year ended july  this includes million of interest income generated by the company s investment portfolio for the year ended july   compared with million for the year ended july  this increase is due to the growth of the company s investment portfolio and to the achievement of higher average interest rates 
income tax provision 
the company recorded provisions for income taxes for the years ended july  and of million and million  respectively 
the company s effective tax rate decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal primarily due to increased research and development tax credits and increased benefits from the use of a foreign sales corporation 
years ended july  and july  revenue 
from fiscal to fiscal  product revenues increased faster than service revenues  resulting in an increase in product revenues as a percentage of total revenues from in fiscal to in fiscal product revenue increased to million from million for the years ended july  and  respectively 
this increase reflected the sale of thirteen additional systems  higher average selling prices  changes in product mix and an increase in the sales of accessories and upgrades 
service revenue increased to million from million for the years ended july  and  respectively 
this increase primarily reflected generally higher service activity caused by an increase in the number of systems under service contracts 
gross profit 
the company s gross profit on product revenue increased to million from million for the years ended july  and  respectively 
the increase in gross profit on product revenue was due both to increased product shipments and a higher gross profit margin on product revenue  which increased to from for the years ended july  and  respectively 
the increase in product gross margin was primarily attributable to generally higher selling prices for the company s products and an increase in the level of sales of accessories which tend to have higher gross margins  as well as efficiencies resulting from improvements in manufacturing 
the company s gross profit on service revenue decreased to million from million for the years ended july  and  respectively 
gross margin on service revenue was and for the years ended july  and  respectively 
the decreases in gross profit and gross margin reflected an investment in service personnel and training to support the increasing number of systems serviced 
research  development and engineering 
research  development and engineering expenses  net of third party funding under cooperative development agreements  increased to million  representing of revenue  from million  representing of revenue  for the years ended july  and  respectively 
this increase primarily reflected the company s increased commitment to product development 
in july  the company entered into an agreement with a private consortium  sematech  to develop a maskmaking system for micron device generation production and micron device development 
under the terms of this contract  the company is entitled to receive up to million 
in july  the company fulfilled the first milestone under the contract and received million 
in addition  in june  the company entered into a cost reimbursement research and development agreement with the united states department of defense advanced research projects agency darpa 
no funding was recognized under the darpa agreement during fiscal selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million  representing of revenue  from million  or of revenue  for the years ended july  and  respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to market development fees on certain laser beam systems sold in asia  costs resulting from an increase in staffing  rent for the company s additional facilities  costs associated with being a public company and increased profit sharing 
write off of in process technology acquired 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company acquired all of the shares of ebetech electron beam technology gmbh from vcb  the venture capital company of siemens ag  mrs technology  inc and a group of founding employees for million 
the amount allocated to in process technology of million was written off in the third quarter of fiscal because of the uncertainty as to realization 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain specified liabilities of polyscan  inc in exchange for  shares of the company s common stock 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of million was allocated to in process technology acquired  which the company wrote off in the third quarter of fiscal because of the uncertainty as to realization 
interest expense 
interest expense for the years ended july  and was million and million  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense was attributable to the reduction and refinancing of debt during the fourth quarter of fiscal and to the early repayment of a million term note 
this repayment occurred in may interest income and other  net 
interest and other income was million for the year ended july   compared with million in the year ended july  this includes million of interest income generated by the company s investment portfolio for the year ended july  included in this category for the year ended july  were approximately million of interest earned on the investment of the proceeds from etec s initial public offering the ipo  as well as million of transaction gains on the redemption of the minority interest in etec japan 
income tax provision benefit 
during the year ended july   the company recorded an income tax provision of million 
for the year ended july   the company recorded an income tax benefit of million 
the company s provision for income taxes for the year ended july  reflected the discrete release of valuation allowances and the utilization of tax credits and tax benefits from the use of a foreign sales corporation  partially offset by foreign earnings taxed at higher rates and the write off of in process technology related to the acquisition of ebetech for which the company will not receive a tax benefit 
the benefit for income taxes for the year ended july  primarily reflected taxes payable by the company s foreign subsidiaries offset by a change in the valuation allowance 
extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt 
during the year ended july   the company paid million of its senior secured notes before their due dates 
as a result of this full repayment of the senior secured notes  the company recorded an extraordinary loss of approximately million related to unamortized debt issuance costs 
liquidity and capital resources in addition to its operational cash flows  in fiscal the company entered into agreements with its landlords under which they agreed to make investments of up to million for the construction of additional manufacturing facilities under operating lease arrangements 
the company has used million of the million total in fiscal and believes that approximately million will be used in fiscal and million in fiscal under these agreements 
in fiscal and fiscal the company raised approximately million from sales of its common stock in an initial public offering  two additional public offerings  and a private placement 
in fiscal  the company received million from the sale and leaseback of its headquarters campus 
the company has spent approximately million for net capital expenditures in fiscal  including million in facility construction that was subsequently converted to a construction allowance under an operating lease 
the remaining million of net capital expenditures in fiscal was spent primarily to purchase land and testing and process equipment 
the company has budgeted capital expenditures of approximately million for fiscal  some of which may be financed 
in october  the company purchased approximately acres of land in hayward  california for million 
this site provides the company flexibility for future expansion of its hayward based operations 
in addition  in november  the company completed the purchase of approximately acres of land in hillsboro  oregon for approximately million 
the company is having a new facility constructed on this site to meet development and manufacturing requirements for its laser mask pattern generation products and to back up its electron beam manufacturing capabilities in hayward  california 
the new facilities in hayward and hillsboro are scheduled to be completed in the middle of calendar year the amortization of the cost of these facilities will increase the company s manufacturing costs  starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal there can be no assurance that revenue growth and maintenance of product price levels will be adequate to completely offset these costs 
as of july   the company had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million 
the company believes that existing cash balances including cash equivalents and marketable securities  together with other sources of liquidity  including cash flows from operating activities and amounts available under the existing million revolving line of credit all of which was available at july   will provide adequate cash to fund its operations for at least the next twelve months 
the company also believes that success in its industry requires substantial capital in order to maintain the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they arise 
as such  the company may effect additional equity or debt financings from time to time in the future 
cash flows from operations net cash provided by operations for the fiscal years ended july    and was million  million  and million  respectively 
cash flows from operating activities in fiscal primarily reflected net income of million  depreciation and amortization of million and deferred taxes of million  offset by increases in accounts receivable of million  increases in factored accounts receivable of million  increases in inventory of million and increases in other assets of million 
cash flows from operations in fiscal primarily reflected net income of million  decreased by noncash items which include million of deferred taxes  the write off of in process technology acquired of million  and depreciation and amortization of million  increases in accounts receivable of million and inventory of million  and increases in accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities of million 
cash flows from operations in fiscal primarily reflected net income of million  decreased by noncash items which include million of deferred taxes  partially offset by an extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt of million  the write off of in process technology acquired of million  and depreciation and amortization of million  increases in accounts receivable of million and inventory of million  increases in other assets of million  and increases in accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities of million 
fluctuations in accounts receivable  inventory and current liabilities for all of the above periods were caused primarily by the timing of system orders  the timing of revenue recognition  the increase in unit shipments and the timing of payments to vendors 
the increases in accounts receivable are due to a higher sales volume in comparison to the prior periods  a higher ratio of sales in asia  where payment terms are usually longer than for domestic customers  and shipments of newer technology machines  where customer acceptance is often extended 
the increases in inventory are due to the purchase of raw materials in anticipation of a higher order level than was actually achieved and to an increased level of service parts 
any of these events could recur in fiscal also  in fiscal there is risk that receivables could increase disproportionately to increased revenue due to continued difficulties for the company s asian customers  as well as adverse credit and collection experience for sales of direct laser imaging products  which is a new business for the company 
inventories in fiscal could be adversely affected by the inability of the company to achieve its expected unit sale volume  due to the same factors discussed under revenue  above  coupled with inability to cancel or delay orders for raw materials 
prior to the shipment of a system  the company generally receives payment for a portion of the system sales price 
such payments are generally received when the company accepts an order and at various points while the system is being installed and thereafter 
therefore  the amount of customer advances at each reporting period fluctuates based on the number of systems that are on order  the timing of order acceptance  and the status of each system within the manufacturing cycle 
advances from customers decreased to million at july  from million at july  the backlog for products decreased to million at july   from million at july  cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the fiscal years ended july    and was million  million  and million  respectively 
cash flows from investing activities in fiscal comprised net purchases of marketable securities of million and net capital expenditures of million  offset by cash received from the sale of million of building improvements  which were leased back 
in february  the company entered into an agreement to amend the existing lease on its hayward facilities to accommodate a million planned expansion of production  research and development facilities and renovation of existing production facilities via construction lease allowances 
the lease amendment also included the leaseback of an additional million of building improvements on existing facilities sold to the lessor via the lease amendment 
the initial term of the lease expires in may  and  if not cancelled by the company  will be automatically extended for three five year renewal periods and one additional eight month renewal period 
cash flows from investing activities for fiscal primarily comprised net capital expenditures of million and net purchases of marketable securities of million  offset by proceeds from the sale and leaseback of a new administrative building for million 
the company sold the building to its existing landlord and entered into a year lease that is subject to rental adjustments every three years 
cash flows from investing activities for fiscal consisted mainly of net purchases of marketable securities of million and net capital expenditures of million 
cash flows from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal years ended july    and was million  million  and million  respectively 
cash flows from financing activities for fiscal primarily reflected receipts of million from a third party financing intermediary and proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million  offset by open market purchases of the company s stock totaling million 
cash flows from financing activities for fiscal primarily reflected proceeds from issuance of common stock of million  offset by repayments of debt and capital leases of million 
cash flows from financing activities for fiscal consisted mainly of proceeds from issuance of common stock of million and from issuance of debt of million  offset by repayments of debt and capital leases of million 
during fiscal  the company repaid its outstanding term debt 
in april  the company entered into an amendment to its existing credit agreement with abn amro bank  nv to expand its million revolving credit line expiring may  to a million line of credit expiring may  in april  the term of this credit line was further extended to november  and the covenants were revised to be substantially the same as those under the hillsboro  oregon lease agreement see note to the consolidated financial statements 
indebtedness under the revolving credit facility and term note is unsecured and bears interest at the london interbank offered rate on july  plus 
the terms of the financing facility require the company to comply with certain financial and restrictive covenants  including maintenance of certain financial ratios and minimum net worth criteria  restrictions on incurring indebtedness  and certain dividend restrictions 
these covenants are substantially the same as those under the hillsboro  oregon lease agreement 
on may   the company drew down the million term note to repay in full its senior secured notes  and in may repaid its term note in full 
no prepayment penalties or debt issuance costs were incurred 
no amounts have been drawn under the revolving credit facility 
during fiscal  the company repaid million of its senior secured indebtedness which amount includes the million referred to below  and repaid million of senior subordinated notes out of the proceeds of the ipo 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company extinguished the remaining million of its senior secured indebtedness with the proceeds of the million term loan from abn amro bank referred to above 
other factors affecting company results potential delays in shipments the company derives most of its annual revenues from the sale of a small number of systems and upgrades at prices currently ranging from approximately million to million each for mebes and alta systems  and from approximately million to million each for upgrades 
as a result  any delay in the recognition of revenue for a single system or upgrade could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations for a given accounting period 
for example  two system shipments planned for the second and third quarters of fiscal were delayed  due to the failure of a critical subassembly and to a problem in meeting a specification  and were shipped instead in the third and fourth quarters  respectively 
these delays caused the company to miss its revenue and earnings plan for the second quarter of fiscal cyclicity of the maskmaking and semiconductor industries and dependence on the capital spending decisions of customers the company s operating results depend on capital expenditures by maskmakers  which in turn depend on the current and anticipated demand for masks  integrated circuits made from masks  and products that use such integrated circuits 
the overall semiconductor industry has been  and is likely to continue to be  cyclical with periods of oversupply 
the current downturn in the demand for semiconductors may reduce the demand for masks and could reduce the demand for the company s maskmaking equipment 
the company s ability to reduce expenses in response to any such downturn is limited by its need for continued investment in research and development and in customer service and support 
previous downturns in capital investment by the maskmaking industry have materially adversely affected the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations  and future downturns may have similar material adverse effects 
in addition  due to changes in semiconductor manufacturing technology  the demand for maskmaking equipment has at times been depressed while the demand for semiconductor devices has remained strong 
a downturn in demand for maskmaking equipment would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
development of new products and enhancements the semiconductor industry in general  and the maskmaking industry in particular  are characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards 
the failure or significant delay in the development  manufacture or marketing of new products  or in the enhancement of existing products  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in selecting  developing  manufacturing and marketing new products or enhancements of existing products 
damage to manufacturing facilities the company conducts all of its manufacturing activities for its core products at its leased facilities in hayward  california and beaverton  oregon 
the company s hayward campus  which includes the corporate headquarters  is located in a seismically active area 
although the company maintains business interruption insurance  a major catastrophe such as an earthquake or other natural disaster at the hayward or beaverton sites could result in a prolonged interruption of the company s business 
all of the company s mebes electron beam systems are produced in hayward  and all of its alta laser beam systems are produced in beaverton 
neither facility is currently equipped to produce the type of system produced by the other 
competition the company has a number of competitors  including companies that have significantly greater resources  such as hitachi ltd 
while the company belives that its products benefit from a superior technical approach to mask lithography  there can be no assurance that competitors will not develop future generations of products that are superior in features  cost  or other factors to the company s product offerings at that time 
development of a clearly superior competitive product for pattern generation mask lithography would have a materially adverse impact on the company 
successful integration of acquired businesses the company s business strategy includes expanding its product lines and markets through acquisitions 
any acquisition may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  potential reductions in income due to losses incurred by the acquired business  and amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired  any of which could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in march  the company acquired ebetech electron beam technology gmbh  renamed etec ebt 
this subsidiary which is part of the display products group is engaged in the development of focused electron beam test systems for flat panel displays 
these products are currently in the preliminary development stage and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to introduce them successfully into the market 
in february  the company acquired polyscan  inc a development stage company based in tucson  arizona that designs and develops laser direct imaging systems for printed circuit board and multichip module applications 
polyscan  inc has subsequently been merged into the company s operations and has become the company s interconnect products group ipg 
ipg has recognized revenue on one system in fiscal and has incurred losses since its inception 
the company expects that ipg will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
the company has never operated in the market segments targeted by ipg 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to integrate ipg successfully into its current business operations or will be able to integrate the technology into the company s product development strategy or to manufacture  market  and sell its products successfully  or that its business will ever become profitable 
there can be no assurance of the effect of any future acquisition on the company s business or operating results 
international sales and operations sales to customers in countries other than the united states accounted for   and of revenues in fiscal   and  respectively 
the company anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of revenues for the foreseeable future 
sales and operations outside of the united states are subject to certain inherent risks  including fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies  tariffs  quotas  taxes and other market barriers  political and economic instability  restrictions on the export or import of technology  potentially limited intellectual property protection  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
there can be no assurance that any of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
in particular  although the company s international sales are primarily denominated in us dollars  currency exchange fluctuations in countries where the company does business  such as those experienced recently in certain asian countries  could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
year issue computer programs and systems that make use of dates represented by only two digits rather than may not operate properly after the year two digit fields can cause problems with sorting  mathematical calculations and comparisons when working with years outside the range of through the problem also potentially extends to any systems or devices that include embedded technology  such as microchips 
the company has established a formal project with a project office and project team to address this issue and achieve year yk readiness 
the company has chosen the us government accounting office gao program management model  as modified  to manage and measure its progress 
the project focuses on four key readiness areas product readiness  addressing product functionality  supplier readiness  addressing the preparedness of our suppliers  internal infrastructure readiness  addressing mission critical internal information technology it and non it systems  and customer readiness  addressing customer preparedness and the company s customer support 
for each readiness area  the company is systematically performing an enterprise wide risk assessment  implementing the gao program management model as a project  and developing contingency plans to mitigate unknown risk 
the company is also communicating with its customers  suppliers  employees  and other third party business partners to reinforce awareness and to inform them of its progress toward year readiness 
the company is doing this through a variety of media  including regular updates to the yk area of the corporate web site 
the awareness and assessment phases of the project have been substantially completed and the renovation phase commenced in may the company has engaged a third party to assist in its effort to ensure a comprehensive effort is made to address the yk issue 
product readiness a single test suite is used to test all of the company s products 
this provides a complete assessment of potential yk impacts and precludes inefficient use of resources that would result from the performance of individual customer test suites 
etec is performing its testing in accordance with sematech year test scenarios 
the company has communicated to its customers the current status for each of its products  as well as a proposed remediation plan and schedule 
customer readiness the company plans to commence making year compliant updates to its customers systems through its standard service update plan process by january  with completion planned by june a monitoring phase of the program is planned as well  which provides for the contingency of customers experiencing issues with the validation and implementation phases of the project 
supplier readiness this aspect of the program is focused on minimizing risk associated with the company s suppliers in two areas first  the supplier s capability to provide yk compliant products and second  the supplier s business capability to continue to provide the required products and services 
the company is using the sematech year readiness supplier questionnaire as an aid in assessing risk 
a supplier action list and contingency plans are being developed based upon this assessment 
supplier issues that potentially affect the company s products are targeted to be resolved by december internal infrastructure readiness the company has completed an assessment of its it and non it applications and its business processes 
some applications and processes have already been made yk compliant  while others are being prioritized and assigned resources based upon their importance to the company s ability to conduct business 
all implementations are scheduled to be completed no later than july the company estimates that the total year costs will range from to million  with the majority of these costs to be incurred over the next six fiscal quarters 
the company is continuing its assessment and developing alternatives that will result in a further refinement of this estimate over time 
there can be no assurance that actual costs will not differ materially from the current estimate 
if computer systems used by the company or its suppliers  or the software applications used in systems manufactured and sold by the company  fail or experience significant difficulties  the company s results of operations could be materially affected 
forward looking statements statements in this report that are prefaced with words such as expects  anticipates  believes  or similar words and other statements of similar sense are forward looking statements 
these statements are based on the company s current expectations and estimates as to prospective events and circumstances that may or may not be within the company s control and as to which there can be no firm assurances given 
these forward looking statements  like any other forward looking statements  involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated 
effects of recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 reporting comprehensive income sfas 
sfas establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and requires the company to report additional information on comprehensive income to supplement the reporting of income 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  comparative financial statements must be provided for all periods presented and require reclassification adjustments 
the company will adopt sfas in the first quarter of fiscal in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas 
sfas establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments in annual and interim financial statements and also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas  and major customers 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company will adopt sfas in the first quarter of fiscal in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas establishes new standards of accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas requires that all derivatives be recognized at their fair value in the statement of financial position and the corresponding gains or losses be either reported in the statement of operations or as a component of comprehensive income  depending on the type of hedging relationship that exists 
the company will adopt sfas in fiscal and does not expect its provisions to have a material effect on the company s presentation of its consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
as of july   the company s cash and investment portfolio includes fixed income securities 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
due to the short duration of the company s investment portfolio  an immediate increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of the company s portfolio 
the company has the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore the company would not expect its operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on its securities portfolio 
foreign currency exchange risk 
the majority of the company s sales are denominated in us dollars and as a result  the company has relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
however  the company enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge certain intercompany exposures denominated in foreign currencies 
these forward exchange contracts are denominated in the same currency as the underlying transaction 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the effect of an immediate change in exchange rates on the forward contracts would not have a material impact on the company s future operating results or cash flows
