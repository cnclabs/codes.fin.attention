item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks  which include changes in us interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rate as measured against the us dollar 
interest rate risk the interest payable for the company s revolving credit agreement is principally between and basis points above the federal funds rate and therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
however  the company has the option to pay the balance in full at any time without penalty 
as a result  the company believes that the market risk is minimal 
foreign currency risk the company has a sales office located in canada 
sales are typically denominated in canadian dollars  thereby creating exposures to changes in exchange rates 
the changes in the canadian us exchange rate may positively or negatively affect the company s sales  gross margins  and retained earnings 
the company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk through working capital management 
there can be no assurance that such an approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of the canadian dollar 
the company does not hedge against foreign currency risk
