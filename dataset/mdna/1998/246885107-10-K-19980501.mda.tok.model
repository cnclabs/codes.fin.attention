overview the company is a leading direct marketer of casual apparel and related accessories to girls and young women 
through its recently acquired tsi subsidiary  the company also sells a broad range of soccer related merchandise and apparel to young men and women through catalogs and retail stores 
the company acquired tsi on december  tsi carries on a business conducted by predecessor entities since pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated december   a wholly owned subsidiary of the company was merged with and into tsi 
as a result of the tsi merger  tsi became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
in connection with the tsi merger  the company issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock to certain stockholders of tsi  including  shares of common stock to employees of tsi pursuant to a change of control provision in tsi s stock appreciation rights plan 
the company also made cash payments of approximately  to former stockholders of tsi who exercised statutory dissenters rights 
the tsi merger was structured as a tax free exchange and the company has accounted for the tsi merger as a pooling of interests 
on december   the company acquired gurl  interactive inc  the owner of the www 
gurl 
com web site 
the acquisition was accounted for by the purchase method 
the consideration paid by the company was not material 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded merger related costs of million in connection with expenses related to the tsi merger including professional fees  costs related to consolidation of distribution facilities  including a provision for lease termination and the write off of property and equipment  and cancellation of contracts 
direct marketing businesses 
the company initially mailed delia s catalogs to persons responding to advertisements and to names on rented lists 
tsi soccer distributes catalogs to persons who have requested catalogs and to participants at soccer tournaments  soccer league members and names it acquires from purchased or rented lists 
the company has built a proprietary list of house names customers who have made at least one purchase or have requested a catalog from the company in the preceding months  which contained approximately million names as of january   primarily through referrals  word of mouth  returns of catalog request cards and targeted classified advertising in selected magazines 
a significant portion of the company s catalogs are mailed to house names including prior purchases  supplemented by purchased and rented lists 
the response rates generated from the company s list of buyers are typically higher than those the company realizes from purchased or rented lists 
the company plans to increase the number of catalogs it distributes from million in fiscal to in excess of million in fiscal the company distributed six editions of its delia s catalog in fiscal  eight editions in fiscal and anticipates distributing nine editions in fiscal the company distributed five editions of its tsi soccer catalog in fiscal and fiscal and anticipates distributing six editions in fiscal as the company continues to increase its prospecting efforts and the number of catalogs it distributes  the company intends to continue to increase its aggregate marketing expenditures  which the company expects will result in a decrease in operating margin 
with increased catalog distribution  the company has observed a decline in response rates and expects that response rates will decline further in the future 
response rates have typically fluctuated on a year to year and catalog to catalog basis 
response rates are influenced by a number of factors including the timing of catalog mailings  market acceptance of the company s merchandise and the mix and presentation of products and actions of competitors 
average order size has also fluctuated seasonally 
generally  the average size of orders from the company s fall and winter catalogs is larger than the average size of orders from its spring and summer catalogs 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company began mailing catalogs to selected portions of its house list  including its first sale circular and its first targeted supplemental catalog 
in part to facilitate its targeted publishing strategy  the company has developed its in house art department to allow for shorter and more flexible publishing schedules 
in addition  certain of the company s vendors have agreed to purchase raw materials in advance and in excess of the company s initial purchase orders 
this allows the company to place orders later in a season in response to early indicators of customer demand while reducing the company s inventory risk 
although the company sometimes shares the risk of these raw material orders with such vendors  these advance purchases limit its exposure to the greater risk of unsold finished goods 
the company believes these actions helped to improve its overall profitability in fiscal retail businesses 
tsi opened its first two retail stores in  opened eight stores in and three in the company may seek to grow its soccer specialty retail business through new store openings or through acquisition 
the company opened its first delia s retail outlet store in reading  pennsylvania in november the opening of this store did not have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations in fiscal the company recently entered into leases for two additional retail outlet stores in new york state and plans to open additional retail outlet stores in the company believes that these outlet stores will modestly increase net sales and allow the company to liquidate unsold inventory at a greater margin than is usually available through other liquidation means 
the company will also consider opening full priced delia s stores or premium outlets on a test basis 
capital investments 
in order to support its direct marketing operations  the company has made and continues to make significant capital expenditures for telephone and management information systems and has hired and maintained an in house workforce of teleservice representatives 
the company also made significant capital expenditures in connection with the relocation of its warehouse and fulfillment operations from a third party contractor s facility to its own leased facility in hanover  pennsylvania in the second quarter of fiscal the company expects to make additional significant capital expenditures to build infrastructure including high performance sophisticated retail management systems to support the additional sales volume the facility is expected to handle as a result of the relocation of tsi s fulfillment operations  the expected growth in the delia s catalog and the expansion of delia s retail businesses 
certain risks 
as the company s revenue base grows and it further penetrates its target market  the company will not be able to sustain the levels of percentage annual growth in net sales and growth in operating income experienced in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal in addition  as the company continues to increase the number of catalogs it mails  it has observed that new customers respond at lower rates than the company s existing customers have historically responded 
this trend in response rates has begun to have and is likely to continue to have a material adverse effect on the company s rate of sales growth and on the company s profitability 
in addition  the company has observed that when customers receive multiple editions of catalogs within the same fiscal quarter to customers who had received a prior edition of those catalogs earlier in such quarter  the company s aggregate response rates have declined 
as the company increases its mailing of multiple editions of catalogs to a broader market  it expects that response rates will decline further 
this trend in response rates has begun to have and is likely to continue to have a material adverse effect on the company s profitability 
additionally  legislation introduced in the us congress that proposes restrictions on persons  principally list brokers  that sell  purchase or otherwise use for commercial purposes personal information about teens under the age of and children could adversely affect the company s use of purchased and rented lists  as well as the company s ability to generate new names for its proprietary database 
although the company is not a list broker  it does mail catalogs to persons whose names are derived from purchased and rented lists 
approximately of the names of persons to whom the company mailed its fiscal catalogs were derived from purchased and rented lists  and the company anticipates continuing its use of such lists 
the company s use of purchased and rented lists fluctuates from season to season and from year to year 
the company is exploring new methods for developing its house list and believes it will be able to continue to develop this list through advertising and new channels for the distribution of its catalogs  including the company s www 
delias 
com web site 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to develop its house list 
the company recognizes that its operations may be negatively affected by year software issues 
the company is heavily dependent upon complex computer software and systems for all phases of its operations 
many existing computer programs and systems use only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
these programs and systems were designed and developed without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century 
if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results by or at the year accordingly  the company has prepared a year compliance program which involves i identifying the material operating software and systems on which the company depends whether used by the company or by the company s service providers  ii obtaining written assurances from third party software and systems vendors and service providers  iii monitoring the compliance efforts of such vendors and service providers and iv testing  to the extent practicable  its material operating software and systems 
all of the company s material operating software and systems were developed by and are supported by third party vendors 
each of the third party vendors of the company s mission critical computer software have provided written assurances to the company that such software will not be affected by the change in the century 
the majority of the third party vendors of the company s other material operating software and systems have also provided such assurances or assurances that such software and systems will be compliant by december  the company expects to begin performing tests of all its material operating software and systems to verify the assurances given by these third party vendors and ensure year compliance later in fiscal in addition to the operating systems and software the company uses directly  the company s operations are also dependent upon the performance of operating software and systems used by its significant service providers  including providers of financial  telecommunications and parcel delivery services 
the company has contacted or is contacting each of its significant service providers to obtain written assurances from such providers that the providers relevant operating software and systems are in year compliance or will be by december  the company will monitor the status of all its significant service providers year compliance efforts to minimize the risk of any material adverse effect on the company s operations resulting from compliance failures 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s service providers have  or will have  operating software and systems that are in year compliance 
therefore  the company is developing contingency plans with respect to its significant service providers 
in addition  most purchases of merchandise from the company are made with credit cards  and the company s operations may be materially adversely affected to the extent its customers are unable to use their credit cards due to year issues that are not rectified by the customers credit card vendors 
the company presently believes that the cost of its year program will not have a material adverse effect on the company  however  given the company s dependence on third party software and system vendors and service providers and on its customers vendors  there can be no assurance to that effect

on december   the company sold  shares of common stock in the ipo 
the company received net proceeds of million 
on june   the company sold  shares of common stock in a second underwritten public offering the offering

the company has invested substantially all of the proceeds of both offerings in interest bearing  investment grade securities 
a portion of the proceeds of the offering has been used for working capital and the tsi merger

pro forma net income for the year ended january  represents actual reported net income 
see note of notes to financial statements 
comparison of fiscal years and net sales 
net sales increased approximately million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in net sales was primarily due to an increase in the number of delia s catalogs mailed  as well as an increase in average order size and  to a lesser degree  the opening of three new tsi soccer retail stores 
aggregate response rates from catalogs mailed in fiscal declined relative to catalogs distributed in fiscal as the company mailed multiple editions during each quarter of fiscal to a large number of persons who had received a prior edition of those catalogs earlier in such quarter 
the company believes response rates will usually decline when it mails additional catalog editions within the same fiscal period and as it mails to a broader ranger of customers 
the increase in average order size resulted from a combination of factors  including increased prices on certain existing items and the addition of certain more expensive items in the company s catalogs 
gross margin 
gross margin increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in gross margin was primarily due to a larger proportion of higher margin apparel sales from the delia s catalog compared to relatively lower margin soccer merchandise sales from the tsi soccer catalog and retail stores 
to a lesser degree  gross margin increased because of i improved sourcing of merchandise  including larger volume discounts from suppliers and a greater proportion of private label products sourced directly from overseas contract manufacturers  ii changes in product mix and iii higher selling prices 
these improvements were partially offset by an increased reserve for returns consistent with the company s recent growth and an increased inventory reserve for obsolescence based upon management s evaluation of merchandise inventories as of january  and anticipated inventory dispositions 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net sales from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to greater marketing expenditures on catalog circulation and greater spending on infrastructure  which were partly offset by the leveraging of certain fixed costs over a larger revenue base 
in addition  the tsi business recorded certain expenses in fiscal associated with the relocation of its corporate and fulfillment facilities in the first six months of fiscal prior to the tsi merger 
merger related costs 
merger related costs of million were incurred in fiscal connection with the tsi merger and included professional fees  costs related to consolidation of distribution facilities  including a provision for lease termination and the write off of property and equipment  and cancellation of contracts 
interest income  net 
interest income  net  increased approximately million  from  in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in interest income  net  was primarily due to the company s investment of the net proceeds from the ipo and the offering 
following the consummation of the tsi merger  the company repaid substantially all of tsi s outstanding long term debt and bank line of credit 
provision benefit for income taxes 
provision benefit for income taxes increased approximately million from a benefit of  in fiscal to a provision of million in fiscal this increase was due to the effect of the reorganization  which was effected in the fourth quarter of fiscal  in which the company converted from a limited liability company to a c corporation 
see note of notes to financial statements 
comparison of fiscal years and net sales 
net sales increased approximately million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in net sales was primarily due to an increase in the number of catalogs mailed  as well as an increase in response rates and average order size and the opening of eight tsi soccer retail stores 
the company increased the number of catalogs it distributed from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in average order size resulted from a combination of factors  including increased prices on certain existing items and the addition of certain more expensive items in the company s delia s catalog 
gross margin 
gross margin increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in gross margin was primarily due to a larger proportion of higher margin apparel sales from the delia s catalog compared to relatively lower margin soccer merchandise sales from the tsi soccer catalog and retail stores 
to a lesser degree  gross margin increased because of certain related fixed costs of merchandising were spread over increased sales and improved sourcing of merchandise  including larger volume discounts from suppliers  as well as changes in product mix and higher selling prices 
these improvements were partially offset by an increased inventory reserve for obsolescence based upon management s evaluation of merchandise inventories as of january  and anticipated inventory dispositions as well as an increased reserve for returns consistent with the company s recent growth 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales from in fiscal to in fiscal the reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to economies implemented in catalog production as well as the leveraging of certain fixed costs over a larger revenue base 
the reduction was partially offset by a charge of approximately  in fiscal related to the processing of names of catalog requesters through a third party service  as well as the company s higher expenditures of corporate salaries and additional information systems in anticipation of sales growth 
interest income expense  net 
interest income expense  net  increased approximately  from  in expense in fiscal to  in income in fiscal the increase in interest income  net  was primarily due to the company s investment of the net proceeds from the ipo  which proceeds were received in the fourth quarter of fiscal provision benefit for income taxes 
benefit for income taxes increased approximately  from a benefit of  in fiscal to a benefit of  in fiscal this decrease was almost entirely due to the reorganization  which was effected in the fourth quarter of fiscal  in which the company converted from a limited liability company to a c corporation

the company is subject to seasonal fluctuations in its merchandise sales and results of operations 
the company expects its net sales and results of operations generally to be lower in the second quarter and higher in the fourth quarter which includes the holiday season of each fiscal year 
the company s quarterly results may fluctuate as a result of numerous factors  including the timing  quantity and cost of catalog mailings  the timing of sale circulars and liquidations  the timing of merchandise deliveries  market acceptance of the company s merchandise including new merchandise categories or products introduced  the mix of products sold  the hiring and training of additional personnel  the timing of inventory writedowns  the incurrence of other operating costs and factors beyond the company s control  such as general economic conditions and actions of competitors 
accordingly  the results of operations in any quarter will not necessarily be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year or any future quarter 
see item business risk factors seasonal and quarterly fluctuations 
in fiscal  the company has adjusted its mailing schedule to more closely mirror what the company believes to be the emerging catalog purchasing trends of its delia s catalog customers 
accordingly  the company has increased the number of catalogs it plans to mail in the first and fourth quarters relative to the number of catalogs it plans to mail in the second and third quarters 
in addition  the company also intends to mail additional tsi soccer catalogs in the second quarter of fiscal in connection with the quadrennial world cup soccer competition 
liquidity and capital resources without giving effect to the tsi merger  since its inception  the company has met its operating and cash requirements through funds generated from operations  the private sales of equity securities and the offering 
tsi s operating and cash requirements were provided primarily by bank loans  loans from stockholders and private equity financing 
following the consummation of the tsi merger  the company repaid substantially all of tsi s outstanding long term debt and bank line of credit 
the company expects that this will have a slight positive effect on interest income  net  in fiscal giving effect to the tsi merger in the manner described in note to the financial statements  cash provided by operations in fiscal was million  million in fiscal and  in fiscal this trend was primarily due to the growth of the company s business and the increase in net income over these periods 
cash used in investing in fiscal was million  million in fiscal and  in fiscal  as the company used the net proceeds of the ipo and the offering to invest in interest bearing  investment grade securities 
the company made capital expenditures of  in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the company currently expects to make capital expenditures in excess of million to upgrade its management information systems in fiscal the company also currently anticipates capital expenditures of at least million in fiscal for other property  plant and equipment  including leasehold improvements  office equipment and expenditures relating to the company s new warehouse and distribution operations 
cash flows from financing activities in fiscal were million as a result of the offering and private equity financing for tsi prior to the tsi merger  and million in fiscal as a result of the ipo 
cash and cash equivalents decreased by approximately million to million at january  from million at january   as the company received in net proceeds from the offering  offset by the company s shift of a portion of its investments to securities with maturities of greater than days and increased its inventory position during the fiscal year 
these securities consist primarily of aa and aaa rated municipal obligations with a maximum maturity of three years 
during the fiscal year prior to the ipo  the company operated as a limited liability company with taxes paid by its members 
following the reorganization in which the company s business was transferred to a delaware corporation  the company ceased to be a flow through entity and is now liable for applicable income taxes

the line expires on july  the company has not drawn on this line 
the company believes that its cash on hand  together with cash generated by operations and the net proceeds of the ipo and the offerings  will be sufficient to meet its capital and operating requirements through fiscal  subject to the use of cash to make acquisitions and other investments 
the company s future capital requirements  however  depend on numerous factors  including  without limitation  the success of its marketing  sales and distribution efforts 
there can be no assurance that additional funds  if required  will be available to the company on favorable terms or at all 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material adverse effect on net sales or results of operations 
the company has generally been able to pass on increased costs related to inflation through increases in its prices to customers
