item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations operating income increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal and  in fiscal  increases of and in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in operating income in fiscal was attributable to earnings from contractors heating supply chs  which the company acquired in september fiscal operating income at businesses owned by the company before was equal to or less than fiscal operating income  as unusually moderate and wet weather conditions during the spring and early summer of reduced demand for air conditioning products in the company s key markets 
in fiscal  the company generally succeeded in eliminating the operating losses at operations that were started in fiscal the increase in operating income in was attributable to a increase in sales over fiscal and a higher gross profit margin 
net income was   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
higher interest costs relating to the company s acquisitions significantly impacted net income in fiscal reductions in the company s deferred tax asset valuation allowance increased net income by  in fiscal and  in fiscal sales have increased annually  reaching million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal each of the company s subsidiaries has recorded sales increases from fiscal to fiscal  although sales at total supply in georgia declined from fiscal to fiscal due to unfavorable weather conditions and a post olympic building slowdown 
prior to fiscal  the majority of the company s sales growth had resulted from internal expansion of branch operations rather than from acquisitions  but in fiscal  of the increase in sales was attributable to operations acquired since january in comparison  acquisitions accounted for of the growth in sales from fiscal to fiscal although the increase in same store sales declined from in fiscal to in fiscal  the fiscal increase still significantly exceeded the industry average 
as expected  the greatest same store sales growth in fiscal occurred in florida  where the company completed its second year of operation 
sales of equipment manufactured by goodman manufacturing company  the company s largest supplier  and sold under the gmc and janitrol brand names  had increased from million in fiscal to a peak of million in fiscal  but declined to million in fiscal the company s gross margin percentage increased to in fiscal  from in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in gross margin percentage from fiscal to fiscal is a result of the company s efforts to focus on starting up and acquiring businesses that would enhance the company s gross margin percentage 
all of the company s operations that have been started up or acquired since attained a gross margin percentage exceeding the company average 
in particular  lifetime filter  inc lfi  which the company acquired in january  manufactures most of the products it sells and obtains a much higher gross margin percentage than the company s wholesale operations 
in addition  chs manufactures products that account for approximately of its sales revenue and  accordingly  achieves a higher gross margin percentage than if it purchased all of its inventory from outside suppliers 
because only two months of lfi s operations were included in the company s fiscal results  the positive impact on gross margin percentage of the company s manufacturing operations was significant only in fiscal in addition  as a percentage of each company s total sales  ener tech industries  which was acquired in january  and florida cooling supply  which was started up in april  sell substantially less equipment than the company s other wholesale businesses 
in the hvacr industry  the profit margin on sales of equipment  such as condensing units  furnaces and heat pumps  is generally less than on sales of parts and supplies 
as the company has grown in sales revenues  management has also negotiated more favorable pricing from its major suppliers  principally in the form of purchase volume rebates  which contributed to the increase in gross margin percentage in both fiscal and fiscal selling  general and administrative sg a costs as a percentage of sales increased to in fiscal  from in fiscal and in fiscal the increase from fiscal to fiscal was due in part to the sg a percentage at lfi and ach 
lfi s manufacturing operations are generally expected to incur a higher sg a costs as a percentage of sales than the company s distribution operations  which will generally have a higher sales volume and lower gross margin percentage 
at ach  which was acquired in april  sg a costs as a percentage of sales are higher than would ordinarily be expected because the company has staffed ach to support a greater sales volume than is presently realized  expecting to grow the company significantly in the next several years 
in fiscal  the company also recorded  more bad debt expense than in fiscal  which was largely attributable to the unexpected business failure of a single customer in the fourth quarter of fiscal  with respect to which the company wrote off  of accounts receivable 
in fiscal  the company recorded a non recurring charge of  for performance based compensation pursuant to the employment contract of its chief executive officer 
beginning in fiscal  the company earned commission revenue from a supplier by providing warehousing and shipping services to another distributor of the supplier 
in calendar  the supplier modified this arrangement to reduce the commission rate to approximately of the rate in calendar revenues from this source were  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
in calendar  the company and the supplier discontinued this arrangement  and the company does not expect to earn such commission income after fiscal net energy services income increased from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal as the company continued to provide services on a month to month basis to its remaining customer  following the expiration of its energy services contract in management does not expect to negotiate another contract with the customer  but the customer is partially dependent on the company for the proper operation of its hvacr systems 
management cannot estimate how long such an informal arrangement may continue 
interest expense increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  and in fiscal compared to as a result of the company s increased borrowings 
in  and  interest expense was  and of sales  respectively 
the increase in interest expense in fiscal was attributable to indebtedness incurred in connection with the company s acquisitions of lfi and chs 
see liquidity and capital resources  below 
other non operating income increased from fiscal to fiscal  and from fiscal to fiscal as the company has strengthened its policy to collect finance charges from customers with past due balances 
current income tax expense consists principally of state income taxes 
as a result of the company s substantial tax loss carryforwards  the company has minimal liability for federal income taxes 
see liquidity and capital resources  below 
in both fiscal and  the company determined that further reductions in its deferred tax asset valuation allowance were appropriate given expectations of higher future taxable income from recently acquired subsidiaries and  as a result  recorded additional tax benefits of  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources working capital increased from million at february  to million at february  as a result of the company s earnings and the chs acquisition 
accounts receivable represented days of gross sales at the end of fiscal  compared to days of sales in receivables at the end of fiscal of the million increase in inventory  million was located at operations acquired in fiscal in addition  the company had  of hvacr equipment inventory at heating and cooling supply at february   which replaced janitrol brand equipment held on consignment in previous fiscal years 
the company has credit facilities with a commercial bank bank which include an million revolving line of credit and a  term loan facility for the purchase of capital equipment 
at february   the company had available credit of  and  under the revolving credit line and the term loan facility  respectively 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are secured by accounts receivable and inventory  and the permitted amount of outstanding borrowings at any time is limited to of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventory amounts 
borrowings under the facility bear interest  at the company s option  at either the bank s prime rate plus or libor plus  payable monthly 
restrictive covenants of the loan agreement prohibit the company from paying dividends  prepaying any subordinated indebtedness or incurring certain other debt without the bank s consent  and also require the company to maintain certain financial ratios see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the credit line and the term loan facilities mature in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
a schedule of declining prepayment penalties applies in the event that the line of credit facility is paid prior to maturity 
net additional borrowings under the company s revolving line of credit during fiscal were for the purpose of acquiring chs 
see results of operations  above 
during fiscal  the company borrowed  in two separate transactions from the catalyst fund  ltd 
and an affiliate catalyst to acquire ach and to repay outstanding indebtedness to st 
james capital partners  lp st 
james 
such borrowings bear interest at per annum  payable monthly 
principal is to be repaid in monthly installments of  from february through january   from february through august   from september through august  and  from september through january the borrowings are subordinated to the company s indebtedness to the bank 
in connection with such borrowings  the company also granted catalyst a warrant to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at a price of per share  exercisable at any time before february  covenants of the company s loan agreement with catalyst  which also covers a prior loan by catalyst to the company and certain subsidiaries  prohibit dividends and restrict additional borrowings without catalyst s consent  and also require the company to maintain specified financial ratios see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the st 
james indebtedness that was repaid with the proceeds of the catalyst loans described above had been incurred in in connection with the purchase of lfi 
the st 
james note had an interest rate of per annum  was convertible into common stock of the company at per share and had an initial maturity date of january  at its option  the company could have extended the maturity date for one year upon issuance of a warrant for  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of 
in connection with the acquisitions of chs and ach in fiscal  the company issued notes to the sellers aggregating  which are subordinated to the bank 
such debt is payable over terms of two to three years and bears interest at per annum at february  the rate on the chs note varies with changes in the prime rate 
the company made capital expenditures of  in fiscal for leasehold improvements  computer software  equipment  and the addition and replacement of vehicles under capital leases 
the company has no material commitments for future capital expenditures 
during fiscal  the company sold land that it owned in las vegas to a buyer which is constructing an office warehouse that the company has agreed to lease for an initial term of ten years 
the buyer also assumed  of mortgage indebtedness on the land 
the company has approximately million in tax loss carryforwards and million in tax credit carryforwards 
such operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will substantially limit the company s federal income tax liabilities in the near future 
certain provisions of the internal revenue code code regulate the amount of additional stock that the company could issue without resulting in a change in ownership control  as defined in the code 
should such a change in control be deemed to occur  the company s ability to utilize its operating loss and tax credit carryforwards would be severely restricted 
the company expects that cash flows from operations and the borrowing availability under its revolving credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to meet its normal operating requirements  existing debt service and expected capital expenditures 
subject to limitations set forth in its loan agreement with the bank  funds available under the company s revolving credit facility may also be utilized to finance acquisitions 
the company is actively considering additional financing alternatives in order to continue its plan of acquiring other hvacr distribution companies 
such financing may be in the form of subordinated debt  equity or some combination of debt and equity 
although management has engaged in discussions with several potential lenders or investors  the company has no commitment for additional financing and cannot predict whether or when any such additional financing may materialize 
management is also reviewing the suitability of several acquisition opportunities  but has not entered into letters of intent to acquire any companies 
the company s ability to consummate a significant acquisition would be dependent upon obtaining additional financing 
seasonality the company s sales volume and  accordingly  its operating income vary significantly during its fiscal year 
the highest levels of sales occur during the times of the year when climatic conditions require the greatest use of air conditioning  since the company s operations are concentrated in the warmer regions of the united states 
accordingly  sales will be highest in the company s second quarter ending august  and will be lowest in its fourth fiscal quarter 
the acquisition of chs  which is based in denver  slightly affected the company s previous seasonality  as chs generally experiences its highest level of sales in the third quarter of the company s fiscal year 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its results of operations in recent years 
generally  manufacturer price increases attributable to inflation uniformly affect both the company and its competitors  and such increases are passed through to customers as an increase in sales prices 
year issue the company has evaluated the exposure of its computer software and systems to the problem commonly known as the year issue 
although the company s software applications already generally accommodate dates in the year  the company will acquire in fiscal an upgrade  available under its existing licensing agreement  to its existing integrated computer software application that is fully year compliant 
one of the company s subsidiaries does not utilize the company s integrated software and is presently involved in modifying its computer programs to accommodate year the company believes that it will be fully year compliant by the end of fiscal and does not expect that its costs to achieve compliance will be material to its operations
