item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview memberworks addresses the needs of organizations seeking to leverage the expertise of an outside provider in offering membership service programs 
membership service programs offer selected products and services from a variety of vendors intended to enhance the existing relationships between businesses and consumers 
the company derives its revenues principally from annually renewable membership fees 
the company generally receives full payment of annual fees at or near the beginning of the membership period  but recognizes revenue ratably over the membership period 
similarly  the costs associated with soliciting each new member  as well as the cost of royalties  printing and mailing of membership materials are amortized ratably over the same period 
profitability and cash flow generated from renewal memberships exceed that of new memberships due to the absence of solicitation costs associated with new member procurement 
on september   the company issued a press release that stated it had contacted the securities and exchange commission sec to determine whether the sec staff s view regarding the timing of revenue recognition for companies such as memberworks incorporated that sell services has changed in the wake of cendant corporation s agreement announced on august  with the sec to modify its revenue recognition practices 
the company had requested the sec staff to comment on and has provided the sec staff with information demonstrating the continued appropriateness of its revenue recognition practices 
the company has consistently followed these practices in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices and with the concurrence of pricewaterhousecoopers llp  its independent accountants 
as a result of this review and several discussions with the sec staff  the staff has not objected to the company s decision to presently continue to follow its revenue recognition practices  as described above 
the sec staff did request the company to change its method of accounting for printing and mailing of membership materials  beginning as of july  the company will record the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle in the first quarter of fiscal see footnote on page f for a description of the change and its financial impact 
on september   the sec issued a press release and stated the sec will formulate and augment new and existing accounting rules and interpretations covering revenue recognition  restructuring reserves  materiality  and disclosure  for all publicly traded companies 
until such time as the sec staff issues such interpretative guidelines  it is unclear what  if any  impact such interpretative guidance will have on the company s current accounting practices 
however  the potential changes in accounting practice being considered by the sec staff could have a material impact on the manner in which the company recognizes revenue 
any such changes would have no effect on reported cash flow or the economic value of the company s memberships

because the company uses multiple vendors to process its billing transactions  its external risk is mitigated as vendors may be used interchangeably

the company has incurred significant operating losses since its inception 
although the company has experienced revenue growth and has reported net income in recent periods  such growth rates may not be sustainable and are not indicative of future operating results 
there can be no assurance that the company will maintain profitability in the future
