item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of grey wolf  inc grey wolf or the company included elsewhere herein 
all significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated 
general the company s operations have been and will continue to be significantly affected by the new management team installed in  the implementation of a new business strategy in april and the major transactions that have been consummated by the company since august since the implementation of its new business strategy  the company has acquired drilling rigs and now has the largest or second largest active rig fleet in each of its four core domestic markets  the ark la tex  mississippi alabama  south texas and gulf coast markets 
as of march  the company s rig fleet consists of rigs  of which are currently marketed by the company 
refurbishment and reactivation of the company s inventory rigs is also a key element of the company s business strategy 
from the fourth quarter of through february  the company has refurbished rigs at an approximate total cost of million 
of the company s inventory of rigs  at march   three rigs are undergoing refurbishment and the company intends to begin refurbishment of the remaining during and the company estimates total costs for pending and planned refurbishments will total approximately million  of which million had been expended at december  by increasing the size of its rig fleet through acquisitions and refurbishments  the company has increased its market share in its four core domestic markets during a period of rapidly rising demand and day rates for land drilling rigs in those key markets 
the combined effect of the company s larger fleet of marketable rigs  higher rig utilization rates and increasing day rates has significantly improved the company s financial performance since the third quarter of despite increased drilling operating costs  including wages and benefits  and debt service over the same period 
although the company generated million in net income during  prior to that the company had not had a profitable full year since financial condition and liquidity the significant changes in the company s financial position from december  to december  are primarily due to the justiss and flournoy acquisitions  the kaiser francis rig purchase  the gwdc acquisition  the issuance of the senior notes and a common stock offering 
the following table summarizes the company s financial position at december  and december  december  amount amount working capital   property and equipment  net   other noncurrent assets   total   long term debt   other long term liabilities   shareholders equity   total   the million increase in net property and equipment  is a direct result of the company s acquisition and refurbishment programs 
during  the company acquired additional drilling rigs and refurbished from inventory 
these increases in property and equipment due to acquisitions and refurbishments were partially offset by the sale of indrillers and additional depreciation 
in connection with certain of these transactions  the company recorded approximately million in deferred taxes due to the difference between the purchase price and the tax basis of the assets acquired 
these acquisitions also accounted for approximately million of the million increase in shareholders equity as million shares were issued in the flournoy acquisition and million shares were issued in the gwdc acquisition 
the remaining increase in shareholders equity is due to net income of million and the closing in november of a common stock offering 
on november   the company closed an offering of million shares of its common stock 
the company sold million newly issued common shares and certain shareholders sold million shares at per share 
the company received proceeds  net of underwriting discount  of approximately million 
working capital also increased by million from december  to december  this is primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents of million 
this increase was primarily a result of million provided by financing activities and million provided by operating activities partially offset by million used in investing activities 
operating activities during the year ended december   million was provided by operating activities 
this was a result of million in cash generated from operations offset by changes in working capital items of million 
cash used for working capital items consisted primarily of an increase in accounts receivable of million partially offset by an increase in accounts payable 
the increased working capital requirements were a result of certain of the acquisitions completed by the company 
acquisitions of drilling rigs and certain other related equipment require additional working capital to operate 
investing activities during  the company invested million in property and equipment  net of asset sales 
the cash portion of the purchase price for the gwdc acquisition  including transaction costs  accounted for million and the cash acquisition of justiss  the kaiser francis rigs and the other rig purchase accounted for million 
in addition  during the company spent million on rig refurbishments and million on drill pipe and other drilling related equipment 
in addition  the acquisitions of flournoy and gwdc resulted in million and million  respectively  in non cash additions to property and equipment 
financing activities during  the company obtained a net million from financing activities  consisting principally of net proceeds of million from the issuance of senior notes  net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million and borrowings and repayments under the bank credit facility 
these borrowings were used to fund the cash portion of the gwdc acquisition and the justiss  kaiser francis and other rig purchases  as well as to fund working capital requirements and capital expenditures discussed above 
the company had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  recent acquisition on january   the company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of murco drilling corporation murco for million in cash 
the company funded this stock purchase out of working capital and million in borrowings under its bank credit facility 
future activities the company anticipates substantial funding requirements with its rig refurbishment program during the company currently has three rigs under refurbishment and will begin refurbishment of the remaining as demand warrants 
the company estimates total costs for pending and planned refurbishment will total approximately million 
these estimates are based on deployment of all rigs to the company s four core domestic markets at an estimated average refurbishment cost of million per rig  including the cost of a new drill string 
if the company instead chooses to refurbish rigs for service in the venezuelan or other international markets  it is estimated that the average refurbishment cost of such rigs will be million per rig  including the cost of a new drill string 
overall estimated capital expenditures for rig refurbishments would be correspondingly increased by the incremental refurbishment cost of rigs destined for international markets 
the company believes that the cash flow from operations  and to the extent required  further borrowings under the bank credit facility or other external debt financing  will be sufficient to fund the company s refurbishment program and meet its other anticipated capital expenditures for the company continues to actively review possible acquisition opportunities 
while the company has no agreements to acquire additional businesses or equipment other than the murco acquisition completed in  suitable opportunities may arise in the future 
the timing or success of any acquisition effort and the size of the associated potential capital commitments cannot be predicted at this time 
the ability of the company to consummate any such transaction will be dependent in large part on its ability to fund such transactions 
there can be no assurance that adequate funding will be available on terms satisfactory to the company

revenues generated in venezuela increased slightly to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was due to increases in day rates received because the number of rig days worked decreased by days caused by the non renewal of several drilling contracts for which the company was unable to obtain replacement contracts from the same or other customers

other income  net increased million to million in from million in primarily as a result of a million gain recorded in connection with the sale of its western division in the second quarter of inflation and changing prices contract drilling revenues do not necessarily track the changes in general inflation as they tend to respond to the level of activity on the part of the oil and gas industry in combination with the supply of equipment and the number of competing companies 
capital and operating costs are influenced to a larger extent by specific price changes in the oil and gas industry and to a lesser extent by changes in general inflation 
foreign exchange venezuelan operations are often performed by the company pursuant to drilling contracts under which payments to the company are denominated in united states dollars but are payable in venezuelan currency at a floating exchange rate 
although the company s venezuelan contracts usually allow the company to exchange up to of payments made to it in venezuelan currency for united states dollars for a limited period of time following the payment and at the official venezuelan exchange rate in effect at the time the payment was made to the company thus offering limited protection against adverse fluctuation  the company is typically subject to the risk of adverse currency fluctuations with respect to the balance of such payments 
additionally  a significant portion of costs and expenses relating to the company s international operations are comprised of goods and services procured in the respective foreign countries and paid for in the respective countries currencies 
accordingly  management expects that the company s subsidiaries operating in venezuela will be required to maintain significant cash balances in venezuelan currency 
the company is not a party to any currency hedging arrangements and has not during the three year period ending december  entered into any currency hedges to protect it from foreign currency losses 
instead  the company attempts to manage assets in foreign countries to minimize its exposure to currency fluctuations 
despite those efforts  however  the company remains subject to the risk of foreign currency losses 
during the year ended december   the company realized currency gains of  and  in and   and  respectively  were recorded as decreases in shareholders equity due to a devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar
