item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain statements in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to the statements in the first paragraph of overview regarding future revenues  second paragraph of overview regarding the impact on the company of a loss of a major oem customer  the statements in the analysis of years ended march  and under cost of sales regarding anticipated product introductions  related cost improvements and trends offsetting such cost improvements  the statements in the second paragraph of liquidity and capital resources concerning renewal of the revolving line of credit to this the statements in the last paragraph under liquidity and capital resources regarding the anticipated spending for capital additions in fiscal and the sufficiency of the company s available resources to meet working capital and capital expenditure requirements  and the statements in factors affecting future operating results 
the forward looking statements contained herein are based on current expectations and entail various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these expressed in such forward looking statements 
overview the company designs  manufactures and markets highly linear single carrier and multicarrier power amplifiers that support a broad range of worldwide analog and digital wireless transmissions standards  including amps  tdma  cdma  tacs and gsm 
the company  founded in to perform design and engineering services  first entered the commercial amplifier market in and shipped its first cellular power amplifiers in the company s revenues are now derived primarily from sales to a limited number of oems in the wireless infrastructure equipment market  in particular northern telecom 
the company pursues a strategy of vertical integration in its design and manufacturing processes  including operating its own inch wafer fabrication facility 
as a result  the company has a higher level of fixed costs and is dependent upon substantial revenue to achieve profitability 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  first quarter of fiscal and third quarter of fiscal  product orders fell sharply resulting in substantial losses in those quarters 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience such fluctuations in the future 
for example  the significant reduction in product revenue the company experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal reflects the impact of fluctuations in demand with a cost structure that is relatively fixed in the short term from the softening demand in the tdma markets and delays in build out of the korean pcs systems due to the unstable asian financial markets and general economic conditions in korea and other asian countries 
the company also anticipates lower product revenues over the next two to three quarters as a result of such factors and anticipates that revenues for fiscal may not equal  and will not exceed  revenues for fiscal during fiscal  northern telecom  nortel matra and lgic accounted for approximately  and of revenues  respectively 
during fiscal  northern telecom and nortel matra accounted for approximately and of revenues  respectively 
during fiscal  northern telecom and nortel matra accounted for approximately and of revenues  respectively 
the company s business  financial condition and results of operations have been materially adversely affected in the past by anticipated orders failing to materialize and by deferrals or cancellations of orders as a result of changes in oem requirements 
if the company were to lose northern telecom or any other major oem customer  or if orders by northern telecom or any other major oem customer were to otherwise materially decrease either in unit quantity or in price  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the recent financial market turmoil and economic downturn in korea may have a material adverse effect on the company s sales of its products to lgic  an oem based in korea  because a majority of the company s products ordered by lgic to date relate to the build out of the korean pcs system 
in addition  because the company s products are priced in us dollars  the currency instability in the korean and other asian financial markets may have the effect of making the company s products more expensive to lgic than those of other manufacturers whose products are priced in one of the affected asian currencies  and  therefore  lgic may reduce future purchases of the company s products 
the company s vertical integration strategy entails a number of risks  including a high level of fixed and variable costs  the management of complex processes  dependence on a single source of supply and a strict regulatory environment 
during periods of low demand  high fixed wafer fabrication costs are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
in addition  the company s strategy of frequently introducing and rapidly expanding the manufacture of new products to meet evolving oem customer and wireless service provider needs has caused the company to experience high materials and manufacturing costs  including high scrap and material waste  significant material obsolescence  labor inefficiencies  high overtime hours  inefficient material procurement and an inability to realize economies of scale 
the market for the company s products is becoming increasingly competitive 
the company has recently begun selling its power amplifier products in south korea  as well as directly to cellular service providers where its competitors are already established as suppliers 
in addition  the company competes with at least one amplifier manufacturer for business from northern telecom 
this competition has resulted in  and will continue to result in reduced average selling prices for the company s products  which accordingly will negatively impact gross margins 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain statement of operations data of the company expressed as a percentage of total revenues and the gross margin on sales 
fiscal year ended march  revenues costs and expenses cost of sales research and development selling  general and administrative total costs and expenses operating income loss interest income expense  net other income  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense net income loss gross margin on sales years ended march  and revenues 
the company s revenues increased by to million for the fiscal year ending march  fiscal from million for the fiscal year ending march  fiscal 
the sizable increase in revenues for fiscal reflects a significant increase in demand in the first three fiscal quarters of  primarily by northern telecom  for the company s second generation gsm and multicarrier products  single carrier tdma products and korean pcs cdma products 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company s revenues decreased substantially to million from million in the immediately preceding quarter due to reduced orders from oem customers stemming in part from the impact of the financial market and economic turmoil in parts of asia  particularly korea 
the company believes that it is unlikely that demand for the company s products will return to prior levels in calendar  if ever 
as a result of this factor and others as well as the difficulties in predicting the company s future revenue  the company believes that the revenues in fiscal may not meet  and will not exceed  fiscal revenues 
cost of sales 
cost of sales consists primarily of raw materials  rf semiconductor fabrication costs  amplifier assembly and test costs including turnkey assembly services  overhead and warranty costs 
the company s cost of sales increased by to million for fiscal from million for fiscal included in the cost of sales were costs associated with the rapid increase in manufacturing volume for new products and costs associated with discontinuing older products 
gross margin on sales was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the decline in gross margin for fiscal primarily reflects costs associated with steep new product volume manufacturing growth including investment in overhead infrastructure and automated test equipment  premium costs associated with materials procurement and logistics  excess and obsolete inventories and product warranty costs 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company had negative gross margin of as compared to positive gross margins of and in the third quarter of fiscal and the fourth quarter of fiscal  respectively 
the decline in the gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal was attributable to increased material  warranty  excess and obsolete inventory costs that were not reduced proportionately to revenues 
the company anticipates that the use of turnkey contractors to assemble certain high volume printed circuit board components may reduce the growth of manufacturing costs in future periods 
research and development 
research and development r d expenses include the cost of designing  developing or reducing the manufacturing cost of amplifiers and rf semiconductors 
the company s r d expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal r d spending in fiscal included development costs for the company s inch wafer fabrication facility 
the increase in r d spending in fiscal reflects increased spending in both amplifier and semiconductor r d for personnel expenses and project development expenses 
r d expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal  reflecting the substantially higher revenue levels in fiscal selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include compensation and benefits for sales  marketing  senior management and administrative personnel  commissions paid to independent sales representatives  professional fees and other expenses 
the company s sg a expenses increased by to million for fiscal from million for fiscal sg a expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in sg a expenses was primarily due to outside commissions paid for south korean sales  mis investment in new infrastructure  increases in sales and administrative headcount  and to a lesser extent the maintenance of a south korean sales support office 
the decrease of sg a expenses as a percentage of sales was a result of the substantially higher revenue level in that period 
interest income expense  net 
interest income  net for fiscal was million compared to net interest expense of  for fiscal the increase in net interest income was the result of interest income earned on substantially higher cash balances and short term investments reflecting primarily the investment of the proceeds of the company s august public offering 
other income  net 
other income of million was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal representing the net gain realized from the cash sale of the company s wholly owned subsidiary  amt  to the management group and employees of amt 
no other expense or other income was recorded during fiscal income taxes 
the company recorded income tax expense for fiscal of  the combined effective tax rate of for fiscal reflects the use of net operating loss carryforwards nols 
the company s ability to use its nols against taxable income may be subject to restrictions and limitations under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  in the event of a change in ownership of the company as defined therein 
years ended march  and revenues 
the company s revenues increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was due primarily to increasing volume in sales of pcs products  reflecting the build out of the us pcs network infrastructure  and continued strong gsm product sales 
cost of sales 
the company s cost of sales increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross margin on sales in fiscal declined to from in fiscal during fiscal the company introduced new products into manufacturing to meet customer and market demands 
the need to produce many of these products in high volumes during their manufacturing infancy resulted in much higher costs for the related material  labor and overhead 
the heavy new product volume had a detrimental effect on the company s fiscal gross margins and profitability 
research and development 
the company s r d expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  r d expenses declined slightly to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in r d expenses primarily reflected nine months of development expenses for the company s inch wafer fabrication facility as compared to only three months in fiscal as well as increased r d hiring and the associated recruiting and salary costs 
selling  general and administrative 
the company s sg a expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal sg a expenses as a percentage of revenues increased slightly to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in sg a expenses from fiscal to fiscal was primarily attributable to increases in sales and marketing headcount and the related salaries and expense benefits  as well as outside commissions expenses required to support the company s expanding customer base and product portfolio 
interest income expense  net 
net interest expense for fiscal was  compared to net interest income of  in fiscal the change between fiscal and fiscal primarily reflects decreased interest income as a result of lower average cash balances in fiscal and the interest expense incurred as a result of the company utilizing various debt financing instruments during fiscal income taxes 
the company did not record a provision for income taxes in fiscal because the company incurred a net loss 
an income tax provision of  was recorded in fiscal  an effective tax rate of after use of nols from prior periods 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its growth through its initial public offering in august  a public equity offering in august  private sales of equity securities  capital equipment leases  bank lines of credit and cash flows from operations 
cash provided by operations was million in fiscal  while cash used by operations in fiscal was million 
the cash provided by operations for fiscal was principally generated by the company s profits over the first three quarters of the fiscal year 
the cash used by operations in fiscal was principally for purchasing inventory to support production growth for increasing product shipment volumes 
as of march   the company had working capital of million including million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
in addition  the company has a revolving line of credit of million with a bank secured by the majority of the company s assets 
under the terms of the master agreement governing this credit instrument  the company is required to maintain certain minimum working capital  net worth  profitability and other specific financial ratios 
as of march   the company was in compliance with all of these financial covenants with the exception of the profitability covenant with respect to which covenant the lender granted a waiver to the company 
there were no borrowings outstanding against this line of credit as of march  in april  the company announced a repurchase program the repurchase program pursuant to which it may acquire up to one million shares of common stock in open market purchases 
to date  no shares have been repurchased under the repurchase program 
in january  the company borrowed million under a term loan secured by certain capital equipment 
the loan  which expires in january  requires the payment of monthly principal plus interest and is subject to certain minimum working capital  net worth and other specific financial ratios 
the company was in compliance with these covenants as of march  in march  the company also secured a million real estate loan  which expires in april  for the purchase of a light industrial building for its future facilities expansion 
additions to property and equipment were million for fiscal and million in fiscal capital additions for fiscal included the purchase of new corporate management information systems software  manufacturing test and production equipment required to support new products and increase factory capacity  and test equipment to support various research and development projects 
the company anticipates spending approximately million over the next months for capital additions primarily to support manufacturing capacity requirements  development projects and facilities expansion 
based on the company s current working capital position  the cash flows the company expects to generate from fiscal operations and the available line of credit the company expects to renew  the company believes that sufficient resources will be available to meet the company s cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months depend on the company s profitability  timing and level of capital expenditures  working capital requirements and rate of growth 
factors affecting future operating results customer concentration  dependence on northern telecom 
the wireless infrastructure equipment market is dominated by a small number of large oems  including ericsson  lucent  motorola  northern telecom  nortel matra and siemens ag 
the company s revenues are derived primarily from sales to a limited number of these oems  particularly northern telecom and nortel matra 
during fiscal northern telecom  nortel matra and lgic accounted for approximately  and of revenues  respectively 
during fiscal  northern telecom and nortel matra accounted for approximately and of revenues  respectively 
during fiscal  northern telecom and nortel matra accounted for approximately and of revenues  respectively 
furthermore  a substantial portion of revenues from northern telecom and nortel matra in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal resulted from sales of a limited number of the company s products 
the company s business  financial condition and results of operations have been materially adversely affected in the past by anticipated orders failing to materialize and by deferrals or cancellations of orders as a result of changes in oem requirements 
the company  northern telecom and nortel matra have an agreement  renegotiated annually  pursuant to which northern telecom and nortel matra commit to purchase a certain volume of their annual power amplifier requirements for specified prices from the company 
the renewal of the company s agreement with northern telecom and nortel matra for calendar year was finalized in october based on lower rf amplifier volume commitments and reduced pricing contained in this agreement  the recent slowdown in demand for tdma products and delays in the korean pcs system build out  as well as other factors  the company expects that the company s recent significant growth in revenues will not be sustainable 
the company also anticipates that the company s fiscal revenues may not meet  and will not exceed  fiscal revenues 
in addition  there can be no assurance that northern telecom and nortel matra will enter into a contract as favorable to the company  if any  in the future otherwise agree to purchase the same or similar levels of their power amplifier requirements at the same or similar pricing 
any reduction in the level of purchases of the company s amplifiers by northern telecom and nortel matra  or any material reduction in pricing without significant offsets  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  if the company were to lose northern telecom or any other major oem customer  or if orders by northern telecom or any other major oem customer were to otherwise materially decrease  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the recent financial market turmoil and economic downturn in korea may have a material adverse effect on the company s sales of its products to lgic  an oem based in korea  because a majority of the company s products ordered by lgic to date relate to the build out of the korean pcs system 
in addition  because the company s products are priced in us dollars  the currency instability in the korean and other asian financial markets may have the effect of making the company s products more expensive to lgic than those of other manufacturers whose products are priced in one of the affected asian currencies  and  therefore  lgic may reduce future purchases of the company s products 
in addition  wireless infrastructure equipment oems have come under increasing price pressure from wireless service providers  which in turn has resulted in downward pricing pressure on the company s products 
the company expects to incur increasing pricing pressures from northern telecom and other major oem customers in future periods  which could result in declining average sales prices for the company s products

fluctuations in operating results 
the company s quarterly and annual results have in the past been  and will continue to be  subject to significant fluctuations due to a number of factors  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in particular  the company s results of operations are likely to vary due to the timing  cancellation  delay or rescheduling of oem customer orders and shipments  the timing of announcements or introductions of new products by the company  its competitors or their respective oem customers  the acceptance of such products by wireless equipment oems and their customers  relative variations in manufacturing efficiencies  yields and costs  competitive factors such as the pricing  availability  and demand for competing amplification products  changes in average sales prices and product mix  variations in operating expenses  changes in manufacturing capacity and variations in the utilization of this capacity  shortages of key supplies  the long sales cycles associated with the company s customer specific products  the timing and level of product and process development costs  and changes in inventory levels  and most recently  the relative strength or weakness of international financial markets 
anticipated orders from the company s oem customers have in the past failed to materialize and delivery schedules have been deferred or canceled as a result of changes in oem customer requirements and the company expects this pattern to continue as customer requirements continue to change and industry standards continue to evolve 
reduced demand for wireless infrastructure equipment in the latter part of fiscal and the early part of fiscal  driven partly by delays in the build out of pcs infrastructure  caused significant fluctuations in the company s product sales during that period of time 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience such fluctuations in the future  and  in fact  the company experienced a significant reduction in product revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal and anticipates lower product revenues over the next two to three quarters as a result of softening demand in the tdma markets and delays in korean pcs demand due to the unstable asian financial markets and general economic conditions in korea and other asian countries 
the company establishes its expenditure levels for product development and other operating expenses based on its expected revenues  and expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
as a result  variations in timing of revenues can cause significant variations in quarterly results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be profitable on a quarter to quarter basis in the future 
the company believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
due to all the foregoing factors  it is likely that in some future quarter or quarters the company s revenues or operating results will not meet the expectations of public stock market analysts or investors 
in such event  the market price of the company s common stock would be materially adversely affected 
internal amplifier design and production capabilities of oems 
the company believes that a majority of the present worldwide production of power amplifiers is captive within the manufacturing operations of wireless equipment oems  many of which have chosen not to purchase amplifiers from outside suppliers 
the company also believes that those oems that purchase from third party amplifier vendors are reluctant to switch once committed to a particular merchant vendor 
consequently  the company has only limited opportunities to increase revenues by replacing internal oem amplifier production or displacing other merchant amplifier suppliers 
moreover  given the limited opportunities for merchant rf amplifier suppliers  any decision by an oem to employ a second source merchant supplier for a product currently purchased from a merchant supplier may reduce the existing merchant supplier s ability to maintain a given level of product sales to such oem or  possibly  to retain the oem as a customer due to price competition from the second source merchant supplier 
there can be no assurance that the company s major oem customers will continue to rely  or increase their reliance  on the company as an external source of supply for their power amplifiers  or that other wireless equipment oems will become customers of the company 
if the major wireless infrastructure equipment suppliers do not purchase or continue to purchase their power amplifiers from merchant suppliers  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
see business oem customers  sales and marketing 
rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  dependence on new products 
the markets in which the company and its oem customers compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and continuous improvements in products and services 
in particular  because the company s strategy of rapidly bringing to market products customized for numerous and evolving rf modulation standards requires developing and achieving volume production of a large number of distinct products  the company s ability to rapidly design and produce individual products for which there is significant oem customer demand will be a critical determinant of the company s future success 
for example  continued softening of demand in the tdma market or failure of another modulation standard in which the company has invested substantial development resources may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
no assurance can be given that the company s product development efforts will be successful  that its new products will meet customer requirements and be accepted or that its oem customers product offerings will achieve customer acceptance 
if a significant number of development projects do not result in substantial volume production or if technologies or standards supported by the company s or its customers products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance  the company s business may be materially adversely affected

risks associated with internal wafer and device fabrication 
the company s operation of its wafer and device fabrication facilities entails a number of risks  including a high level of fixed and variable costs  the management of complex processes  dependence on a single source of supply and a strict regulatory environment 
during periods of low demand  high fixed wafer fabrication costs are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the design and fabrication of rf semiconductors is a complex and precise process 
such manufacturing is sensitive to a wide variety of factors  including variations and impurities in the raw materials  quality control of the packages  difficulties in the fabrication process  performance of the manufacturing equipment  defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer and the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment 
as a result of these and other factors  semiconductor manufacturing yields from time to time in the past have suffered  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve acceptable production yields in the future 
in addition  the company s wafer and device fabrication facility represents a single point of failure in its manufacturing process that would be costly and time consuming to replace if its operation were interrupted 
the interruption of wafer fabrication operations or the loss of employees dedicated to the wafer and device fabrication facilities could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
any failure to maintain acceptable wafer and device production levels  will have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see business manufacturing and facilities 
product quality  performance and reliability 
the company expects that its customers will continue to establish demanding specifications for quality  performance and reliability that must be met by the company s products 
rf semiconductors as complex as those offered by the company often encounter development delays and may contain undetected defects or failures when first introduced or after commencement of commercial shipments 
the company has from time to time in the past experienced product quality  performance or reliability problems 
in addition  multicarrier power amplifiers have a higher probability of malfunction than single carrier power amplifiers because of their greater complexity 
there can be no assurance that defects or failures will not occur in the future relating to the company s product quality  performance and reliability that may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see business manufacturing 
sole or limited sources of materials and services 
the company currently procures from single sources certain components and services for its products including cast housings  printed circuit boards  specialized rf components and specialized subassemblies 
the company purchases these components and services on a purchase order basis  does not carry significant inventories of these components and does not have any long term supply contracts with its sole source vendors 
although the company is currently identifying potential alternative sources of these components  its reliance on sole sources entails certain risks  including reduced control over the price  timely delivery  reliability and quality of the components 
if the company were to change any of its sole source vendors  the company would be required to requalify the components with each new vendor 
any inability of the company to obtain timely deliveries of components of acceptable quality in required quantities or a significant increase in the prices of components for which the company does not have alternative sources could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company has occasionally experienced difficulties in obtaining these components  and no assurance can be given that shortages will not occur in the future 
see business manufacturing 
declining average sales prices 
the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  declining average sales prices for its products 
wireless infrastructure equipment manufacturers have come under increasing price pressure from wireless service providers  which in turn has resulted in downward pricing pressure on the company s products 
in addition  competition among merchant suppliers has increased the downward pricing pressure on the company s products 
since wireless infrastructure equipment manufacturers frequently negotiate supply arrangements far in advance of delivery dates  the company often must commit to price reductions for its products before it is aware of how  or if  cost reductions can be obtained 
to offset declining average sales prices  the company believes that it must achieve manufacturing cost reductions 
if the company is unable to achieve such cost reductions  the company s gross margins will decline  and such decline will have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see business manufacturing 
risks of international sales 
sales outside of the united states were  and of revenues in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the company expects that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of the company s total revenues for the foreseeable future 
these sales involve a number of inherent risks  including imposition of government controls  currency exchange fluctuations  potential insolvency of international distributors and representatives or customers  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  the impact of recessionary environments in economies outside the united states  political instability and generally longer receivables collection periods  as well as tariffs and other trade barriers 
in addition  because substantially all of the company s foreign sales are denominated in us dollars  increases in the value of the dollar relative to the local currency would increase the price of the company s products in foreign markets and make the company s products relatively more expensive and less price competitive than competitors products that are priced in local currencies 
there can be no assurance that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future international sales and  consequently  on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company anticipates that the recent turmoil in asian financial markets and the recent deterioration of the underlying economic conditions in certain asian countries may have an impact on its sales to customers located in or whose projects are based in those countries due to the impact of currency fluctuations on the relative price of the company s products and restrictions on government spending imposed by the imf on those countries receiving the imf s assistance 
in addition  customers in those countries may face reduced access to working capital to fund component purchases  such as the company s products  due to higher interest rates  reduced bank lending due to contractions in the money supply or the deterioration in the customer s or its bank s financial condition or the inability to access local equity financing 
a substantial majority of the company s products are sold to oems who incorporate the company s products into systems sold and installed to end user customers 
these oems are not required by contract and do not typically provide the company with information regarding the location and identity of their end user customers  and  therefore  the company is not able to determine what portion of its product sales have been or future orders will be incorporated into oem sales to end users in those asian countries currently experiencing financial market turmoil and or deterioration of economic conditions 
furthermore  a large portion of the company s existing customers and potential new customers are servicing new markets in developing countries that the company s customers expect will deploy wireless communication networks as an alternative to the construction of a wireline infrastructure 
if such countries decline to construct wireless communication systems  or construction of such systems is delayed for any reason  including business and economic conditions and changes in economic stability due to factors such as increased inflation and political turmoil  such delays could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
see business oem customers  sales and marketing 
reliance upon growth of wireless services 
sales of power amplifiers to wireless infrastructure equipment suppliers have in the past accounted  and are expected in the future to account  for substantially all of the company s product sales 
demand for wireless infrastructure equipment is driven by demand for wireless service 
although demand for power amplifiers has grown in recent years  if demand for wireless services fails to increase or increases more slowly than the company or its oem customers currently anticipate  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
see business industry background 
market for the company s products is highly competitive 
the wireless communications equipment industry is extremely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change  new product development and product obsolescence  evolving industry standards and significant price erosion over the life of a product 
the ability of the company to compete successfully and sustain profitability depends in part upon the rates at which wireless equipment oems incorporate the company s products into their systems and the company captures market share from other merchant suppliers 
the company s major oem customers  including northern telecom  nortel matra  lgic and qualcomm  continuously evaluate whether to manufacture their own amplification products or purchase them from outside sources 
there can be no assurance that these oem customers will incorporate the company s products into their systems or that in general they will continue to rely  or expand their reliance  on external sources of supply for their power amplifiers 
these customers and other large manufacturers of wireless communications equipment could also elect to enter the merchant market and compete directly with the company  and at least one oem  nec  has already done so 
such increased competition could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see internal amplifier design and production capabilities of oems 
the company s principal competitors in the market for wireless amplification products provided by merchant suppliers currently include aml communications  amplidyne  hewlett packard wireless infrastructure division  m a com a subsidiary of amp  microwave power devices  nec and powerwave technologies 
no assurance can be given that the company s competitors will not develop new technologies or enhancements to existing products or introduce new products that will offer superior price or performance features compared to the company s products 
see business competition 
uncertain protection of intellectual property 
the company s ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth will depend  in part  on its ability to protect its proprietary technology and operate without infringing the rights of others 
the company has a policy of seeking patents on inventions resulting from its ongoing research and development activities 
the company has been awarded united states patents  and has united states patent applications pending  including five that had been allowed but not yet formally issued 
the company also has been awarded four foreign patents and has ten foreign patent applications pending 
there can be no assurance that the company s pending patent applications will be allowed or that the issued or pending patents will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors 
notwithstanding the company s active pursuit of patent protection  the company believes that the success of its business depends more on the collective value of its patents  specifications  computer aided design and modeling tools  technical processes and employee expertise 
the company generally enters into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with its employees  suppliers  oem customers  and potential customers and limits access to and distribution of its proprietary technology 
however  there can be no assurance that such measures will provide adequate protection for the company s trade secrets or other proprietary information  or that the company s trade secrets or proprietary technology will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
the failure of the company to protect its proprietary technology could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
see business patents and proprietary technology 
risk of third party claims of infringement 
the communications equipment industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions  which have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
although there is currently no pending intellectual property litigation against the company  the company or its suppliers may from time to time be notified of claims that the company may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties 
if it is necessary or desirable  the company may seek licenses under such patents or other intellectual property rights 
however  there can be no assurance that licenses will be offered or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to the company 
the failure to obtain a license from a third party for technology used by the company or otherwise secure rights to use such technology could cause the company to incur substantial liabilities  to suspend the manufacture of products or expend significant resources to develop noninfringing technology 
there can be no assurance that the company would be successful in such development or that such licenses would be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
in the event that any third party makes a successful claim against the company or its customers and either a license is not made available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or a design around is not practicable  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
furthermore  the company may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of the company s proprietary rights or to establish the validity of the company s proprietary rights 
litigation by or against the company could result in significant expense to the company and divert the efforts of the company s technical and management personnel  whether or not such litigation results in a favorable determination for the company 
in the event of an adverse result in any such litigation  the company could be required to pay substantial damages  indemnify its customers  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop noninfringing technology  discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
see business patents and proprietary technology 
government regulation of communications industry 
radio frequency transmissions and emissions  and certain equipment used in connection therewith  are regulated in the united states  canada and throughout the rest of the world 
regulatory approvals generally must be obtained by the company in connection with the manufacture and sale of its products  and by wireless service providers to operate the company s products 
the united states federal communications commission the fcc and regulatory authorities abroad constantly review rf emission issues and promulgate standards based on such reviews 
if more stringent rf emission regulations are adopted  the company and its oem customers may be required to alter the manner in which radio signals are transmitted or otherwise alter the equipment transmitting such signals  which could materially adversely affect the company s products and markets 
the enactment by federal  state  local or international governments of new laws or regulations or a change in the interpretation of existing regulations could also materially adversely affect the market for the company s products 
although recent deregulation of international communications industries along with recent radio frequency spectrum allocations made by the fcc have increased the potential demand for the company s products by providing users of those products with opportunities to establish new wireless personal communications services  there can be no assurance that the trend toward deregulation and current regulatory developments favorable to the promotion of new and expanded personal communications services will continue or that other future regulatory changes will have a positive impact on the company 
the increasing demand for wireless communications has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards for such products  generally following extensive investigation of and deliberation over competing technologies
