each of the company s wholly owned subsidiaries has guaranteed the company s payment obligations under the debentures  so long as such subsidiary is member of an affiliated group within the meaning of sections g of the internal revenue code of  as amended which includes the company 
the satisfaction by the company s subsidiaries of their contractual guarantees  as well as the payment of dividends and certain loans and advances to the company by such subsidiaries  may be subject to certain statutory or contractual restrictions  are contingent upon the earnings of such subsidiaries and are subject to various business considerations 
the company expects to meet future financing needs principally through the use of its revolving credit facility

the tax rates differ from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of state and local income taxes and the non deductibility of certain acquisition costs 
year compliance computer systems in use after the beginning of the year will need to accept four digit entries in the date code field in order to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
consequently  many companies face significant uncertainties because of the need to upgrade or replace their currently installed computer systems to comply with such year requirements 
various systems could be affected ranging from complex information technology it computer systems to non it devices such as an individual machine s programmable logic controller 
the company has reviewed all internal systems and believes its currently installed information systems are year compliant 
however  there can be no assurance that coding errors or other defects will not be discovered in the future 
the total cost of the systems review has been immaterial to the financial results of the company 
future costs related to year issues are also expected to be immaterial to the financial results of the company 
the company is currently determining the extent to which it may be impacted by any third parties failure to remediate their own year issues the company has initiated formal communications with all significant customers  suppliers  payors and other third parties to determine the extent  if any  to which the company s interface systems could be impacted by those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
the company will continue these communications throughout fiscal although the company currently does not anticipate any material adverse impact on its operations as a result of year issues of third parties  at this stage of the review no assurance can be given that the failure by one or more third parties to become year compliant will not have a material adverse impact on its operations 
management of the company believes it has an effective program in place to resolve the year issue in a timely manner 
nevertheless  since it is not possible to anticipate all possible future outcomes  especially when third parties are involved  there could be circumstances in which the company s operations could be interrupted 
in addition  disruptions in the economy in general resulting from year issues could also adversely impact the company 
the company has contingency plans for certain critical applications and are working on plans for others
