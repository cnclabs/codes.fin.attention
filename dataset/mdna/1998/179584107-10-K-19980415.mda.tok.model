year in prior years  certain computer programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
these programs were written without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century and may experience problems handling dates beyond the year this could cause certain computer applications to fail or to create erroneous results unless corrective measures are taken 
incomplete or untimely resolution of the year issue could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  operations or financial condition in the future 
the company has  however  been assessing the impact that the year issue will have on its computer systems since  and in response to these assessments  which are ongoing  the company has developed a plan to inventory critical systems and develop solutions to those systems that are found to have date related deficiencies 
project plans call for the completion of the solution implementation phase and testing of those solutions prior to any anticipated impact on our systems 
based on our work to date  and assuming that our project plans  which continue to evolve  can be implemented as planned  we believe future costs relating to the year issue will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
