year ended december  vs 
year ended december  the company s net sales for were million  representing an increase of from sales of million 
the increase in net sales was primarily the result of the increase in the sales of distributed products and the acquisition of tbp 
sales of manufactured products in  compared to sales in  decreased by 
as a consequence of the disruption caused by the consolidation of the lexington  north carolina operations into the oshkosh  wisconsin facility and the late delivery of the new high speed door manufacturing line 
reflecting the temporary lack of capacity  the backlog of orders for manufactured products at december  was greater than at december  management believes that the sales increase for distributed products is a reflection of market share gains  as well as the high level of single family housing starts 
single family starts were higher in than the average for the five year period from to the gross profit increase of million from to was primarily the result of the aforementioned increase in sales at the distribution division and the acquisition of tbp 
manufacturing gross margins in were reduced over those in by a 
million inventory shortage created by factors associated with the plant consolidation and the pressures to adequately service customer needs

significant business trends uncertainties management believes that single family housing starts have a significant influence on the company s level of business activity 
currently available industry data suggests that housing starts for single family dwellings decreased in from despite this decline  the start rate for single family homes was at the third highest level in the last years 
the national association of home builders nahb forecasts despite an expected overall economic slowdown in  the nahb expects low interest rates to help the housing market which will result in only a slight decline from the previous year 
no assurances can be given  however  that single family housing starts will not decline more severely 
management also believes that the company s ability to continue to penetrate the residential repair and remodeling markets through sales to home center chains may have a significant influence on the company s level of business activity 
management believes this market will continue to grow in importance to the company 
however  sales to these home center chain customers as a percentage of total sales decreased from in to in  representing a million decrease in sales volume 
distribution sales to these customers as a percentage of total sales decreased from in to in  representing a million decrease in sales volume 
management further believes that in certain areas of the united states  sales by distributors directly to the end user may over time replace  as the primary channel of distribution  the distribution method of selling to the retail dealer  who then sells to the end user 
the company intends to respond aggressively to such changes in distribution methods  including  where opportunities permit  through the acquisition of distribution businesses that sell directly to the end user 
strategic initiatives an important part of the company s strategic plan is to expand its distribution capabilities  particularly in the southeast and southwest  or in other areas  if attractive opportunities are presented 
in august  the company acquired substantially all of the business and assets of tbp  a regional millwork and specialty building products distributor and light manufacturer headquartered in nashville  tennessee 
with the tbp acquisition  the company expanded its operations to include nashville and chattanooga  tennessee  charlotte  north carolina  greenville  south carolina  and huntsville  alabama 
in july  the company acquired certain assets of wahlfeld  a distributor of windows  doors  and other millwork products headquartered in peoria  illinois 
the company consolidated wahlfeld s operation into two of its existing facilities 
with the february  sale of manufacturing  company debt was reduced by half 
the company entered into a new credit facility with its bank group which includes a million revolving credit sub line for permitted acquisitions 
this additional capital will provide funding for the strategic plan described above 
in  andersen determined to sell its fibrex window systems through renewal by andersen retail stores 
fibrex is a proprietary material developed by andersen that is made of a composite of wood fibers and vinyl and is considered to be superior in certain characteristics to pure vinyl core window systems 
the renewal by andersen store which is aimed at the replacement window buyer is devoted exclusively to the promotion and sale of such systems  with the stores being established in various areas throughout the country and principally owned and operated by independent distributors 
the company opened one of the first such stores in overland park  kansas which has performed at lower than expected levels 
as of december   the company has not opened any additional renewal by anderson retail stores 
the company believes that its relationship with andersen has improved in recent years 
in april  the company entered the louisiana market where it was awarded sole distribution rights for andersen s products 
in  the company was also awarded sole distribution for andersen s products in most counties in mississippi and some in texas 
as the final major element of its strategic initiatives  the company is committed to improving its management information systems 
a new company wide integrated management information system has been selected and is being implemented 
the company approved total capital expenditures of million for the new management information system project  which has been financed through a combination of capital leases and borrowings under the company s revolving line of credit 
as of december   the company has incurred a cost of approximately million for the management information system 
upon completion of this project  the company will have achieved significant progress in meeting its goal of being the industry leader in customer friendly order processing and fulfillment systems 
management believes that the final implementation of the project will be completed in liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital requirements are related to its sales level  which  because of its dependency upon housing starts and the repair and remodeling market  is seasonal and  to a degree  weather dependent 
this seasonality affects the need for working capital inasmuch as it is necessary to carry larger inventories and receivables during certain months of the year 
working capital at december  was million  with a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of to  while at december  working capital was million  with a current ratio of to working capital of million at december  includes million of manufacturing property  plant and equipment pp e held for sale 
excluding pp e held for sale  the company s working capital decreased million from the million decrease in working capital was primarily due to reduced inventory of million 
additionally  million in manufacturing inventory was reclassified to assets held for sale 
the decline in inventory is a continuance of the company s plan to reduce working capital and interest on long term debt 
accounts receivable decreased million after million was reclassified to assets held for sale 
the decrease in accounts payable of million was offset by increased liabilities related to the provision for loss on the sale of manufacturing 
long term debt  net of cash  increased to million at december  from million at december  the company s ratio of long term debt  net of cash  to total capitalization increased from at december  to at december  this increase was due to additional borrowings required to offset continued losses in operations and additional borrowings for the wahlfeld acquisition 
cash generated by operating activities totaled million in by comparison  the period ended december  reflected cash used by operations of million 
the improvement is primarily due to the continued reductions in inventory levels 
investing activities in used million  principally consisting of payments to acquire wahlfeld of million  the final payment to acquire tbp of million and payments to purchase capital equipment of million 
investing activities in used million  primarily for the acquisition of tbp 
financing activities generated million of cash in  with a million increase in debt under the revolving line of credit  the repayment of million of debt  and million net proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
financing activities in generated million of cash from additional borrowings  net of debt repayments and net proceeds from the company s public offering of its common stock in prior to the sale of manufacturing  the company maintained a credit agreement the old credit agreement with a group of banks which provided for a revolving credit facility of up to million and an incremental acquisition term loan line of million through july  at december   million of borrowings were outstanding on the revolving credit facility and million of borrowings were outstanding on the acquisition term loan line 
on february  in connection with the sale of manufacturing  the company and the same group of banks entered into an amended and restated credit agreement the new credit agreement 
the new credit agreement reduced the revolving credit facility to million which includes an acquisition sub line of million 
the new credit agreement also introduced an interest rate matrix and extended the credit facility through february  the new credit agreement requires the company  among other things  to maintain minimum interest coverage  fixed charge coverage ratios  and maximum levels of debt to earnings before income taxes and depreciation and amortization ratios 
for the period between december  through the effective date of the new credit agreement  the company s lenders waived its technical default resulting from losses associated with the disposition of manufacturing with respect to certain financial covenants under the old credit agreement 
restructuring of operations since  the company has adopted a comprehensive strategic plan to restore profitability and regain industry leadership by providing customers with quality products and optimum service at the best price value relationship 
the company has taken a series of major initiatives to implement this plan and respond to continuing challenges in the industry 
in and  the company incurred million and  in restructuring charges  respectively  to cover the costs of closing the company s springfield  oregon door and weed  california veneer plants  the downsizing of manufacturing  company wide management restructure charges including terminations and the elimination of certain positions  the restructuring of distribution operations  the relocation of the company s corporate headquarters  and other cost reduction and consolidation actions 
in the second quarter of  the company sold its lexington  north carolina door manufacturing facility 
the entire line of doors  previously manufactured in lexington  was shifted to the company s oshkosh door manufacturing facility 
the company recorded restructuring charges in of million  primarily related to the sale of the lexington facility and the consolidation of door manufacturing operations into the oshkosh facility 
in  the company recorded an additional restructuring charge of million for excessive costs incurred as a consequence of the consolidation of manufacturing operations and the delayed start up of the new high speed door manufacturing line 
additionally  the company recorded a million reorganization charge in in connection with the termination of the employment of the vice president and chief financial officer and senior vice president human resources and administration of the company 
such provision is to cover severance and related payments to such officers 
although manufacturing had made progress operationally in the first half of  the company determined that manufacturing was not a strategic fit in december  the company reached an agreement in principle to sell the operating assets of manufacturing to jeld wen  inc 
the sale was completed on february  the sale resulted in a charge to earnings of million with approximately half the charge related to an asset write down and half related to the costs of selling the business including employee severance costs  pension expenses  lease obligations and legal costs 
year issues the company has investigated the extent to which its computer operations are subject to year issues 
the company has assessed the measures it believes will be necessary to avoid any material disruption to its operations relating to year complications in the company s computers 
the company is currently implementing a company wide integrated management information system that is year compatible 
management believes that the cost to the company of the necessary modifications and upgrades to the company s computer systems  not including the costs of implementing the new management information system  will not be material 
the company has not conducted a detailed investigation of the year readiness of its material suppliers 
it is uncertain whether such suppliers will be prepared fully for year issues 
based on inquiries it has received from many of its largest customers  management believes such customers are assessing their year issues 
there can be no assurances  however  that none of the company s customers will have a year issue that adversely affects the company 
seasonal nature of business the building products industry is seasonal  particularly in the northeast and midwest regions of the united states  where inclement weather during the winter months usually reduces the level of building activity in both the improvement  maintenance and repair market and the new construction market 
the company s lowest sales levels generally occur during the first and fourth quarters 
since a high percentage of the company s overhead and expenses are relatively fixed throughout the year  profits tend to be lower in quarters with lower sales 
however  the company s acquisition of tbp in the third quarter of  which serves the more moderate climates  should partially offset the effect of seasonal influences on the company s operations 
the company believes that the seasonal effect on operations will be unchanged as a result of the sale of manufacturing
