item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s revenues consist of staffing services and professional employer organization peo services 
staffing services revenues consist of short term staffing  contract staffing and on site management 
peo services refer exclusively to co employer contractual agreements with peo clients 
the company s revenues represent all amounts billed to customers for direct payroll  related employment taxes  workers compensation coverage and a service fee equivalent to a mark up percentage 
the company s oregon branches accounted for approximately of its total revenues in  and an additional was derived from its branches in california and washington 
consequently  weakness in economic conditions on the west coast could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results 
the company s cost of revenues is comprised of direct payroll costs  payroll taxes and employee benefits  workers compensation and safety incentives 
direct payroll costs represent the gross payroll earned by employees based on salary or hourly wages 
payroll taxes and employee benefits consist of the employer s portion of social security and medicare taxes  federal unemployment taxes  state unemployment taxes and employee reimbursements for materials  supplies and other expenses  which are paid by the customer 
workers compensation expense consists primarily of the costs associated with the company s self insured workers compensation program  such as claims reserves  claims administration fees  legal fees  state and federal administrative agency fees and reinsurance costs for catastrophic injuries 
the company also maintains a large deductible workers compensation insurance policy for employees working in states where the company is not currently self insured 
safety incentives represent cash incentives paid to certain peo client companies as a reward for maintaining safe work practices in order to minimize workplace injuries 
the incentive is based on a percentage of annual payroll and is paid annually to customers who meet predetermined loss parameters 
the largest portion of workers compensation expense is the cost of workplace injury claims 
when an injury occurs and is reported to the company  the company s respective independent third party claims administrator tpa analyzes the details of the injury and develops a case reserve  which is the tpa s estimate of the cost of the claim based on similar injuries and its professional judgment 
the company then records  or accrues  an expense and a corresponding liability based upon the tpa s estimates for claims reserves 
as cash payments are made by the company s tpa against specific case reserves  the accrued liability is reduced by the corresponding payment amount 
the tpa also reviews existing injury claims on an on going basis and adjusts the case reserves as new or additional information for each claim becomes available 
the company has established an additional ibnr reserve to provide for future unanticipated increases in expenses adverse loss development of the claims reserves for open injury claims and for claims incurred but not reported related to prior and current periods 
management believes that the company s internal claims reporting system minimizes the occurrence of unreported incurred claims 
selling  general and administrative expenses represent both branch and corporate operating expenses 
branch operating expenses consist primarily of branch office staff payroll and payroll related costs  advertising  rent  office supplies  depreciation and branch incentive compensation 
branch incentive compensation represents a combined of branch pre tax profits  of which is paid to the branch manager and is shared among the office staff 
corporate operating expenses consist primarily of executive and office staff payroll and payroll related costs  professional and legal fees  travel  depreciation  occupancy costs  information systems costs and executive and corporate staff incentive bonuses 
amortization of intangibles consists primarily of the amortization of the costs of acquisitions in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired goodwill 
the company uses a year estimate as the useful life of goodwill  as compared to the year maximum permitted by generally accepted accounting principles  and amortizes such cost using the straight line method 
other intangible assets  such as customer lists and covenants not to compete  are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  which range from two to years

gross margin for totaled  representing an increase of  or over the gross margin rate of of revenues represents a basis point decline from due primarily to increases in direct payroll costs as a percentage of revenues 
direct payroll costs as a percentage of revenues increased primarily as a result of increased business activity in contract staffing and on site management arrangements 
the company expects gross margin  as a percentage of revenues  to continue to be influenced by increases or decreases in contract staffing and on site management arrangements  as well as by the adequacy of its estimates for workers compensation liabilities  which may be negatively affected by unanticipated adverse loss development of claims reserves 
the increase in direct payroll costs as a percentage of revenues from for to for was primarily attributable to increased business activity in contract staffing and on site management arrangements  which are typically higher volume  lower margin accounts 
workers compensation expense increased from of revenues for to of revenues for the increase in the total number of injury claims for over was due in large part to a new policy implemented in which records first aid type claims

selling  general and administrative sg a expenses excluding the amortization of intangibles for amounted to approximately million  an increase of approximately million or over selling  general and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues decreased from for to for the increase in total sg a dollars for over was primarily attributable to incremental branch office expenses as a result of the four acquisitions since october   the opening of four new offices in and early  the addition of experienced personnel at several offices to expand the company s managerial resources and a million increase in bad debt expense 
two customers accounted for over one half of the increase in bad debt expense 
management believes that the company s allowance for doubtful accounts of  is adequate at december  there can be no assurance  however  that future experience with respect to the company s ability to collect accounts receivable will not be adverse 
amortization of intangibles totaled  for or of revenues  which compares to  or of revenues for the increased amortization expense for was primarily attributable to amortization arising from the four acquisitions made since october  the company offers various qualified employee benefit plans to its employees  including its worksite employees 
these qualified employee benefit plans include a savings plan the k plan under section k of the internal revenue code the code  a cafeteria plan under code section  a group health plan  a group life insurance plan  a group disability insurance plan and an employee assistance plan 
generally  qualified employee benefit plans are subject to provisions of both the code and erisa 
in order to qualify for favorable tax treatment under the code  qualified plans must be established and maintained by an employer for the exclusive benefit of its employees 
a definitive judicial interpretation of employer in the context of a peo arrangement has not been established 
the tax exempt status of the company s k plan and cafeteria plan is subject to continuing scrutiny and approval by the internal revenue service the irs and depends upon the company s ability to establish the company s employer employee relationship with peo employees 
the issue of whether the company s tax qualified benefit plans can legitimately include worksite employees under their coverage has not yet been resolved 
if the worksite employees cannot be covered by the plans  then the exclusive benefit requirement imposed by the code would not be met by the plans as currently administered and the plans could be disqualified 
the irs has established a market segment study group regarding employee leasing for the stated purpose of examining whether peos  such as the company  are the employers of worksite employees under the code provisions applicable to employee benefit plans and are  therefore  able to offer to worksite employees benefit plans that qualify for favorable tax treatment 
the irs study group is reportedly also examining whether the owners of client companies are employees of peo companies under code provisions applicable to employee benefit plans 
to the best of the company s knowledge  the market segment study group has not issued a report 
a peo company headquartered in texas has stated publicly that the irs national office is being requested by the irs houston district to issue a technical advice memorandum tam on the peo worksite employee issue in connection with an ongoing audit of a plan of the texas peo company 
the stated purpose of tams is to help irs personnel in closing cases and to establish and maintain consistent holdings 
the irs s position is that tams are not precedential  that is  they are limited to the particular taxpayer involved and that taxpayer s set of facts 
the draft request for a tam by the irs houston district reportedly states its determination that the texas peo company s code section k plan should be disqualified for the reason  among others  that it covers worksite employees who are not employees of the peo company 
the timing and nature of the issuance and contents of any tam regarding the worksite employee issue or any report of the market segment study group regarding employee leasing is unknown at this time 
there has also been public discussion of the possibility that the treasury department may propose some form of administrative relief or that congress may provide legislative resolution or clarification regarding this issue 
in the event the tax exempt status of the company s benefit plans were to be discontinued and the benefit plans were to be disqualified  such actions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the company is not presently able to predict the likelihood of disqualification nor the resulting range of loss  in light of the lack of public direction from the irs or congress 
years ended december  and net income for amounted to  an increase of  or over net income of  the increase in net income from was primarily due to continued growth in revenues and gross margin  which was offset in part by increased selling  general and administrative expenses 
diluted net income per share for was compared to for total revenues were  which represented an increase of  or over revenues of  the increase in revenues over was primarily due to a internal growth rate of  coupled with the acquisition of five staffing and peo businesses during professional employer staff leasing services revenues increased over due to the growth in the number of new peo clients  primarily in oregon and california 
the growth in peo services revenues was a result of internal sales efforts  together with the acquisitions made during revenues from staffing services  as a percent of total revenues  declined in to as compared to of total revenues in  despite a growth rate over gross margin for totaled  representing an increase of  or over the gross margin rate of of revenues for represented a basis point decrease from due to slight increases in direct payroll costs and payroll taxes and benefits  offset in part by a decrease in workers compensation expense as a percentage of total revenues 
workers compensation expense  both in terms of total dollars and as a percent of total payroll dollars  improved in to  or of revenues  compared to  or of revenues in the decrease in the expense was primarily the result of lower severity for claims  coupled with a slightly lower incidence of injuries compared to selling  general and administrative expenses excluding the amortization of intangibles amounted to  or of revenues for  as compared to  or of revenues for the increase in total dollars for  as compared to  was primarily due to additional branch office staff resulting from the five acquisitions consummated during amortization of intangibles totaled  for  or of revenues  which compared to  or of revenues for the increased amortization expense for over was primarily attributable to the five acquisitions during fluctuations in quarterly operating results the company has historically experienced significant fluctuations in its quarterly operating results and expects such fluctuations to continue in the future 
the company s operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors such as seasonality  wage limits on payroll taxes  claims experience for workers compensation  demand and competition for the company s services and the effect of acquisitions 
the company s revenue levels fluctuate from quarter to quarter primarily due to the impact of seasonality on its staffing services business and on certain of its peo clients in the agriculture and forest products related industries 
as a result  the company may have greater revenues and net income in the third and fourth quarters of its fiscal year 
payroll taxes and benefits fluctuate with the level of direct payroll costs but may tend to represent a smaller percentage of revenues later in the company s fiscal year as federal and state statutory wage limits for unemployment and social security taxes are exceeded by some employees 
workers compensation expense varies with both the frequency and severity of workplace injury claims reported during a quarter  as well as adverse loss development of prior period claims during a subsequent quarter 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash position of  at december  increased  from december  the increase was primarily due to  provided by operations and  provided by the exercise of stock options and warrants  offset by  used for acquisitions   used for the purchase of property and equipment and  used for the repurchase of common stock see discussion below 
net cash provided by operating activities for amounted to  as compared to  for for  cash flow was primarily generated by net income together with increases of  in accrued payroll and benefits and  in accrued workers compensation claim liabilities 
the  increase in other long term liabilities includes the  deferred noncompete agreement arising from the acquisition of hr only and is reflected in the supplemental schedule of noncash activities within the liabilities assumed caption 
net cash used in investing activities totaled  for  as compared to  for during  the company paid  in cash in connection with the hr only and tlc staffing acquisitions and had capital expenditures of  approximately million of the total capital expenditures was related to new computer hardware and software for the company s new management information system  which will address all concerns related to the year issue  as discussed in item under management information system 
during  the company paid  in cash in connection with five acquisitions  incurred  in capital expenditures and had net purchases of  of restricted marketable securities to satisfy various state and federal self insured workers compensation surety deposit requirements 
the company presently has no material long term capital commitments 
net cash used in financing activities for totaled  which compares to  net cash provided by financing activities for for  the principal use of cash used in financing activities arose from the company s obligation to redeem  shares of its common stock at a value of  pursuant to a plan and agreement of reorganization between staffamerica  inc and the company 
the cash used for this stock redemption was offset in part by net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants totaling  as of the date of this report  an underwriter continues to hold warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at per share issued in connection with the company s initial public offering of its common stock 
the unexercised warrants expire on june  the company has an unsecured million revolving credit facility with its principal bank and million for standby letters of credit in connection with certain workers compensation surety arrangements 
there was no outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility at december  see note of the notes to financial statements 
management believes that the credit facility and other potential sources of financing  together with anticipated funds generated from operations  will be sufficient in the aggregate to fund the company s working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
inflation inflation generally has not been a significant factor in the company s operations during the periods discussed above 
the company has taken into account the impact of escalating medical and other costs in establishing reserves for future expenses for self insured workers compensation claims
