louis c 
cosentino  as chairman  chief executive officer  and president 
management determined that the dialyzer product line does not fit within the long term strategy of the company due to the competitive nature of the business and high sales volumes required to be profitable

in april  the company signed a finite risk insurance policy to cover potential future product liability and legal defense exposures 
a payment of million was made in april and future payments of million will be made through april in the event that these exposures do not materialize  the company will recover a portion of these premiums 
the company believes that its strong financial condition at march   along with anticipated cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital equipment needs in fiscal year compliance the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs and products that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in system failures 
the company has reviewed its critical information systems for year compliance and has initiated plans to correct any deficiencies in a timely manner 
as a result of this review and action plan  the company believes the cost of such corrective actions will not be material to the company s operations or financial position 
foreign currency transactions substantially all of the company s united states based export sales are invoiced and paid in united states dollars 
the transactions of the company s netherlands based subsidiary are invoiced and paid in several currencies  including dutch guilders  german marks and united states dollars 
the company does not currently hedge its foreign currency transactions 
accordingly  the company is subject to risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
risk factors certain statements made in this annual report on form k  are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  and actual results may differ 
factors that could cause actual results to differ include those identified below 
competition  uncertainty of technological change 
the markets in which the company competes are highly competitive and are characterized by innovation and technological change 
the company currently competes in each area of the company s business with a number of companies that have capital resources  research and development staffs  facilities  experience in conducting clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approvals  and experience in manufacturing and marketing medical supplies and devices that are significantly greater than those of the company 
in addition  there are several companies developing new technologies that may reduce the demand for the company s existing products  such as minimally invasive techniques in open heart surgery  which may not require the use of oxygenators 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective than any that are being developed by the company or that would render the company s products obsolete or noncompetitive 
in addition  certain of the company s competitors may achieve patent protection  regulatory approval or product commercialization that would limit the company s ability to compete 
the company s inability to compete successfully could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  and results of operations 
reliance on patents and proprietary technology 
the company relies heavily on proprietary technology  which it protects primarily through licensing arrangements  patents  trade secrets  and proprietary know how 
the company holds patents and has pending patent applications that cover certain aspects of its technology 
there can be no assurance that any pending or future patent applications will be granted or that any current or future patents  regardless of whether the company is an owner or a licensee of such patent  will not be challenged  rendered unenforceable  invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder or under its licensing agreements will provide a competitive advantage to the company 
there can also be no assurance that the company s trade secrets or non disclosure agreements will provide meaningful protection of the company s proprietary information 
furthermore  there can also be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by the company or that the company s technology will not infringe upon patents or other rights owned by others 
the company s inability to maintain its proprietary rights would have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  and results of operations 
lack of market acceptance 
the company s principal products are based upon innovative medical concepts 
the company believes that market acceptance of these products will depend  in part  on the company s ability to convince the medical community of the safety  efficacy  convenience  and cost effectiveness of these products as compared to existing competitive products 
market acceptance will further depend on the company s ability to gain acceptance by the medical community of the use of its products 
there can be no assurance that medical professionals will readily adopt new products or approaches  particularly when certain competitors of the company provide a more complete product mix than that offered by the company 
the company s inability to gain market acceptance for its recently introduced biocor tm oxygenator and other products would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
litigation  potential for adverse outcomes 
the medical supply and device market is characterized by frequent and substantial intellectual property litigation 
intellectual property litigation is complex and expensive  and the outcome of such litigation is difficult to predict 
a finding against the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
government regulation 
in the united states  the united states food and drug administration the fda regulates the sale of medical supplies and devices as well as manufacturing procedures  labeling  and recordkeeping with respect to such products 
the process of obtaining marketing clearances and approvals from the fda for new products can be time consuming and expensive  and there is no assurance that such clearances or approvals will be granted or that fda review will not involve delays that would adversely affect the company s ability to commercialize its products 
the fda requires that a new product secure either a k clearance or an approved pma  depending upon its classification  prior to marketing in the united states 
the company s products are currently sold under a k clearance  which is available for products demonstrated to be substantially equivalent to products that are already commercially available 
the k clearance process typically takes several months and may require the submission of supporting laboratory or clinical data 
no assurance can be given that the company will receive fda marketing approval for new products on a timely basis  or at all 
even if regulatory approvals to market a product are obtained from the fda  such approvals may entail limitations on the indicated uses of the product 
product approvals by the fda can also be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory requirements or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval 
the fda could also limit or prevent the manufacture or distribution of the company s products and has the power to require the recall of such products 
a product recall  whether voluntary or mandated by the fda  would have a material adverse effect on the company  particularly at the early stage of market introduction 
fda regulations depend heavily on administrative interpretation  and there can be no assurance that future interpretations made by the fda or other regulatory bodies  with possible retroactive effect  will not adversely affect the company 
the fda  various state agencies  and foreign regulatory agencies inspect the company from time to time to determine whether the company is in compliance with various regulations relating to manufacturing practices  validation  testing  quality control and product labeling 
for example  the united states environmental protection agency regulates the chemical sterilants used in the company s water filtration product line 
a determination that the company is in violation of such regulations could lead to imposition of civil penalties  including fines  product recall orders or product seizures  and  in extreme cases  criminal sanctions 
international regulatory bodies often establish varying regulations governing products standards  packaging requirements  labeling requirements  import restrictions  tariff regulations  duties and tax requirements 
as a result of the company s sales in europe  the company was required to be certified as iso compliant and to receive ce mark certification 
failure to maintain ce mark certification would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
limitations on third party reimbursement 
the company s ability to sell its products depends in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of such products and related treatments are available to patients under domestic and foreign governmental health programs  private health insurance  managed care organizations  workers compensation insurers  and other similar programs 
over the past decade  the cost of health care has risen significantly  and there have been numerous proposals by legislators  regulators  and third party health care payors to curb these costs 
in addition  certain health care providers are moving towards a managed care system in which such providers contract to provide comprehensive health care for a fixed cost per person 
the company is unable to predict what changes will be made in the reimbursement methods utilized by third party health care payors 
in addition  hospitals and other health care providers have become increasingly price competitive and  in some instances  have put pressure on medical suppliers to lower their prices 
any reductions in coverage or price limitations by third party payors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
product liability 
the medical supply and device industry has been historically litigious and the company faces an inherent business risk of financial exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of its products results in personal injury 
since the company s principal products are designed to be used in connection with medical procedures on the human body  manufacturing errors or design defects could result in an unsafe condition  injury or death to the patient  and could result in a recall of the company s products and substantial monetary damages 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience losses due to product liability claims in the future 
although the company currently maintains liability insurance  there can be no assurance that the coverage limits of the company s insurance policies will be adequate 
such insurance is expensive  difficult to obtain  and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms  or at all 
any claims against the company  regardless of their merit or eventual outcome  could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business financial condition  and results of operations 
acquisition of customers by competitors of the company 
a significant percentage of dialysis treatment centers nationwide are owned by competitors of the company 
accordingly  the company may face difficulty in selling its dialysis products to these centers 
additionally  a competitor has recently acquired a number of companies that provide contract perfusion services to hospitals 
although the company believes that it is too early to assess the long term effects of these acquisitions on its business  the company may face difficulty in selling its cardiosurgery products to perfusionists employed by these companies or to hospitals or clinics that contract with them 
these acquisitions or other acquisitions by the company s competitors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
dependence on distributor sales 
sales to distributors constitute a significant portion of the company s business both in the us and foreign markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its relationship with distributors  or  if these relationships terminate  that new distributors will be found 
the loss of a significant distributor could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations if a new distributor or other suitable sales organization could not be found on a timely basis 
interruption in sources of supply 
the fiber used in the company s oxygenators is purchased from a single source 
if this source of supply becomes unavailable  then there can be no assurance that the company would be able to find an acceptable substitute supplier 
in addition  high demand for polycarbonate products by various industries has at times caused temporary shortages of their supply 
any significant interruption in the supply of these products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
environmental compliance 
in the ordinary course of its manufacturing process  the company uses various chemical solvents and other regulated substances 
although the company is not aware of any claim involving violation of environmental or occupational health and safety laws or regulations  there can be no assurance that such a claim may not arise in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
currency risk 
approximately percent of the company s business is transacted in foreign markets 
long term changes or short term fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
dependence on significant customers 
the company s five largest customers in fiscal accounted for percent of its total sales 
the loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the company s oxygenator supply contract with bard ended june  although the company plans to supplant the lost revenues from bard under this contract with sales of its recently introduced biocor tm oxygenator  there can be no assurance that these plans will be realized 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s success depends in large part on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific  technical  management  and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the development and operation of its business 
the loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
possible volatility of share price 
market prices for securities of medical technology companies are highly volatile and the trading price of the company s common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations by the company or its competitors  government regulation  and other events or factors  including the various risk actors discussed herein 
in addition  market prices of securities of medical technology companies have from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
anti takeover considerations 
the board of directors of the company has the authority  without any action by the shareholders  to fix the rights and preferences of any shares of the company s preferred stock to be issued from time to time 
in addition  as a minnesota corporation  the company is subject to certain anti takeover provisions of the minnesota business corporation act the mbca 
the authority of the board with regard to the preferred stock and the provisions of the mbca could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company  may discourage bids for the company s common stock at a premium over the then prevailing market price of the common stock  and may adversely effect the market price of  and the voting and other rights of the holders of  common stock 
volatility of global markets 
the company and its subsidiary operate in a global market 
global operations are subject to risks  including political and economic instability  general economic conditions  imposition of government controls  fluctuations of exchange rates  the need to comply with a wide variety of foreign and united states export laws  trade restrictions and the greater difficulty of administering business overseas 
although substantially all of the company s direct international sales are denominated in united states dollars  both direct sales by the company and sales through its affiliated international distributors may be affected by these factors and thus may adversely affect the operations and financial results of the company 
year issues 
certain of the company s information systems and products may require updating to continue to function properly beyond the company believes that adequate resources have been allocated for this purpose and does not expect to incur significant expenditures to address this issue 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will identify all year compliance issues in its information systems and products in advance of their occurrence or that the company will be able to remedy successfully any problems that are discovered 
the expenses of the company s efforts to address such problems  or the expenses or liabilities to which the company may become subject as a result of such problems  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations  in addition  the revenue stream and financial stability of existing customers may be adversely impacted by year compliance problems  which could cause fluctuations in the company s revenue and operating results
