item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes forward looking statements that reflect the company s current views with respect to future matters such as revenue sources  levels and growth  spending levels  international operations  gross profit and capital needs 
actual results may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences in results and outcomes include without limitation those discussed below as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report 
overview the company develops  markets and supports self service software products that enable organizations to deploy automated services accessed by customers and employees via the internet  corporate intranets and the telephone 
the company commenced operations in may to address the issues facing organizations needing to provide more and better service through a broad range of interactive media while containing costs 
the company was engaged principally in research and development through the first quarter of  when it made its initial product shipments of its principal product  electronic workforce 
since that time  the company has released new versions of electronic workforce at least annually 
the company derives revenues from licenses of its software products and fees for services related thereto 
the company currently markets electronic workforce across multiple industries  emphasizing customer self service applications within the financial services industry and employee self service applications deployed by human resources organizations 
in addition  in the last two years  the company has introduced two software application products for web based self service applications in the financial services and human resources markets  the electronic banking system and the employee service system  both of which are built on electronic workforce and incorporate web  java and other technologies which address the customization requirements necessary for the application products market 
the company began shipping ebs in september and began shipping esy in june the company markets its products through its own field sales force  as well as through vars and oems  and markets its services directly to its customers and distribution partners 
the typical size of a direct transaction including software licenses and services ranges from  to  and can be over  for large applications 
most indirect licenses are smaller and do not include a service component  resulting in substantially lower revenues per transaction to the company 
in  the company derived approximately of its revenues from software licenses and from fees for services 
the company generally recognizes revenue from the licensing of software products upon shipment and revenue from service contracts ratably over the contract period or as the services are performed 
as of december   the company had an accumulated deficit of million 
the company intends to make ongoing investments in its sales  marketing  research and development  customer support and administrative infrastructure over the near term 
operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties  and there can be no assurance that the company will sustain profitability on an annual or quarterly basis 
the company s prospects must be considered in light of the risks encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
although the company has experienced significant percentage growth in revenues  it does not believe that prior percentage growth rates are sustainable or indicative of future growth 
the ability of the company to achieve revenue growth and profitability in the future will depend on a number of factors  many of which are outside of the company s control 
in particular  growth and profitability will depend on the company s success in marketing versions of and developing enhancements to its products that run on the windows nt platform as well as the company s success in marketing its new application products 
the company s inability to implement these key elements of its growth strategy would result in a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth  as a percentage of total net revenues  statement of operations data for the periods indicated year ended december  net revenues license services and other total net revenues cost of license revenues cost of services and other revenues gross profit operating expenses product development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income interest expense interest  net income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss net revenues total net revenues were million  million  and million in   and  respectively  representing increases of from to and from to the company s revenues are principally derived from software licenses and fees for services  which are generally charged separately 
revenues are recorded net of reserves for potential product returns  neither of which have been significant to date 
no single customer exceeded of total net revenues in  or in each of  and  or less of the company s total net revenues were derived from international sales 
over time  the company intends to expand its operations outside the united states and enter additional international markets 
international operations entail a number of risks including those associated with product customization and regulatory compliance  and there can be no assurance that such expansion will be successful 
license revenues 
revenues from licenses were million  million and million in   and  respectively  representing increases of from to and from to the increases in license revenues from to were attributable to several factors  including an increase in unit volume as a result of the market s growing awareness and acceptance of electronic workforce  the addition of web capabilities to this product in the fourth quarter of  the introduction of the electronic banking system in september  the introduction of the employee service system in june  and expansion of the company s field sales force and indirect distribution channels 
the prices of the company s electronic workforce licenses have remained relatively constant from to the company does not believe that the historical growth rates of license revenues will be sustainable or are indicative of future results 
services and other revenues 
services and other revenues consist primarily of fees from consulting  post contract customer support and  to a lesser extent  training and installation services 
services and other revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing increases of from to and from to services and other revenues increased as a percentage of total net revenues to in from in and in these increases in services and other revenues occurred primarily due to increased demand for consulting services  as well as increases in post contract customer support  training and installation services associated with the increased volume of licenses of the company s software 
consulting services primarily are contracted for under time and material arrangements 
the company does not expect historical growth rates of its services revenues to be sustainable in the future 
to the extent services and other revenues increases as a percentage of total net revenues  overall gross profit margins may be adversely impacted 
cost of revenues cost of license revenues 
cost of license revenues consists primarily of the cost of product media  product duplication  documentation and royalties paid to third parties under technology licenses 
cost of license revenues was   and  in  and  respectively  representing  and of the related license revenues for the respective years 
the increase in the dollar amount and the cost of license revenues as a percentage of license revenues from to was due to increases in shipments of the company s software products and the costs of third party technology used for a particular customer 
the decrease in the dollar amount from to was due primarily to decreased overhead costs 
the decrease in cost of license revenues as a percentage of license revenues from to was due to increased license revenues coupled with decreased material and overhead costs 
if the company were required to obtain licenses from third parties under patent or other intellectual property rights  the cost of license revenues could increase significantly 
cost of services and other revenues 
cost of services and other revenues consists primarily of personnel related costs and fees for third party consultants incurred in providing consulting  post contract customer support  training and installation services to customers 
cost of services and other revenues was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and of the related services and other revenues for the respective years 
the increases in absolute dollars were due primarily to increases in personnel related costs as the company continued to expand its consulting  customer support  training and installation services organizations 
the cost of services and other revenues as a percentage may vary between periods due to the mix of services provided by the company and to varying levels of expenditures required to build the services organizations 
any significant decline in the demand for the company s consulting services would have a material adverse impact on the company s revenues and  as a result of the under utilization of consulting personnel  on the company s gross profit and results of operations 
operating expenses product development 
product development expenses were million  million and million  or  and of total net revenues  in  and  respectively 
product development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related expenses for research and development personnel  as well as the cost of facilities and depreciation of capital equipment 
the increases in absolute dollars from to  as well as the increase in product development expenses as a percentage of total net revenues from to  were attributable primarily to increased staffing related to development of application products  the development of versions of electronic workforce to run on windows nt and ongoing enhancements to electronic workforce 
the company believes that significant investments in product development are required to remain competitive 
as a result  the company expects that product development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in the future and will not decline significantly as a percentage of total net revenues from their current levels 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the company expects to capitalize eligible computer software development costs upon the achievement of technological feasibility  subject to net realizable value considerations 
the company has defined technological feasibility as completion of a working model 
to date  the company believes its process for developing software was essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility  and  accordingly  no software development costs have been capitalized in the accompanying statements of operations 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million  or  and of total net revenues  in  and  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions earned by sales and marketing personnel and promotional expenses 
the increases in absolute dollars in sales and marketing expenses for and were due primarily to the expansion of the company s field and indirect sales operations and increased marketing activities 
the reductions in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total net revenues were due primarily to the growth in total net revenues 
the company expects to continue to expand its field sales and marketing efforts  its third party var distribution channel and its operations outside the united states and  therefore  anticipates that sales and marketing expenditures will increase in absolute dollars in the future 
in addition  sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total net revenues may fluctuate between periods due to varying levels of expenditures to build the sales and marketing organizations 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million  or  and of total net revenues  in  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related expenses of administrative  executive and financial personnel and outside professional fees 
the increases in absolute dollars from to were attributable primarily to the addition of staff  increased costs associated with expansion of information systems to support the growth of the company s business and increased costs to take on the additional responsibilities associated with being a public company 
the reduction in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues from to was due primarily to the growth in total net revenues 
the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues from to was due primarily to the aforementioned factors 
the company expects to continue to expand its staffing  information systems and other items related to infrastructure and  therefore  anticipates that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in the future 
interest interest income 
interest income was million  million and  in  and  respectively 
the increases from to were due primarily to increases in average investment balances from the proceeds of the company s initial public offering 
interest expense 
interest expense  which relates primarily to capital lease obligations  was   and  in  and  respectively 
the increases from to were due primarily to an increase in property and equipment acquired under capital lease obligations 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was   and  in  and  respectively 
no provision for federal income taxes was required through  as the company had not been profitable on an annual basis from its inception through as of december   the company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
the net operating loss carryforwards expire in years through as of december   the company also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately  and  respectively 
the company s accounting for deferred taxes under statement of financial accounting standards no 
involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of the company s deferred tax assets 
to support the company s conclusion that a valuation allowance was required  management primarily considered such factors as the company s history of operating losses  the nature of the company s deferred tax assets  the lack of significant firm sales backlog  no significant excess of appreciated asset value over the tax basis of the company s net assets and the absence of taxable income in prior carryback years 
although management s operating plans assume taxable and operating income in future periods  management s evaluation of all the available evidence in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets indicates that such plans are not considered sufficient to overcome the available negative evidence 
liquidity and capital resources from inception through april  the company financed its operations and met its capital expenditure requirements primarily through private sales of preferred stock  totaling million 
on may   the company completed its initial public offering of  shares of its common stock at a price of per share 
proceeds to the company from this offering were approximately million  net of underwriting discounts and other offering costs 
at december   the company s cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments totaled million 
at december   the company also had available an million unsecured revolving bank line of credit agreement which expires in december and contains certain financial covenants  with which the company was in compliance 
borrowings accrue interest at the bank s prime rate 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit 
in   of cash was provided by operating activities  resulting primarily from net income  depreciation and amortization and increases in accrued expenses and unearned revenue  offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to an increase in revenues and average days sales outstanding 
in  million of cash was provided by operating activities  resulting primarily from depreciation and amortization and increases in accrued expenses and unearned revenue  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
in  million of cash was used in operating activities  resulting primarily from increases in accounts receivable associated with the increases in revenues  partially offset by increases in accrued expenses and unearned revenue 
in  and  the company s investing activities have consisted primarily of purchases and sales of short term investments and purchases of property and capital equipment 
capital expenditures  including equipment acquired under capital leases  were million  million and million in  and  respectively  primarily for expansion of the company s facilities and purchases of computer and network equipment for the company s growing employee base 
the company expects that its capital expenditures will increase as the company s employee base grows 
the company s principal commitments consist primarily of leases on its headquarters facilities and its equipment 
in  net cash generated from financing activities of million was related primarily to proceeds from the issuance of the company s common stock through its employee stock purchase plan and stock option exercises 
at december   the company s working capital was million 
in  the company expects to incur costs in excess of  associated with the implementation of a new financial system to replace its current system 
the company has no other significant capital spending or purchase commitments other than normal purchase commitments and commitments under facilities and capital leases 
the company believes that its working capital  together with its bank line of credit and anticipated cash flows from operations  if any  will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
business risks this section on business risks includes forward looking statements that reflect the company s current views with respect to future matters such as factors that can affect the company s operating results  technological change  the markets for the company s products  the company s sales channels and the stability and availability of compatible technology 
this section also contains cautionary statements that identify important factors  including certain risks and uncertainties  that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements in this section and elsewhere in this report 
potential fluctuations in operating results 
the company s revenues  margins and operating results have fluctuated in the past  and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future  on an annual and quarterly basis as a result of a number of factors  such as demand for the company s products  including new products and product enhancements  the mix of products and services sold  the mix of distribution channels through which the company s products are sold  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products or product enhancements  purchasing patterns of value added resellers and customers  company decisions regarding hiring and other expenses and competitive conditions in the industry 
in particular  the company plans to increase its operating expenses to expand its sales and marketing operations  expand its distribution channels  expand its international operations  fund greater levels of product development  broaden its consulting services and customer support capabilities and increase its administrative infrastructure 
a relatively high percentage of the company s expenses is fixed in the short term as the company s expense levels are based  in part  on its expectations as to future revenues 
if revenues fall below expectations  expenditure levels could be disproportionately high as a percentage of total net revenues  and operating results would be immediately and adversely affected 
the company historically has operated with little backlog because its products are generally shipped as orders are received 
as a result  license revenues in any quarter depend on the volume and timing of  and the company s ability to fill  orders received in that quarter 
individual orders for the company s products typically are for relatively large dollar amounts 
the company also believes the purchase of its products is relatively discretionary and generally involves a significant commitment of capital resources 
therefore  any downturn in any potential customer s business  or any loss or delay of individual orders for any reason  would have a significant impact on the company s revenues and quarterly results 
in addition  because the company typically recognizes a substantial portion of its total revenue from transactions booked and shipped in the last weeks  or even days  of the quarter  the magnitude of quarterly fluctuations may not become evident until very late in a particular quarter 
revenues are difficult to forecast because the market for the company s products is rapidly evolving 
the company s sales cycle  including initial order  provision of services and follow on sales  averages six months  but varies substantially from customer to customer and can range from one month to over one year from initial contact 
furthermore  the company expects that sales derived through indirect channels  which are harder to predict and may have lower margins than direct sales  will increase as a percentage of total net revenues 
in addition  as a result of recently issued guidance on software revenue recognition  license agreements entered into during a quarter may not meet the company s revenue recognition criteria 
therefore  even if the company meets or exceeds its forecast of aggregate licensing and other contracting activity  it is possible that the company s revenues would not meet expectations 
although the company s revenue growth has made it difficult to determine whether the company s business has been subject to seasonal variations  the company believes that some of its customers tend to make product purchase decisions in the fourth quarter as a result of purchase cycles related to expiration of budgetary authorizations 
based upon all of the foregoing  the company believes that its quarterly revenues  expenses and operating results could vary significantly in the future  and that period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
the company may also choose to reduce prices or increase spending in response to competition or to pursue new market opportunities 
if new competitors  technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require the company to invest significantly greater resources in research and development efforts  the company s operating results in the future may be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to grow in future periods or that it will be able to sustain its level of total revenues or its rate of revenue growth on a quarterly or annual basis 
it is likely that  in some future quarters  the company s operating results will be below the expectations of stock market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock could be materially adversely affected 
risks of expansion to windows nt operating system 
the company s future success will depend on its ability to design  develop  test  sell and support new software products and enhancements of current products on a timely basis in response to changing customer needs  competition  technological developments and emerging industry standards 
versions through x of electronic workforce and x of ebs and esy run on ibm s os operating system 
in october  the company released its first version of electronic workforce release for the windows nt operating system 
in december  the company released initial versions of ebs and esy for nt 
because these products have been recently released  many customers licensing these versions have not yet fully deployed the product and undetected errors may remain in these versions 
the existence of any such errors may delay the release of future versions and adversely affect the acceptance of these products  either of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  certain features of the os versions of the company s software are not available on currently available nt based versions 
accordingly  the company is devoting significant engineering and development resources to develop enhancements to the versions of its products that run on the microsoft windows nt operating system 
it is possible that the newness of or lack of features on the windows nt based versions of its products will cause potential customers to defer or forgo purchases of current or future versions of these products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s future success will depend upon the timely and successful introduction of new versions of its windows nt based products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing  on a timely basis or at all  fully featured windows nt based versions of its products or that such versions  if developed  will achieve customer acceptance 
failure by the company to develop new windows nt based versions successfully and in a timely manner would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company intends to invest a significant majority of its product development resources on products and product enhancements for the windows nt operating system 
the company must manage the effect on its existing os customers of this focus on the windows nt operating system 
there can be no assurance that updates to and enhancements for the company s os based products will be sufficient to encourage its os customers to continue to purchase additional software or services from the company 
in addition  the company must provide its customers with an economically reasonable and technologically feasible migration path from the os based products to the nt based products 
there can be no assurance that the company s os customers will migrate to the company s nt based products 
the failure of a significant number of its existing os customers to purchase additional software or services from the company  for any reason  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
emerging market  unproven acceptance of the company s application products 
certain of the company s products and features have been introduced only recently 
in september  the company began shipping the electronic banking system  its first application product 
in june  edify began shipping its employee service system 
the emerging self service application products markets are rapidly changing and are characterized by an increasing number of new entrants whose products compete with those of the company 
demand for and market acceptance of these products and services are subject to a high level of uncertainty 
moreover  much of the industry software and infrastructure supporting the use of the company s products in these markets is new and unproven 
it is difficult to predict with any assurance whether the web will prove to be a viable commercial marketplace  or whether demand for web or intranet related products and services will increase in the future 
in addition  portions of the markets for the company s products and services are new and evolving  and it is difficult to predict the future growth of this market 
there can be no assurance that a viable market for self service application products will develop or be sustainable 
if the market fails to develop  develops more slowly than expected or becomes saturated with competitors  or if the company s products and services do not achieve or sustain market acceptance  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
lengthy sales cycle 
the licensing of edify s software is often an enterprise wide decision by prospective customers and generally requires the company to engage in a lengthy sales cycle and to provide a significant level of education to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of its software 
due in part to the mission critical nature of certain of the company s software applications and the associated hardware  software and consulting expenditures  potential customers tend to be cautious in making product acquisition decisions 
in addition  the licensing of the company s software involves a significant commitment of capital and the attendant delays frequently associated with approving large capital expenditures and reviewing new technologies that affect key operations 
for these and other reasons  the sales cycle for the company s products can range from one month to over one year  averages six months  and is subject to a number of significant risks  including customers budgetary constraints and internal acceptance reviews  over which the company has little or no control 
consequently  if sales forecasted from a specific customer for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter  the company is unlikely to be able to generate revenue from alternate sources in time to compensate for the shortfall 
as a result  and due to the relatively large size of a typical order  a lost or delayed sale could have a material adverse effect on the company s quarterly operating results 
moreover  to the extent that significant sales occur earlier than expected  operating results for subsequent quarters may be adversely affected 
dependence upon development of marketing channels 
an integral part of the company s strategy is to develop multiple distribution channels  including a field sales force  vars and oems 
the company intends to increase its reliance on third party distribution partners in the future 
the company is expending and intends to continue to expend significant resources to develop the var channel 
vars are not  however  subject to any minimum purchase or resale requirements and can cease marketing the company s products at any time 
certain vars also offer competing products that they produce or that are produced by third parties 
there can be no assurance that the company s existing vars will continue to provide the level of services and technical support necessary to provide a complete self service solution to the company s customers or that they will not emphasize their own or third party products to the detriment of the company s products 
the loss of vars  the failure of such parties to perform under agreements with the company  or the inability of the company to attract and retain new vars with the technical  industry and application expertise required to market the company s products successfully in the future could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
to the extent that the company is successful in increasing its sales through vars  those sales will be at discounted rates  and revenue to the company for each such sale will be less than if the company had licensed the same products to the customer directly 
the company plans to expand its field sales force and its marketing organization 
the company s future success depends upon the increased productivity of its existing field sales force and the ability of the company to integrate and train new sales personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company s efforts will be successful  that the cost of such efforts will not exceed the revenue generated  or that the company s sales and marketing organization will be able to compete successfully against the significantly more extensive and well funded sales and marketing operations of many of the company s current or potential competitors 
the company s inability to manage its internal expansion effectively could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
management of a rapidly changing business 
the rapid development of an infrastructure necessary for the company to exploit the market opportunities for its products requires an effective planning and management process 
the company has recently experienced changes in its operations that have placed significant demands on the company s administrative  operational and financial resources 
in  the company increased its staff from to employees and its total net revenues by 
the company is expanding its sales and marketing organizations  developing its distribution channels to penetrate different and broader markets  funding increasing levels of research and development  and growing its support organization to accommodate the increasing installed base of products 
the growth in the company s customer base has placed  and any future growth is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on the company s management and operations  including its sales  customer support  research and development  finance and administrative operations 
the company s officers as a whole have had limited experience in managing large or rapidly growing business organizations 
the company s ability to compete effectively and its future growth  if any  will require the company to continually improve its financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures on a timely basis  implement new systems as necessary  and expand  train and manage its employee workforce 
there can be no assurance that the company s controls  systems or procedures will be adequate to support the company s operations 
the failure of the company s management to respond effectively to changing business conditions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on key personnel  need for additional personnel 
the company s future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of members of the company s senior management and other key research and development  sales and marketing personnel 
the company currently has open positions for vice president of sales and vice president of engineering 
the failure of the company to fill these positions with qualified persons in a timely fashion  or the loss of any other key persons  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company does not have employment agreements with any of its key personnel 
in addition  the company believes that its future success will depend upon its continuing ability to identify  attract  train and retain other highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales and marketing and professional services personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting  assimilating and retaining the necessary personnel  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
reliance on stability and availability of third party software and hardware 
the company s products involve integration with products and systems developed by third parties 
substantially all of the company s installed base of products run on the os operating system  and the company is therefore dependent upon the continued viability of the os operating system and upon ibm s continuing support for the os operating system 
in the fourth quarter of  the company released windows nt based versions of its products and intends to focus future product development efforts on nt 
accordingly  the company also is dependent upon the continued viability of that operating environment 
in addition  the current versions of the company s products are designed to function only with natural microsystems corporation s voice hardware cards and software drivers and intersolv inc s qelib for database connectivity 
if any of these third party products should become unavailable for any reason  fail under operation with the company s products  or fail to be supported by their respective vendors  it would be necessary for the company to redesign its products 
there can be no assurance that any redesign could be accomplished in a cost effective or timely manner 
the company or its customers could also experience difficulties integrating the company s products with other hardware and software 
furthermore  should new releases of these operating systems  voice hardware cards and software drivers or database connectivity software occur before the company develops products compatible with such new releases  any resulting decline in demand for the company s products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
year compliance 
many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept two digit entries in the date code field 
these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  in less than two years  computer systems and software used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
although the company s products are year compliant  the company believes that the purchasing patterns of customers and potential customers may be affected by year issues as companies expend significant resources to correct or patch their current software systems for year compliance 
these expenditures may result in reduced funds available to purchase software products such as those offered by the company  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  even if the company s products are year compliant  other systems or software used by the company s customers may not be year compliant 
the failure of such noncompliant third party software or systems could affect the perceived performance of the company s products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the company is in the process of identifying operating and application software challenges related to the year while the company expects to resolve year compliance issues substantially through normal replacement and upgrades of software  there can be no assurance that there will not be interruption of operations or other limitations of system functionality or that the company will not incur substantial costs to avoid such limitations 
any failure to effectively monitor  implement or improve the company s operational  financial  management and technical support systems could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
implementation of new financial system 
the company has decided to replace its existing financial system as part of its ongoing effort to increase operational efficiency 
the failure of the company to implement successfully the new system and to manage effectively the transition from its current system to the new system could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations
