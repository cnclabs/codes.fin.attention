item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general demand for corrugated containers  containerboard and unbleached kraft paper is cyclical and has historically corresponded to changes in the rate of growth in the us economy and exchange rates for the us dollar 
growth in the us economy generally stimulates demand for packaging products 
in addition  weakness of the us dollar versus the currencies of the united states major trading partners stimulates domestic demand for corrugated products and makes export sales of containerboard more price competitive 
the cyclical nature of demand is accentuated by the inelasticity of supply  due to the capital intensive nature of the industry 
because productive capacity cannot be added quickly  containerboard and unbleached kraft paper inventory levels tend to fall during periods of rising demand  exerting upward pressure on prices 
in periods when capacity exceeds demand  efforts to control inventory levels can be viewed as limited  because containerboard and unbleached kraft paper mills operate most economically near capacity operating levels 
demand for unbleached kraft paper has declined in recent years due to displacement by plastics 
the company can vary its production of unbleached kraft paper  depending on market conditions  because all four of the company s paper machines that produce unbleached kraft paper also have the capability to produce containerboard 
from the fall of through the fall of  published linerboard and grocery sack paper transaction prices declined approximately percent and percent  respectively 
published industry prices for linerboard and grocery sack paper recovered significantly throughout fiscal and fiscal  increasing approximately percent and percent  respectively  and reaching record highs 
increases in industry containerboard capacity and softening demand for corrugated containers contributed to an approximately percent decrease in published prices for linerboard between september and september between september and june  published industry prices for linerboard decreased an additional percent before recovering in the fourth quarter of fiscal at september  published prices for linerboard were approximately percent higher than june levels 
november published industry prices for linerboard have decreased approximately percent from september levels 
results of operations year ended september  fiscal compared with year ended september  fiscal

average selling prices for the company s domestic linerboard  export linerboard and corrugated products increased approximately percent  percent and percent  respectively  in fiscal over fiscal average selling prices increased approximately percent for unbleached kraft paper and percent for multiwall bags compared to the prior year 
higher volumes of corrugated products shipped in fiscal increased sales by approximately million compared to fiscal corrugated shipments increased approximately percent in fiscal to billion square feet compared to billion square feet in fiscal  primarily due to the start up of a new sheet feeder facility in the first quarter of fiscal multiwall bag shipments increased approximately percent to thousand tons in fiscal compared to thousand tons in the prior year 
total mill production decreased to  tons per day tpd  calculated on the basis of the number of days in the period in fiscal compared to  tpd in fiscal containerboard production was essentially flat with  tpd in fiscal compared with  tpd in the prior year

gross margin increased to million from million in the prior year 
gross margin was favorably impacted by higher volume million and higher average selling prices million for the company s products 
the favorable impact was reduced somewhat by higher fiber costs million and incremental fixed costs associated with the start up of the new sheet feeder facility million 
increased fiber costs are primarily due to higher prices for wood chips with an average delivered cost increase of approximately percent in fiscal compared to the prior year

over the last five years  the company has focused its capital plan on upgrading and expanding its corrugated container  sheet feeder and multiwall bag plants 
the goal of this capital plan is to increase capacity and achieve quality enhancements and cost efficiencies 
for fiscal  capital spending is not expected to exceed million  while capital spending beyond fiscal is expected to approximate the company s annual depreciation expense 
capital spending will  however  be adjusted from time to time as market conditions and available cash flows dictate 
at the end of fiscal  the company determined it would be unlikely that its antioch  california unbleached kraft paper mill the east mill  which was closed in fiscal  could be sold as a mill site or that the east mill  or a portion thereof  could be operated economically by the company 
in fiscal  the company increased its demolition efforts and incurred approximately million of costs for demolition and asbestos removal and to maintain the east mill 
such costs were net of proceeds from the sale of scrap

strengthening industry fundamentals  including year over year growth in corrugated product shipments and strong export demand for linerboard  resulted in a per ton increase in published industry prices for containerboard in october and subsequent increases in converted product prices 
however  published prices of containerboard have since declined approximately per ton 
average wood chip prices in fiscal increased approximately percent as a result of higher demand and unusually wet weather in the southern us by the end of fiscal  however  wood chips had returned to prior year levels 
average delivered prices for occ decreased approximately per ton  or approximately percent from per ton in fiscal the fiber market is difficult to predict and there can be no assurance of the future direction of occ and wood chip prices

year readiness disclosure the year issue refers generally to the potential problems that software and processing systems could encounter in determining the correct century for the year 
software and processing systems with date sensitive functions that are not year compliant may not be able to distinguish whether means or  which may result in system failures or the creation of erroneous results 
the company has developed a comprehensive phased year readiness plan to address its internal systems that are comprised of both information technology it and non it systems 
the company s it and non it systems are comprised of computers and application software for financial and business management  electronic data interchange  process control and equipment monitoring  telecommunications  and environmental controls 
the plan includes development of corporate awareness  assessment  implementation including remediation  upgrade  replacement  and deployment of certain products  validation testing  and contingency planning 
the company believes that  by modifying or upgrading existing systems  and or converting to new systems  the year issue can be resolved without material operational difficulties 
based on current estimates  the company expects to spend approximately million through fiscal to correct the year issue  of which approximately million has been incurred through fiscal the company plans to fund its year effort with cash from operations and borrowings under its revolving credit agreements 
the company has largely completed the awareness and assessment portion of its year readiness plan 
remediation and implementation activities for business critical items are proceeding and are scheduled to be completed by mid verification testing will continue through the remainder of it systems are being verified for accuracy across the year boundary as well as other special calendar date situations 
a national consulting firm specializing in year issues assisted the company throughout the planning process and has been retained to assist in the year verification testing 
the testing approach employed is intended to identify all potential problems with processing the year it is impractical to assure that all potential problems will be identified during these testing procedures 
therefore  the company may experience a greater than normal need for support activities immediately following the change in the millennium 
the it staff  with the assistance of designated outside vendor support  is prepared to react and correct these problems in a timely fashion  as it does with problems that occur in the normal course of business 
a consulting firm specializing in industrial controls has been retained to develop an equipment inventory and to assist in the validation of equipment compliance for certain non it systems at the company s paper mills 
at its other facilities  internal resources  both operational and it staff  are being used to inventory and to assist in the validation of the non it systems 
the company believes that many of its customers  suppliers and financial institutions are also impacted by the year issue  which could affect the company 
the company is therefore conducting an assessment of the compliance efforts of the company s critical customers  suppliers and financial institutions 
at this time  the company is unable to determine the impact of these third party compliance efforts 
if the company s current or future customer or suppliers  however  fail to achieve year compliance  the company believes that due to lack of concentration of major customers or critical suppliers results of operations  financial position or cash flow should not be materially adversely affected 
the company has projected that the most likely worst case year scenario would be the result of unidentified year issues  which could result in unplanned downtime at a rate higher than is normally experienced 
contingency plans are currently being developed and are expected to be completed by mid to respond to the likelihood of these higher than normal system incidents 
any system failure which results in a business disruption is expected to be handled in a timely fashion  as would normal day to day failures 
these potential disruptions should not result in a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flow

all forward looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the projected results 
factors that may cause these differences include  but are not limited to  the availability of qualified personnel and other information technology resources  the ability to identify and remediate all date sensitive lines of computer code or to replace embedded computer chips in affected systems or equipment  and the actions and ability of third party suppliers and customers to successfully eliminate their year problems
