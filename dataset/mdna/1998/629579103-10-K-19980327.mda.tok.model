in accordance with this plan  nmhg recognized special charges of million 
the planned restructuring activities  which the company began to implement in december  include the relocation and consolidation of certain engineering and marketing functions with the objective of improving customer service  raising productivity and thereby reducing costs 
the consolidated statements of income include a restructuring charge  which was recorded in the fourth quarter of  of million million after effective tax provision  or per share and represents an accrual for employee severance costs and costs to terminate certain facility leases 
in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income include a charge of million million after effective tax provision  or per share arising from commitments to provide relocation benefits to certain employees 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these special charges

the decrease in revenues can be attributed to a decline in worldwide unit volume from  units in to  units in unit volume declined significantly during the first quarter of as compared with the first quarter of  while unit volume during the last nine months of was comparable to the same period of the decrease in unit volume in the first quarter of was driven by decreased demand for forklift trucks during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  resulting in a decline in production rates  especially during the first quarter of in addition to the decrease in unit volume  a slight decline in the european market size  coupled with adverse currency impacts on pricing  contributed to nmhg s decline in revenue 
a decrease in the asia pacific market size and a decline in nmhg s market share in that region due to intense competition also contributed to the drop in revenue 
although revenues declined in  worldwide backlog increased to  units at december  from  units at december  the strengthening of the british pound sterling during had an adverse impact on nmhg s revenues  operating profit and net income 
this impact on operating profit and net income was partially offset  however  by significant savings from material purchases denominated in japanese yen  which weakened against the us dollar

continued financial review continued excluding the effects of the restructuring charge  the employee relocation provision and the tax adjustments discussed previously  operating profit and net income increased as compared with this increase primarily resulted from improved manufacturing efficiencies  savings from process re engineering  gains from strategic supplier alliances  favorable sales mix and increased parts sales 
in addition  net income increased due to lower interest expense as a result of reduced borrowings  reflecting strong operating cash flows and the impact of the sale of certain accounts receivable

this decline was partially offset by increased volume in europe of percent to  units and in asia pacific of percent to  units 
late and mid acquisitions of european warehouse equipment businesses principally contributed to the unit growth in europe 
product sales mix favorably impacted revenues due to increased sales of higher value product 
intensified pricing pressures in the americas due to decreased industry demand  slightly offset by price increases implemented in europe  caused the unfavorable pricing impact 
the improvement in service parts  concentrated in the americas  resulted from nmhg s increasing lift truck population 
operating profit was positively affected by currency as the strength of the us dollar against the japanese yen reduced the cost of japanese sourced goods 
manufacturing costs increased due to lower plant utilization and labor inefficiencies resulting from the decline in market demand and due to increased warranty and inventory reserves 
higher marketing costs expended to generate sales volume and operating expenses of recently acquired businesses also contributed to the decline in operating profit and net income

capital for these expenditures has been and is expected to be provided primarily by internally generated funds and short term borrowings 
in the second quarter of  nmhg entered into an agreement with a financial institution to sell an undivided percentage ownership interest in certain eligible domestic accounts receivable  on a revolving basis  up to a maximum of million 
the expiration date of this agreement  which is currently april  may be extended for one year periods through april  upon the mutual consent of both parties

these items are partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable  a million addition to net current deferred tax assets and a million decrease in net non current deferred tax liabilities 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents results from the repayment of million of debt  the expenditure of million for capital improvements and a business acquisition and the payment of a million dividend to stockholders  partially offset by cash generated from operations of million 
the decline in inventory reflects a reduction in the number of days supply on hand and the increase in accounts payable reflects an increase in the volume of inventory purchases 
other current liabilities have increased primarily due to the restructuring and employee relocation reserves  an increase in accrued warranty obligations and an increase in other employee wage and benefit accruals 
the change in accounts receivable reflects an increase in the volume of fourth quarter sales as compared with and a reduction in the amount of receivables sold 
the increase in net current deferred tax assets relates to provisions for increased accruals and reserves  including the restructuring and employee relocation reserves 
the net non current deferred tax liability decreased due to the reversal of the reserve for unremitted foreign earnings  as previously discussed

increased volume from million units in to million units in resulted from increased sales of toasters  blenders  hand mixers and irons  partially offset by decreased sales of toaster ovens  roasters and can openers 
these volume increases were largely driven by increased sales to key mass merchants and resulted in improved market share 
the increase in operating profit and net income resulting from this volume growth was almost entirely offset by price decreases primarily on irons  toasters  coffeemakers and indoor grills  which were necessary to compete with chinese imports 
also contributing to the decline in net income were higher employee costs  start up costs of the saltillo facility  expenses to reduce manufacturing activities in the united states and increased interest expense due to higher average debt levels

the benefit from this volume growth was somewhat offset by a decrease in the average sales price due to competition from low cost chinese imports

the reduction in materials pricing includes the favorable effect of the acquisition of plasticos sotec de mexico  sa de sa sotec  which supplies plastic parts to certain of hb ps s mexican operations
