item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations statement of operations the company accounts for its operations under generally accepted accounting principles for investment companies 
on this basis  the principal measure of its financial performance is captioned net decrease increase in net assets from operations  which is the sum of three elements 
the first element is net operating loss  which is the difference between the company s income from interest  dividends  and fees and its operating expenses  net of applicable income tax benefit 
the second element is net realized loss gain on investments  which is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio securities and their stated cost  net of applicable income tax provisions benefits 
these two elements are combined in the company s financial statements and reported as net realized loss income 
the third element  net increase decrease in unrealized appreciation on investments  is the net change in the fair value of the company s investment portfolio  net of increase decrease in deferred income taxes that would become payable if the unrealized appreciation were realized through the sale or other disposition of the investment portfolio 
net realized loss gain on investments and net increase decrease in unrealized appreciation on investments are directly related 
when a security is sold to realize a loss gain  net unrealized appreciation increases decreases and net realized gain decreases increases 
financial condition the company s total assets and net assets were  respectively   and  at december   versus  and  at december  net asset value per share was at december   versus at december  the company s shares outstanding as of december  were  versus  at december  the company s financial condition is dependent on the success of its investments 
the company has invested a substantial portion of its assets in private development stage or start up companies 
these private businesses tend to be thinly capitalized  unproven  small companies that lack management depth or have no history of operations 
at december   approximately percent of the company s million in total assets consisted of investments at fair value in private businesses  of which net unrealized appreciation was approximately million before taxes 
at december   approximately percent of the company s million in total assets consisted of investments at fair value in private businesses  of which net unrealized appreciation was approximately million 
a summary of the company s investment portfolio is as follows december  december  investments  at cost   unrealized appreciation   investments  at fair value   the accumulated unrealized appreciation on investments net of deferred taxes is  at december   versus  at december  following an initial investment in a private company  the company may make additional investments in such investee in order to increase its ownership percentage  to exercise warrants or options that were acquired in a prior financing  to preserve the company s proportionate ownership in a subsequent financing  or attempt to preserve or enhance the value of the company s investment 
such additional investments are referred to as follow on investments 
there can be no assurance that the company will make follow on investments or have sufficient funds to make additional investments 
the failure to make such follow on investments could jeopardize the viability of the investee company and the company s investment or could result in a missed opportunity for the company to participate to a greater extent in an investee s successful operations 
the company attempts to maintain adequate liquid capital to make follow on investments in its private investee portfolio companies 
the company may elect not to make a follow on investment either because it does not want to increase its concentration of risk or because it prefers other opportunities  even though the follow on investment opportunity appears attractive

therefore  a significant portion of the investment portfolio is structured to maximize the potential for capital appreciation and provides little or no current yield in the form of dividends or interest 
the company does earn interest income from fixed income securities  including us government obligations 
the amount of interest income earned varies based upon the average balance of the company s fixed income portfolio and the average yield on this portfolio 
the company had interest income of  in   in and  in the decrease is a result of a decline in the balance of the company s fixed income portfolio to pay operating expenses and to purchase non income producing private portfolio investments 
the company also received consulting and administrative fees which totaled  in   in and  in operating expenses were  in   in and  in the increase from to is primarily due to the accrual of  for the company s profit sharing plan which has not been paid out  restructuring expenses of  incurred by the company as a result of researching the conversion to ric status  both offset by a decrease in overall expenses as a result of the company s effort to cut expenses 
the increase from to is primarily owed to additional consulting fees incurred in related to prospective private portfolio investments 
most of the company s operating expenses are related to employee and director compensation  office and rent expenses and consulting and professional fees primarily legal and accounting fees 
net operating losses before taxes were  in   in and  in the company has in the past relied  and continues to rely to a large extent  upon proceeds from sales of investments  rather than investment income  to defray a significant portion of its operating expenses

recent developments the company is currently a corporation taxable under sub chapter c of the code a c corporation 
on september   the company s board of directors approved a proposal to seek qualification of the company as of january  as a ric under sub chapter m of the code 
in order to qualify as a ric  the company must  in general  annually derive at least percent of its gross income from dividends  interest and gains from the sale of securities  quarterly meet certain investment diversification requirements  and annually distribute at least percent of its investment company taxable income as a dividend 
in addition to the requirement that the company must annually distribute at least percent of its investment company taxable income  the company may either distribute or retain its taxable net capital gains from investments  but any net capital gains not distributed could be subject to corporate level tax 
further  the company could be subject to a percent excise tax and in some cases  corporate level income tax if it fails to distribute percent of its annual taxable income 
because of the specialized nature of its investment portfolio  the company can satisfy the diversification requirements under sub chapter m of the code only if it receives a certification from the sec that it is principally engaged in the furnishing of capital to other corporations which are principally engaged in the development or exploitation of inventions  technological improvements  new processes  or products not previously generally available 
in january  the company requested such a certification 
while the company believes that it is likely the sec will grant the certification  there is no guarantee that the sec in fact will take that action 
even if the certification is issued  there can be no assurance that the company will qualify as a ric or that  if it does qualify  it will continue to qualify 
in particular  continued qualification as a ric requires the company to satisfy certain portfolio diversification requirements in future years 
the company s ability to satisfy those requirements may not be controllable by the company 
the company incurred ordinary and capital losses during its c corporation taxable years that remain available for use and may be carried forward to its and subsequent taxable years 
ordinarily  a corporation that elects to qualify as a ric may not use its loss caryforwards from c corporation taxable years to offset ric investment company taxable income or net capital gains 
in addition  a corporation that elects to qualify as a ric continues to be taxable as a c corporation on any gains realized within years of its qualification as a ric from sales of assets that were held by the corporation on the effective date of the election c corporation assets to the extent of any gain built into the assets on such date built in gain 
the company has filed a private ruling request with the internal revenue service irs asking the irs to rule that the company can carry forward its c corporation losses to offset any built in gains resulting from sales of its c corporation assets  thereby enabling the company to retain some or all of the proceeds from such sales without disqualifying itself as a ric or incurring corporate level income tax 
in addition  because a ric is not permitted to have  as of the close of any ric taxable year  e p accumulated during any c corporation taxable year  the company has also requested a ruling that its sale of c corporation assets with built in gains during ric taxable years will not generate c corporation e p 
although there is no guarantee that the irs will rule favorably on the company s request for rulings  the management of the company believes that favorable rulings are likely 
the company estimates that cumulative e p as of december  were approximately million 
it intends to distribute such e p prior to december  if it receives the sec certification described above 
as of december   the company has sufficient current assets to make such distribution without jeopardizing its ability to pay its expenses as they may become due 
if necessary for liquidity purposes  in lieu of distributing its taxable net capital gains  the company may retain such net capital gains and elect to be deemed to have made a distribution of the gains  or part thereof  to the shareholders under the designated undistributed capital gain rules of section b of the code 
in such a case  the company would have to pay a percent corporate level income tax on such designated undistributed capital gain  but it would not have to distribute the excess of the retained designated undistributed capital gain over the amount of tax thereon in order to maintain its ric status 
tax consequences of net capital gains the following simplified examples illustrate the tax treatment under sub chapter m of the code for the company and its shareholders with regard to three possible alternatives  assuming a net long term capital gain of per share  consisting entirely of sales of non real property assets held for more than months 
under alternative a percent of net capital gain declared as a dividend and distributed to shareholders no taxation at the company level 
shareholders receive a per share dividend and pay a maximum tax of percent or 
per share  retaining 
per share 
under alternative b percent of net capital gain retained by the company and designated as undistributed capital gain dividend the company pays a corporate level income tax of percent on the undistributed gain or 
per share and retains percent of the gain or 
per share 
shareholders increase their cost basis in their stock by 
per share 
they pay a percent capital gains tax on percent of the undistributed gain of per share or 
per share in tax 
offsetting this tax  shareholders receive a tax credit equal to percent of the undistributed gain or 
per share 
under alternative c percent of net capital gain retained by the company  with no designated undistributed capital gain dividend the company pays a corporate level income tax of percent on the retained gain or 
per share plus an excise tax of percent of 
per share  or about 
per share 
there is no tax consequence at the shareholder level 
assumes all capital gains qualify for long term rates of percent 
risks there are significant risks inherent in the company s venture capital business 
the company has invested a substantial portion of its assets in private development stage or start up companies 
these private businesses tend to be thinly capitalized  unproven  small companies that lack management depth and have not attained profitability or have no history of operations 
because of the speculative nature and the lack of a public market for these investments  there is significantly greater risk of loss than is the case with traditional investment securities 
the company expects that some of its venture capital investments will be a complete loss or will be unprofitable and that some will appear to be likely to become successful but never realize their potential 
the company has been risk seeking rather than risk averse in its approach to venture capital and other investments 
neither the company s investments nor an investment in the company is intended to constitute a balanced investment program 
the company has in the past relied and continues to rely to a large extent upon proceeds from sales of investments rather than investment income to defray a significant portion of its operating expenses 
risks relating to the year issue the company believes that the year problem is not material to the company 
many computer software systems in use today cannot recognize the year and may revert to or some other date because of the way in which dates were encoded and calculated 
the company could be adversely affected if its computer system or those of its service providers do not properly process and calculate date related information and data on and after january  the company has been actively working on necessary changes to its computer systems to prepare for the year and intends to obtain reasonable assurances from its service providers that they are taking comparable steps with respect to their computer systems 
however  the steps the company is taking and intends to take does not guarantee complete success or eliminate the possibility that interaction with outside computer systems may have an adverse impact on the company
