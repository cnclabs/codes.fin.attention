asset liability management the company s results of operations depend substantially on its net interest income 
interest income and cost of funds are affected by general economic conditions  regulatory policy and competition in the marketplace 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the banks operating strategies focus on asset liability management 
the purpose of asset liability management alm is to provide stable net interest income growth by protecting the banks and the company s earnings from undue interest rate risk 
each of the banks follows an alm policy for controlling exposure to interest rate risk 
the alm policy is established by a committee in each bank and is reviewed  approved and administered by the asset liability committee of the company 
in order to control risk in a rising interest rate environment  management s philosophy has been to shorten the average maturity of the investment portfolio in order to achieve a more asset sensitive position  therefore allowing quicker asset repricing 
conversely  in a declining interest rate environment  the philosophy is to lengthen the average maturity of the investment portfolio  thereby becoming more liability sensitive 
the alm policy is also designed to maintain an appropriate balance between rate sensitive assets and liabilities in order to maximize interest rate spreads 
the banks monitor the sensitivity of their assets and liabilities with respect to changes in interest rates and maturities  and direct the allocation of their funds accordingly 
the strategy of each bank has been to maintain  to the extent possible  a balanced position between assets and liabilities  and to place emphasis on the sensitivity of its assets 
generally  the banks attempt to maintain liquid assets  in order to meet funding requirements in the current period  and a ratio of interest income to average earning assets of to 
at december   the net interest margins of usb  hsb  and bop were   and  respectively 
should interest rates trend upward in the near future  the company could become more asset sensitive through the sale of investment securities  although the amount realized on the sale would be adversely affected by the increased rates 
management believes there will be less movement in rates on short term liabilities such as savings  negotiable order of withdrawal now accounts and money market united security bancorporation accounts in an increasing interest rate environment than in rates on the company s interest earning assets 
the following table sets forth the company s contractual payment  maturity or repricing information for interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the resulting cumulative interest rate gap as of december  the amounts in the table are derived from internal data from the company and could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in prepayment experience  early withdrawals of deposits and competition 
mortgage backed securities  which are included with securities are estimated and based on the average lives of the underlying mortgage loans  adjusted to incorporate prepayment assumptions 
estimated maturity or repricing three months less than to less than one to over five in thousands three months one year five years years total interest earning assets fixed rate loans      floating rate loans   securities      other interest earning assets   total interest earning assets      interest bearing liabilities savings and now accounts   certificates of deposit over      other time deposits     long term debt   total interest bearing liabilities     interest sensitivity gap     cumulative interest sensitive gap     as a percentage of total assets certain assumptions are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities and periods to repricing  they may react differently to changes in market interest rates 
also  interest rates on assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other assets and liabilities may follow changes in market interest rates 
additionally  certain assets have features that restrict changes in the interest rates of such assets  both on a short term basis and over the lives of such assets 
a change in market interest rates  prepayments and early withdrawals could cause significant deviation from the stated payments  maturities and repricings 
united security bancorporation the following table presents the aggregate maturities of loans in each major category of the banks loan portfolios at december  actual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities shown below as a result of renewals and prepayments

net interest income increased to  in compared to the increase in was to  over results 
the net interest income improvements were primarily the result of loan volume increases in and the company s net interest margin to average earning assets was   and in   and  respectively 
consistent with the decline in market interest rates the yield on earning assets dropped by

year the corporation is reviewing its automated systems and business processes to identify and correct any date related problems that may arise with the change of the century at december  the provider of the company s mainframe computer applications will provide a year software compliance update 
the company intends to install and test the release by september  the installation will also upgrade the mainframe operating systems 
the company is also reviewing its pc hardware and software and its major automated systems suppliers for year compliance 
a small number of pcs and pc systems will require upgrades 
usb  hsb  and bop are incorporating year issues into their standards of creditworthiness for new and renewed loans and are reviewing significant existing borrowers for year risk 
review in this area will continue through the cost of complying with the year issues is presently estimated to be  including staff time costs 
liquidity and capital resources management believes that the company s cash flow will be sufficient to support its existing operations for the foreseeable future 
if the company needs additional liquidity  it would be required to borrow or issue additional capital stock 
the company s ability to incur indebtedness is limited by government regulations and its ability to service borrowings is dependent upon the availability of dividends from the banks and nonbank subsidiaries 
the payment of dividends by the banks is subject to limitations imposed by law and governmental regulations 
the banks may borrow on a short term basis to compensate for reductions in other sources of funds 
bank borrowings may also be used on a longer term basis to support expanded lending activities and to match the maturity of repricing intervals of assets 
united security bancorporation the company s total stockholders equity increased to  at december   from  at december  and  at december  at december   stockholders equity was of total assets  compared to at december  the reduction was the results of the acquisitions of bop and five wells fargo branches during at december   the company held cash and cash equivalent assets of million 
at such date  virtually all of the company s investment securities million in aggregate amount were available for sale 
the capital levels of the company and each of the banks currently exceeded applicable regulatory capital guidelines at december  during  the company issued and sold  million shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering  which yielded net proceeds to the company after deduction of commissions  selling expenses and related offering costs of million 
proceeds from the sale were allocated among the company s subsidiaries 
effects of inflation and changing prices 
the primary impact of inflation on the company s operations is increased asset yields  deposit costs and operating overhead 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates 
the effects of inflation can magnify the growth of assets  and if significant  would require that equity capital increase at a faster rate than would otherwise be necessary
