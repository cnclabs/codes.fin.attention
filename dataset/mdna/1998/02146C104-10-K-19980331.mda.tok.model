liquidity and capital resources for the years ended december   and  the company experienced cash flow deficits from operations of  million and million  respectively 
these cash flow deficits were primarily a result of the company s significant development of new residences  which typically incur cash flow deficits during the lease up period and general and administrative expenses necessary to support the company s early growth 
in  the cash flow deficit was also caused by restructuring and transaction costs of approximately million which were expended to effect the sterling merger 
during the year ended december   the company raised approximately million of financing 
financing was provided by million in net proceeds from the may offering of the debentures  a concurrent offering of convertible subordinated debentures due the debentures and common stock in december which provided net proceeds of million and million  respectively  million of sale leaseback financing  million of secured bridge loan financing incurred in advance of anticipated sale leaseback transactions involving the encumbered residences  million of net additional construction and permanent loan financing  million of unsecured short term financing  million in short term financing to be paid off as construction is completed on six residences pursuant to a sale leaseback agreement  million of minority partner contributions and cash from operations

the remaining million of financing resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents at year end 
in december  the company completed the offering of million of the debentures and  shares of common stock together  the concurrent offering 
net proceeds to the company from the concurrent offering totaled million 
in january  overallotment options were exercised by the underwriters of the concurrent offering resulting in additional net proceeds to the company of million 
due to the concurrent offering proceeds received in december  the company had working capital of approximately million at december   compared to working capital of million at december  on november   the company completed a sale leaseback transaction totaling million of which i million was used to repay secured bridge loan financing outstanding  million of which was classified as short term  ii million was held in escrow to fund construction in progress on six residences and iii million was available to fund future development activities 
this transaction involved the sale and immediate leaseback by the company of residences having an aggregate capacity of residents 
giving effect to the sterling merger  the company s earnings were inadequate to cover fixed charges by million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the company expects that its earnings will not be sufficient to cover its fixed charges in future periods 
accordingly  the company may have to incur additional indebtedness in the future to cover its fixed charges 
to achieve its growth objectives  the company will need to obtain sufficient financing to fund its development  construction and acquisition activities 
this need for financing has increased substantially due to the sterling merger 
the company has plans to develop approximately million of residences through the end of historically  the company has financed its development program and acquisitions through a combination of various forms of real estate financing mortgage and sale leaseback financing  capital contributions from joint venture partners and the sale of its securities 
the company currently has executed non binding letters of intent with various health care reits for financing commitments aggregating approximately million  million of which has been utilized by the company through december  in addition  the company has obtained million of commitments from conventional financing lenders for the purpose of providing permanent financing on stabilized residences 
as of december   million of this conventional financing has been utilized 
in addition to financing construction and development costs  the company will require capital resources to meet its operating and working capital needs incurred primarily through the start up and lease up phases of new residences 
the company believes that its cash on hand  financing under these commitments and other financing that the company expects to be able to access and equity contributions from its joint venture development partners  will be sufficient to fund its growth strategy for the next months 
a lack of funds may require the company to delay or eliminate all or some of its development projects and acquisition plans 
in addition  the company may require additional financing to enable it to acquire additional residences  to respond to changing economic conditions  to expand the company s development program or to account for changes in assumptions related to its development program 
there can be no assurance that any newly constructed residences will achieve a stabilized occupancy level and attain a resident mix that meet the company s expectations or generate sufficient positive cash flow to cover operating and financing costs associated with such residences 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in securing additional financing or that adequate funding will be available and  if available  will be on terms that are acceptable to the company 
the company is obligated under its joint venture arrangements to purchase the equity interests of its joint venture partners upon the election of such partners upon agreed upon terms and conditions 
see business joint ventures and strategic alliances 
within the next twelve months  the company will become subject to such contingent purchase obligations with respect to equity interests held by joint venture partners  exercisable at their election  related to certain of the company s residences 
at such times as such contingent purchase obligations are exercisable  the company may also elect to exercise its rights to purchase such interests 
based on a number of assumptions  including assumptions as to the number of residences to be developed with joint venture partners  the timing of such development  the time at which such options will be exercised and the fair market value of such residences at the date such options are exercised  the company estimates that it may require approximately million to million to satisfy these purchase obligations during impact of inflation to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company 
inflation could  however  affect the company s results of operations due to the company s dependence on its senior resident population who rely on liquid assets and relatively fixed incomes to pay for the company s services 
as a result  the company may not be able to increase residence service fees to account fully for increased operating expenses 
in structuring its fees  the company attempts to anticipate inflation levels  but there can be no assurance that the company will be able to anticipate fully or otherwise respond to any future inflationary pressures 
in addition  given the significant amount of construction and development activity which the company anticipates  inflationary pressures could affect the company s cost of new product deployment and financing 
there can be no assurances that financing will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
year issue as a result of certain computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  any of the company s computer systems that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year the so called year issue 
this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in normal business activities 
the company is in the process of evaluating its computer systems to determine what modification if any are necessary to make such systems compatible with the year requirements 
however  because many of the company s computer systems have been put into service within the last several years  or are currently being replaced with year compliant systems  the company does not expect any such modifications to have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
there can be no assurance  however  that the computer systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely modified  or that a failure to modify such systems by another company  or modifications that are incompatible with the company s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on the company
