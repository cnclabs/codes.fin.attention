the exchange transaction was completed april   and  as a result  the corporations became wholly owned subsidiaries of the company  and each shareholder of the company received a number of shares of common stock in the company 
in addition  subsequent to the completion of the offering  the company purchased  shares of common stock owned by michael d 
domec  an original principal of the company  at an aggregate purchase price of million  or per share 
the company s audited financial statements for each of the fiscal years presented in this form k prior to fiscal include the results of operations of four restaurants that were closed prior to the company s public offering 
these restaurants did not conform to the company s operating model at the time of the offering in one or more important respects such as location demographics  exterior identification or menu format or were operated by persons other than shareholders of the company the non contributed restaurants 
although the operations of the non contributed restaurants affected the company s results of operations in each of the prior fiscal years  the majority of the costs associated with the closure of these restaurants impacted fiscal and fiscal two non contributed restaurants were closed during each of fiscal and fiscal the non contributed restaurants located in abilene and midland were managed by persons other than the shareholders of the operating corporations  and the midland restaurant lacked the signage and other elements of the exterior decor associated with the casa ole concept 
the other non contributed restaurants  located in lubbock and the woodlands  were in line shopping center locations

prior to the company s initial public offering in april  a significant portion of the company s operating expenses was attributable to the compensation of larry n

domec  the original principals of the company  and payment of compensation and fees to certain of their respective affiliates 
subsequent to the offering  mr 
domec has continued to serve as a director of the company  but is no longer an employee and has instead focused on development of additional casa ole restaurants in his capacity as a franchisee

forehand became director of franchise services and remains as a member of the board of directors 
in addition  certain transactions and compensation arrangements between the company and affiliates of messrs 
forehand and domec were terminated subsequent to the offering

neeb  curt glowacki and andrew dennard 
the pro forma effect of the elimination of mr 
domec s compensation and payments to certain entities related to messrs 
domec and forehand  the reduction in mr 
forehand s compensation and the compensation arrangements for the new executive officers is reflected in the financial statements and supplementary data consolidated statements of income found elsewhere in this report

income tax expense 
effective with the initial public offering  the company became subject to federal and state taxes as a c corporation 
the company s effective tax rate since becoming a c corporation in fiscal was 
during the company s first fiscal quarter when substantially all of the corporations were taxed as s corporations under the provisions of subchapter s of the code  the federal income taxes on the net income of the corporations were payable personally by the shareholders 
the provision for income taxes reflected in the first quarter of fiscal is for state franchise taxes on all restaurants and for federal income taxes on the corporations which were taxable as c corporations 
liquidity and capital resources in late april  the company received the proceeds from its initial public offering of  shares of common stock 
on may  million of the proceeds were used to redeem  shares of common stock owned by michael d 
domec 
approximately million of the proceeds were used to cover offering related costs  including underwriting discounts and commissions 
the remaining proceeds were used for the development or acquisition of additional restaurants  the purchase of of the outstanding shares of mac on july   the continued implementation of the point of sale system  the remodel of existing restaurants and for general corporate purposes 
the company met fiscal capital requirements with cash generated by operations  remaining proceeds from the fiscal initial public offering and with draws on its credit facilities 
in fiscal  the company s operations generated approximately million in cash  as compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal as of december   the company had a working capital deficit of approximately million  compared with a working capital surplus of approximately million at december  a working capital deficit is common in the restaurant industry  since restaurant companies do not typically require a significant investment in either accounts receivable or inventory 
the company s principal capital requirements are the funding of new restaurant development or acquisitions and remodeling of older units 
during fiscal  capital expenditures on property  plant and equipment were approximately million as compared to approximately million for fiscal the company constructed and opened six new units  purchased or otherwise secured three real estate sites  acquired a franchise unit  remodeled several of the older restaurants and installed a point of sale system in many of the stores 
opening additional company owned restaurants is a key component of its expansion strategy  and management plans to open a combination of four company owned and market partner restaurants during the balance of fiscal currently the company has one site under construction and one site nearing ground breaking 
the estimated capital needed for such openings  along with preparing for openings and for general corporate purposes  including the remodel of an estimated eight units  is approximately million 
this estimate is based upon an anticipated total investment up to  per restaurant  of which approximately  is anticipated to represent furniture  fixtures and equipment and approximately  represents training and pre opening expenses  and is inclusive of the capitalized cost of leasing or acquiring real estate 
this estimate  however  does not include any amounts related to any significant acquisitions 
the acquisition of mac in july was funded using cash on hand of approximately million and funds available to the company under its amended credit facility with nationsbank of texas  na 
the terms of the amended credit facility are similar to those in the original facility  however  the facility was expanded to million  with million designated as a term note payable over six years  and the remaining million designated as a revolving credit line 
the interest rate on both components of the credit agreement is either the prime rate or libor plus a stipulated percentage 
accordingly  the company is impacted by changes in the prime rate and libor 
the company is subject to a non use fee of on the unused portion of the revolver from the date of the credit agreement 
within the terms of the credit agreement  the company must meet certain financial covenants 
in fiscal  the company was in technical non compliance with certain debt covenants due to special charges incurred in the third and fourth quarters 
the bank either amended or waived all technical non compliance matters 
the revolving line may be used for certain acquisitions  construction of new units and other working capital needs 
at december   the company had million outstanding under the term facility and approximately million outstanding under the revolver 
in addition to developing new restaurants  the company intends to add company owned restaurants through selective acquisitions of existing franchisees 
as mentioned above  the company acquired its second franchise restaurant during fiscal and acquired its first franchise restaurant in fiscal the company s management is currently negotiating a sale leaseback agreement that will include forward commitments for new unit development for fiscal and fiscal management believes that a sale leaseback arrangement  along with operating cash flow and the company s revolving line of credit with nationsbank  will be sufficient to meet its operating requirements and to finance its expansion plans exclusive of any significant acquisitions through the end of the fiscal year 
risk factors the company cautions readers that its business is subject to a number of risks  any of which could cause the actual results of the company to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made from time to time in releases  including this form k  and oral statements 
such risks were presented in the company s form s registration statement  which was declared effective on april   and the related prospectus  and are being presented again in this form k 
certain risk factors have been presented throughout this document  including  among others  expansion strategy  site selection  attracting and retaining franchisees  managers and other employees  availability of food products  competition and government regulation 
certain other risks to which the company is subject include seasonality 
the company s sales and earnings fluctuate seasonally 
historically the company s highest sales and earnings have occurred in the third and fourth calendar quarters  which the company believes is typical of the restaurant industry and consumer spending patterns in general with respect to the third quarter and is due to increased holiday traffic at the company s mall restaurants for the fourth quarter 
in addition  quarterly results have been and  in the future are likely to be  substantially affected by the timing of new restaurant openings 
because of the seasonality of the company s business and the impact of new restaurant openings  results for any calendar quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year and cannot be used to indicate financial performance for the entire year 
impact of inflation market risks 
the company does not believe that inflation has materially impacted net income during the past three years 
substantial increases in costs and expenses  particularly food  supplies  labor and operating expenses  could have a significant impact on the company s operating results to the extent such increases cannot be passed along to customers 
if operating expenses increase  management intends to attempt to recover increased costs by increasing prices to the extent deemed advisable considering competitive conditions 
the company does not have or participate in transactions involving derivative  financial and commodity instruments 
accelerating growth strategy 
the company s ability to expand by adding company owned  market partner and franchised restaurants will depend on a number of factors  including the availability of suitable locations  the ability to hire  train and retain an adequate number of experienced management and hourly employees  the availability of acceptable lease terms and adequate financing  timely construction of restaurants  the ability to obtain various government permits and licenses and other factors  some of which are beyond the control of the company  its franchisees and market partners 
the opening of additional franchised restaurants will depend  in part  upon the ability of existing and future franchisees to obtain financing or investment capital adequate to meet their market development obligations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to open the number of restaurants it currently plans to open or that new restaurants can be operated profitably 
in addition  the company intends to expand into new geographic markets in which it has no operating experience and in which mexican and tex mex food restaurants are less prevalent than in texas 
consumer tastes vary from region to region in the united states  and there can be no assurance that customers located in the regions of the united states into which the company intends to expand will be as receptive to mexican and tex mex food or the casa ole concept as those customers in its existing markets 
there can be no assurance as to the success of the company s efforts to expand into other geographic regions or that the cost of such efforts will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
small restaurant base and geographic concentration 
the results achieved to date by the company s relatively small restaurant base may not be indicative of the results of a larger number of restaurants in a more geographically dispersed area 
because of the company s relatively small restaurant base  an unsuccessful new restaurant could have a more significant effect on the company s results of operations than would be the case in a company owning more restaurants 
additionally  given the company s present geographic concentration all company owned units are currently in texas  results of operations may be adversely affected by economic or other conditions in the region and adverse publicity relating to the company s restaurants could have a more pronounced adverse effect on the company s overall sales than might be the case if the company s restaurants were more broadly dispersed

forehand  michael d 
domec  louis p 
neeb and john c 
textor 
shares eligible for future sale and stock price 
sales of substantial amounts of shares in the public market could adversely affect the market price of the common stock

forehand to louis p 
neeb  tex mex partners  lc  patrick a 
morris and stacy m 
riffe to register the  underlying shares of common stock covered by such warrants in connection with registrations otherwise undertaken by the company 
in any event  the market price of the common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to the company s operating results and other factors 
competition 
the restaurant industry is intensely competitive 
the company competes against other family dining concepts  as well as quick service and casual dining concepts  for customers  employees  franchisees and market partners 
see item business competition 
year the company is in the process of evaluating computer processing alternatives 
currently  most accounting processes are handled on an outsourcing basis with entities that are expected to have year issues 
the company is evaluating whether these processes will continue to be outsourced or internalized 
a final decision is expected during fiscal and management does not believe that the ultimate decision will have a significant adverse impact on the financial results or operations of the company
