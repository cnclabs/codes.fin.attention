item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources during the last three years the company has funded all capital expenditures from internally generated funds  cash equivalents  and long term debt 
capital expenditures for fiscal were  a decrease from fiscal this decrease resulted from the opening of five new restaurants in fiscal as compared to in fiscal  which included two relocations 
fiscal capital expenditures included the purchase of locations from triangle foodservice corporation  formerly wyatt cafeterias  inc  for approximately million in cash 
after additional capital expenditures of approximately million to repair and refurbish these units  of the locations were opened as luby s and are included in the openings in fiscal in addition  during fiscal the company purchased one site as land held for future use compared to eight in fiscal the company also spent approximately million to upgrade the restaurant information systems during fiscal plans for fiscal include the opening of approximately six new restaurants four on sites owned by the company and two on land held under long term ground leases 
the company also expects fiscal capital expenditures to include approximately million related to strategic initiatives  including food to go expansions  new self service drink stations  and to remodels with updated design features 
in addition  as part of its strategic initiative to expand into smaller texas markets  planned expenditures for fiscal include approximately million for the opening of the first location by the end of the fiscal year and the purchase of several other land sites for fiscal openings 
the company anticipates that proceeds from property held for sale will partially offset future capital requirements 
as part of a joint venture agreement with waterstreet  inc signed in january  the company opened two seafood restaurants in fiscal during fiscal  the company closed one seafood restaurant which was opened the prior year 
no seafood restaurants are planned to open in fiscal these water street seafood company restaurants are leased by the joint venture from the company and operated by waterstreet  inc as of august   the company owned three undeveloped restaurant sites  and several land site acquisitions were in varying stages of negotiation 
as a result of more new store openings planned for next year  the company expects an increase in total capital expenditures for fiscal construction costs for new restaurants are expected to be funded by cash flow from operations  cash currently held in cash equivalent investments  and long term debt 
the company generated cash from operations of  in fiscal the company had  outstanding at august   under a  credit facility with a syndication of four banks 
at august   the company had a working capital deficit of  which compares to the prior year s working capital deficit of  the working capital position declined slightly during fiscal due primarily to the decrease in cash and cash equivalents of  the company typically carries current liabilities in excess of current assets because cash generated from operating activities is reinvested in capital expenditures 
the company believes that funds generated from operations and short term or long term financing from external sources  which can be obtained on terms acceptable to the company  are adequate for its foreseeable needs 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal sales increased  or  due to the addition of five new restaurants in fiscal and restaurants in fiscal this increase was partially offset by the closing of two restaurants on august   and three others during fiscal the average sales volume for all restaurants that were open in both years increased slightly to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the same store customer counts were down by but were offset by higher average tray revenues 
cost of food increased  or  due primarily to the increase in sales  new menu item testing  and higher fish and other commodity prices overall 
payroll and related costs increased  or  due primarily to the increase in sales and the higher federal minimum wage which increased first on october   and again on september  occupancy and other operating expenses increased  or  due primarily to the increase in sales and the opening of five new restaurants 
this increase was partially offset by lower managers salaries  which are based on the profitability of the restaurants 
general and administrative expenses increased  or  due primarily to higher legal and professional fees associated with the company s strategic planning project 
in addition  fiscal included a higher provision for bonuses since none were incurred in fiscal and a higher company contribution to the profit sharing plan 
as part of its strategic planning efforts  the company completed an assessment of underperforming restaurants and recorded a million pretax charge during the fourth quarter of fiscal the charge included million for the closing of underperforming restaurants  million for the write down of restaurants which will be relocated to optimize their market potential  and million for the write down of certain restaurant properties which the company plans to continue to operate 
additionally  the company revised its estimate of the net realizable value of surplus properties which the company plans to sell resulting in an additional write down of million 
the charge for the closing of the underperforming restaurants and the restaurants to be relocated related to the write down of property and equipment to net realizable value  costs to settle lease obligations  and severance costs 
as of august   two of the restaurants were closed  and the remaining restaurants are planned for closure during fiscal interest expense of  for fiscal was incurred in conjunction with borrowings under the credit facility and is net of  capitalized on qualifying properties 
the increase over fiscal of  or  was due primarily to lower capitalized interest on qualifying properties as a result of less construction in the current period 
the average borrowing rate was also slightly higher in fiscal the provision for income taxes decreased  or  due to lower income before income taxes 
the company s effective income tax rate increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the fiscal rate was low due to a nonrecurring decrease in the deferred tax liability resulting from a lower expected state tax rate 
the company anticipates that the effective tax rate for fiscal will approximate the rate during fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal sales increased  or  due to the addition of new restaurants in fiscal and restaurants in fiscal the average sales volume of restaurants opened over one year decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due primarily to a negative trend in customer counts 
this trend was a result of intense competition in the restaurant industry and sales transfer from our established restaurants caused by the significant number of fiscal and openings in our existing markets 
the impact of the same store customer count decline was partially offset by a increase in average tray revenues 
the company implemented a price increase on september   to help offset the pressure on profit margins from the increase in the federal minimum wage 
cost of food increased  or  due primarily to the increase in sales 
payroll and related costs increased  or  due primarily to the increase in sales  the increase in the federal minimum wage which became effective october   and higher wage costs associated with increased expansion over the prior year 
although a price increase was implemented to help offset higher wage rates  the decline in same store sales experienced during fiscal resulted in significant pressure on labor costs 
occupancy and other operating expenses increased  or  due primarily to the increase in sales and the opening of new restaurants 
preopening expenses and start up costs  which are expensed as incurred  totaled approximately million for new openings in fiscal the decline in same store sales caused fixed costs within this expense category to increase as a percent of sales 
however  managers salaries  which are based on the profitability of the restaurants  decreased as a percent of sales due to lower store profits 
general and administrative expenses decreased  or 
as a result of lower earnings  the company s contribution to the profit sharing plan totaled million  or million less than fiscal this decrease was partially offset by retirement costs  executive search firm fees  and higher legal and professional fees associated with the company s restructuring into a holding company 
in addition  manager trainee salaries and moving expenses were higher than fiscal due to the increased expansion 
during fiscal the company adopted financial accounting standards no 
fas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and recorded a million pretax charge during the fourth quarter 
the charge included million for the closing of four restaurants  million for the write down of certain cafeteria properties which the company plans to continue to operate  the write down of million for surplus properties the company plans to sell  million for the write down of computer hardware  and million for various other charges 
interest expense of  for fiscal was incurred in conjunction with borrowings under the credit facility and is net of  capitalized on qualifying properties 
the increase over fiscal of  or  was due to higher average outstanding borrowings relating to the increase in expansion during fiscal and the purchase of treasury stock 
the provision for income taxes decreased  or  due to lower income before income taxes and lower state taxes resulting from the company s restructuring into a holding company 
the company s effective income tax rate decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal a portion of the decline in the provision for income taxes in fiscal was nonrecurring since it resulted from lowering the deferred tax liability based on a lower expected state tax rate 
inflation the company s policy is to maintain stable menu prices without regard to seasonal variations in food costs 
general increases in costs of food  wages  supplies  and services make it necessary for the company to increase its menu prices from time to time 
to the extent prevailing market conditions allow  the company intends to adjust menu prices to maintain profit margins 
the year some of the company s older computer programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  those computer programs have time sensitive software that recognizes a date using as the year rather than the year this could cause a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  code invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company does not expect that the year issue will materially affect future financial results 
the company has formed a year committee and has developed a plan to inventory critical systems and replace or develop solutions to those systems that are found to have date related deficiencies 
the completion of the solution phase is estimated to be prior to any anticipated impact on our systems 
the company is also surveying suppliers and customers to determine the status of their year compliance programs
