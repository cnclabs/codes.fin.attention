funds from operations management believes that funds from operations ffo should be considered in conjunction with net income  as presented in the statements of operations included elsewhere herein  to facilitate a clearer understanding of the operating results of the company 
management considers ffo an appropriate measure of performance for an equity real estate investment trust 
ffo  as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  is net income applicable to common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  exclusive of outparcel sales  plus depreciation and amortization as defined by nareit  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
ffo does not represent net income or cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or to cash from operations  and is not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs
