in the united states  canada and western europe  demand is driven by new  more convenient products  such as credit debit card readers  and by environmental regulations  such as those requiring vapor recovery systems and more secure underground storage tanks 
in emerging markets  such as eastern europe  africa and southeast asia  economic growth is promoting vehicle use and infrastructure development  which increase the demand for fuel and fuel dispensers 
deregulation of local markets and privatization of state owned oil companies have created additional growth opportunities in central and south america

the acquisition of sofitam has significantly extended the company s international distribution network  reducing its reliance on us domestic sales 
sales of petroleum dispenser equipment have historically been seasonal  primarily due to the construction season and moc purchasing which typically is highest at the end of the calendar year 
historically  approximately of tokheim s annual net sales volume has been recorded in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year  with no significant variation among the other three quarters 
the acquisition of sofitam has diminished such seasonality  with the fourth quarter representing of consolidated annual sales 
because of the company s relatively low profit margins  the relatively higher sales in the fourth quarter have translated into a disproportionately high contribution to the company s annual earnings
