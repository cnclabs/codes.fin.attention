in addition  the company currently expects to incur less than million of capital expenditures during  primarily for upgrading funeral home facilities 
the company believes that cash flow from operations  borrowings under the new credit facility and its ability to issue additional debt and equity securities should be sufficient to fund acquisitions and its anticipated capital expenditures and other operating requirements for in march  the company filed a shelf registration statement relating to  shares of class a common stock to be issued to fund acquisitions

because future cash flows and the availability of financing are subject to a number of variables  such as the number and size of acquisitions made by the company  there can be no assurance that the company s capital resources will be sufficient to fund its capital needs 
additional debt and equity financing may be required to maintain the company s acquisition program 
the availability and terms of these capital sources will depend on prevailing market conditions and interest rates and the then existing financial condition of the company
