although sales in the pacific rim have historically been less than ten percent of total revenue  the company was expecting an increase in revenue from this geographic area 
the general sales cycles for distribution of the company s products are similar to those of most businesses selling products designed for use as part of large systems  and range from three to six months for value added resellers var and small system integrators and from one to two years for original equipment manufacturers oem  product integrators and large system integrators 
cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  was approximately in  in and in cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased by seven percentage points in as compared to primarily due to reductions in manufacturing and material cost and increased sales volume 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales in was principally impacted by a price reduction for all units of in the fourth quarter of and a shift in product mix towards higher sales of smaller capacity units which have lower margins than the larger capacity units 
this shift was due in part to the federal government shutdown which began in late fourth quarter of and continued until march  which impacted sales of the large capacity units favored by governmental agencies 
in addition  gross margins in were also affected by an increase in manufacturing engineering personnel to allow for a shift of sustaining product responsibility from research and development to manufacturing 
although gross margin improved in as compared to  the company s relatively low gross margins reflect the company s low levels of net sales  which have resulted in unabsorbed manufacturing costs and high costs of materials due to the inability to achieve purchasing economies of scale due to low sales volume 
the company expects that as product sales continue to increase  costs of sales per unit of product will decrease because fixed manufacturing costs will be distributed over the larger sales volume  and material costs will decrease as a result of volume purchases 
research and development expenses were  in   in and  in the primary reason for the increase in as compared to was an increase in project material related to the company s next generation product line

as of december  the company had borrowings of  under the bank line of credit 
the ability to sustain its operations for a significant period after december   will depend on the company s ability to significantly increase sales or raise significant additional equity or debt financing 
there is no assurance that any of these conditions will be achieved
