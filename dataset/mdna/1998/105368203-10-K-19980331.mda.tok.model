ffo is calculated as net income loss adjusted for depreciation expense attributable to real property  amortization expense attributable to capitalized leasing costs  gains on sales of real estate investments and extraordinary and nonrecurring items 
ffo should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the company s performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
ffo for the years ended december  and is summarized in the following table in thousands  except share and per share data 
year ended december  income before minority interest  add deduct depreciation attributable to real property   amortization attributable to leasing costs minority interest not attributable to unit holders funds from operations before minority interest   weighted average common shares including common share equivalents and operating partnership units   funds from operations per share includes the weighted average effect of  common shares issued upon the conversion of preferred shares for the period prior to conversion  the weighted average effect of  common shares issuable upon the conversion of  units  the weighted average effect of the  common shares issued upon the conversion of  units for the period prior to conversion and the weighted average effect of the  convertible units for the period prior to cancellation 
in the company began computing ffo using a methodology which  in management s opinion  is more consistent with industry practice

inflation a majority of the company s leases provide for separate escalations of real estate taxes and operating expenses either on a triple net basis or over a base amount 
in addition  many of the office leases provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed escalations based on the cpi or other measure 
the company believes that inflationary increases in expenses will be significantly offset by the expense reimbursement and contractual rent increases
