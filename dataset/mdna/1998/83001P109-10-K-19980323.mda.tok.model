the company s liquidity could be adversely affected by unfavorable weather  accidents or the occurrence of an event or condition  including negative publicity or significant local competitive events  that significantly reduces paid attendance and  therefore  revenue at any of its theme parks 
on june   a slide collapsed at the company s waterworld park in concord  california  resulting in one fatality and the park s closure for twelve days 
the park re opened with the approval of the city of concord on june  although the collapse and the resulting closure had a material adverse impact on that park s operating performance for  as well as a lesser impact on the company s sacramento water park which is also named waterworld  located approximately seventy miles from the concord park  the company s other parks were not adversely affected 
the company has recovered all of the concord park s operating shortfall under its business interruption insurance 
in addition  the company believes that its liability insurance coverage should be more than adequate to provide for any personal injury liability which may ultimately be found to exist in connection with the collapse 
the company believes that  based on current and anticipated operating results  cash flow from operations  available cash  available borrowings under the credit facilities and the net proceeds of the offerings to the extent not used in connection with the six flags acquisition will be adequate to meet the company s future liquidity needs  including anticipated requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  scheduled debt and preferred stock dividends and its obligations under arrangements relating to the co venture parks  for at least the next several years 
the company may  however  need to refinance all or a portion of its debt on or prior to maturity or to obtain additional financing 
newly issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 reporting comprehensive income 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a set of financial statements 
it requires that all items that are required to be recognized under accounting standards as components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements 
the company currently does not have any components of comprehensive income that are not included in net income 
after the acquisition of walibi  the only item not currently included in the company s consolidated statement of operations would be the currency translation adjustment that will be reported as part of stockholders equity after the acquisition 
the company will adopt sfas no 
in the year also in june  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  was issued 
sfas no 
is effective for periods beginning after december  sfas no 
requires that a public entity report financial and descriptive information about its reportable segments 
operating segments are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
the company will adopt sfas no 
in however  such adoption is not expected to impact the company s financial disclosures because the company s current operations are limited to one reportable operating segment under sfas no 
s definitions 
after the acquisition of walibi  the company will be required to disclose certain financial information related to its foreign operations 
in january  the securities and exchange commission issued release no 
 which requires enhanced descriptions of accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments in the footnotes to financial statements 
the release also requires certain quantitative and qualitative disclosure outside financial statements about market risks inherent in market risk sensitive instruments and other financial instruments 
the requirements regarding accounting policy descriptions were effective for any fiscal period ending after june  however  because derivative financial and commodity instruments have not materially affected the company s consolidated financial position  cash flows or results of operations  this part of the release does not affect the company s financial statement disclosures 
the quantitative and qualitative disclosures required by the release will be initially provided in the company s annual report on form k for the year ending december  impact of year issue an issue exists for all companies that rely on computers as the year approaches 
the year problem is the result of past practices in the computer industry of using two digits rather than four to identify the applicable year 
this practice will result in incorrect results when computers perform arithmetic operations  comparisons or data field sorting involving years later than the company anticipates that it will be able to test its entire system using its internal programming staff and outside computer consultants and intends to make any necessary modifications to prevent disruption to its operations 
costs in connection with any such modifications are not expected to be material
