the restaurant industry in registrant s service continues to exhibit weakness 
california  in particular  has been slow to show growth 
the aftermath of the frosts in the brazil coffee growing areas and a perceived shortage of coffee beans perpetrated by the acpc  ico  and the brazilian growers during fiscal have caused the green coffee market to make dramatic price swings 
coffee prices increased from december  to the end of may  the market may have stabilized during fiscal  and world green coffee prices have been pressured by a large brazilian coffee crop 
higher green coffee costs result in higher prices of roast coffee that result in lower sales volume 
during green coffee costs have declined  and competitive pressures continue to force decreases in the selling price of roast coffee 
although profit margins are more in line with historic results  competition from non coffee beverages  both hot and cold  have reduced market share 
as a result  the company has worked hard to maintain and improve its distribution system  has added and experimented with new allied products and tried to restrain operating costs  with special attention toward making its operations more efficient

coffee is an agricultural product that is produced in many nations around the world 
although it is consumed in those nations  the largest coffee consuming nation is the united states  followed by the nations of western europe 
green coffee is traded domestically on the new york coffee  sugar cocoa exchange csce  and is one of the largest and most volatile commodity markets 
the most important aspect of the company s operations is to secure a consistent supply of coffee 
some proportion of green coffee price fluctuations can be passed through to registrant s customers  even if lagging the market changes  but maintaining a steady supply of green coffee is essential to keep inventory levels low and sufficient stock to meet customer needs 
registrant purchases all its coffee through established coffee brokers  many of which are large international firms  to help minimize the risk of default on coffee deliveries 
the company purchases much of its coffee on forward contracts  occasionally for delivery as long as six months in the future 
sometimes these contracts are fixed price contracts  regardless of the change in the price of green coffee between the contract and delivery dates 
at other times these contracts are variable price contracts  that allow the delivered price of contracted coffee to reflect the market price of coffee at the delivery date 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued the company occasionally uses futures contracts to hedge exposure to coffee price fluctuations 
gains on hedging transactions are deferred as an adjustment to the carrying value of the inventory 
losses on the hedging transactions are recognized in earnings currently and the company s green coffee inventory is adjusted currently through its lifo methodology 
futures contracts not designated as hedges  and terminations of contracts designated as hedges are marked to market and changes are recognized in current earnings 
the company had no open contracts at june   and year issues with the arrival of the year  there exists a significant issue that directly impacts the ability of information systems and non computing equipment to handle dates in their processing 
management continues to assess these issues  and has identified three major computer systems that are not year compliant 
efforts are underway to convert or replace these systems to new software and or new hardware 
the cost of the conversion of these systems is not material and has been expensed as incurred 
registrant expect to be substantially completed during fiscal production hardware  non information technology systems and external agents have been assessed 
registrant continues to review the situation  but has no reason at this time to believe that any material impact will result
