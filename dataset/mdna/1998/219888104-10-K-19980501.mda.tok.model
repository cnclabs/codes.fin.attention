the repayment of debt includes the repayment of debt of acquired companies 
the company believes that the borrowing capacity under the senior secured credit facility  together with proceeds from future debt and equity financings  in addition to the company s cash on hand  capital resources and cash flows  will be sufficient to fund the company s ongoing operations  anticipated capital expenditures and acquisition activity for the next twelve months 
however  actual capital needs may change  particularly in connection with acquisitions which the company may complete in the future 
inflation certain of the company s product offerings  particularly paper products  have been and are expected to continue to be subject to significant price fluctuations due to inflationary and other market conditions 
the company generally is able to pass such increased costs on to its customers through price increases  although it may not be able to adjust its prices immediately 
significant increases in paper  fuel and other costs in the future could materially affect the company s profitability if these costs cannot be passed on to customers 
in general  the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its results of operations in recent years 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
seasonality and quarterly results the company s product distribution business is subject to seasonal influences 
in particular  net sales and profits in the united states  canada and europe are typically lower in the summer months due to lower levels of business activity 
because cost of sales includes delivery and occupancy expenses  gross profit as a percentage of net sales may be impacted by seasonal fluctuations in net sales  higher delivery costs during inclement weather  and the acquisition of less efficient operations 
quarterly results may be materially affected by the timing of acquisitions and the timing and magnitude of acquisition integration costs 
therefore  the operating results for any three month period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for a full fiscal year 
revenues and profit margins from the company s local delivery services are subject to seasonal variations 
prolonged inclement weather can have an adverse impact on the company s business to the extent that transportation and distribution channels are disrupted

on march   the accounting standards executive committee acsec issued statement of position sop providing guidance on accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
the effective date of this pronouncement is for fiscal years beginning after december  the company is in the process of reviewing its current policies of accounting for costs associated with internal software development projects and how they may be affected by sop the company believes its current policies are materially consistent with the sop  however  the ultimate impact on the company s future results of operations has not yet been determined 
impact of the year issue the year issue is a result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system job failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar business activities 
the company s isis computer software has been designed with the year issue in mind  and the company believes it is year compliant  however  corporate express utilizes many different systems and software programs to process and summarize business transactions 
the company is continuing the evaluation of its various operating systems and determining the additional remediation efforts required to ensure its computer systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  preliminary results of this assessment have revealed that remediation efforts required will vary from system to system 
for example  it appears some systems will not require any additional programming efforts  while others may require significant programming changes 
the company has initiated formal communications with all of its significant suppliers and large customers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issue 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
for those systems identified as non compliant  the company has begun and  in certain cases  completed remediation efforts 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  and test the software for year modifications 
the company plans to complete the year project before january  the total estimated cost of the year project is estimated to be between  and  and is being funded through operating cash flows 
these costs are not expected to be material to the company s consolidated results of operations 
of the total project cost  approximately  is attributable to the purchase of new software or equipment which will be capitalized 
the remaining  to  will be expensed as incurred 
in a number of instances  the company may decide to install new software or upgraded versions of current software programs which are year compliant 
in these instances  the company may capitalize certain costs of the new system in accordance with current accounting guidelines 
the company presently believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software for those sites which it believes may be effected  the year issue can be mitigated 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material adverse impact on the operations of the company 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company plans to complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans
