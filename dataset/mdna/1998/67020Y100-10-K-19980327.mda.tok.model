item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements 
except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this document and notes to financial statements contained in item of this report are forward looking statements that involve certain risk and uncertainties  including the risks and uncertainties discussed below 
overview visioneer was incorporated in california in march  and commenced shipment of its initial product in the first quarter of through september  the company financed its operations primarily through private placements of equity securities  from which it raised an aggregate of approximately million  net of issuance costs 
in december  the company reincorporated in delaware in conjunction with its initial public offering and raised million  net of issuance costs 
in january  the over allotment option granted to the underwriters in the initial public offering was exercised  resulting in additional net proceeds of approximately million 
the company has experienced sequential growth in annual net revenues since the first year of product shipments 
the dramatic annual growth rates between and were directly attributed to the equally dramatic growth of the sheetfed scanner and document management software markets  the development of oem relationships and new product introductions 
in sharp contrast  the single digit growth rate from to was attributed to several factors 
first  the grayscale sheetfed scanner market declined sharply with the advent of color sheetfed scanners 
the transition of the market from grayscale to color occurred at a much faster rate than the company had anticipated  and as a result  the company recorded significant charges relating to grayscale inventory reserves  purchase order commitments and price protection charges in the first half of second  the company was late in introducing a color scanner product  and as a result  did not capture planned market share 
third  increased competition  caused overall sheetfed scanner average selling prices to drop significantly 
and finally  the growth of the sheetfed scanner market  despite its earlier significant growth rates  has leveled off  and  in fact  the market may be decreasing in size 
a key component of the company s business strategy is to penetrate the much larger and rapidly growing flatbed market by leveraging off of its award winning software 
historically  the company has bundled its paperport software with its scanner products  which has provided significant product differentiation 
in the second quarter of  the company decided to continue to leverage off the merits of its software in an attempt to penetrate the flatbed scanner market 
the paperport flatbed scanner line was introduced in september despite an intensely competitive market  the company s efforts appear initially to have been successful 
recent pc data reports indicate the company held nearly a share of the flatbed market for the months of december and january there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase its share of the flatbed scanner market or that it will be able to maintain it at the december and january levels 
the company has a limited operating history upon which an evaluation of the company and its prospects can be based 
the success of the company will depend on its ability to improve gross margins and generate sales of paperport products significantly in excess of sales during  which in turn will depend in part on the ability of the company and its distributors  resellers and oem partners to convince end users to adopt paper and image input systems for the desktop and to educate end users about the benefits of the company s products 
there can be no assurance that the market for the company s products will develop or that the company will achieve market acceptance of its products 
despite experiencing several quarters of minor levels of profitability throughout its brief history  most recently in the quarter ended december   the company has incurred annual net losses since inception 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain quarterly profitability or attain annual profitability in the near future 
as of december   the company had an accumulated deficit of million 
although the company has experienced revenue growth during the last several quarters  these growth rates may not be sustainable and are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 
results of operations the following table presents  as a percentage of total net revenues  certain selected financial data for each of the three years in the period ended december  year ended december  revenues product revenues royalty and development revenues total net revenues cost of revenues cost of product revenues cost of royalty and development revenues total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative non recurring items total operating expenses operating loss interest income interest expense net loss see note of notes to financial statements 
total net revenues the company derives its revenue primarily from three sources  the sale of paperport hardware products  paperport software products  and royalties and custom software development revenue  earned pursuant to arrangements with certain oem customers 
to date  approximately of the company s product revenues have been derived from sales of its paperport products to independent distributors in north america and  to a lesser extent  in europe and the asia pacific regions 
revenues from all sales to distributors and authorized resellers are subject to agreements allowing price protection and certain rights of return 
under the price protection rights granted by the company  if the company lowers its selling price it is then obligated to issue credit to its distributors and resellers equal to the difference between the new selling price and the price paid for all unsold inventory held by the distributor and reseller 
accordingly  reserves for estimated future returns  exchanges and price protection are provided upon revenue recognition 
total net revenues increased to million in from million in  despite a reduction in royalty and development revenues from million in to million in the decline in royalty revenues in was due to the termination  in the third quarter of  of royalties under the company s first oem agreement with hewlett packard  which related to the licensing of a visioneer hardware and software product  and the termination of royalties under the company s oem agreement with compaq in the first quarter of in regards to the company s second oem agreement with hewlett packard  which involved the licensing of the company s software for hewlett packard scanners  hewlett packard informed the company  in the fourth quarter of  that commencing january   it would no longer be building new scanner products incorporating the company s software 
the company expects royalties from this agreement to decline significantly and ultimately terminate over the next two to three quarters as hewlett packard sells its existing inventory of products incorporating the company s software  which it held at december  net revenues from hardware product sales remained relatively flat at million in compared to million in as a result of the addition of the paperport strobe and the paperport flatbed color scanners in  overall scanner unit sales in increased by nearly over  despite a decrease in grayscale scanner units sales 
the sharp decline in the average retail prices offset the net revenue from the increased hardware units sales from to software revenues increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to the commencement of sales of paperport deluxe software in january total net revenues increased to million in from million in the increase was attributable to several factors the market s increasing acceptance of the company s solutions for paper management systems  new product introductions by the company and increased royalty revenues from its oem partners 
increased product sales and increased royalty revenues contributed nearly equally to the million increase in total net revenues that the company experienced from to the company s ability to grow its revenues will largely depend upon its ability to attain wider market acceptance for its current products  especially its flatbed scanner products and its software products  and its ability to introduce new products with enhanced end user features on a timely basis 
in light of hewlett packard s decision to discontinue bundling the company s software with its scanner products commencing the first quarter of  revenues from royalties will continue to decline unless the company is able to enter into additional oem relationships 
if the company is unable to replace the lost revenue stream from hewlett packard  the company s business  operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
the company s four largest distributors and resellers of its products in were ingram  best buy  office depot and microwarehouse 
sales to these independent distributors and resellers  in the aggregate  accounted for approximately of total net revenues in the four largest distributors and resellers in were ingram  best buy  tech data and merisel 
sales to these independent distributors  in the aggregate  accounted for approximately of the company s total net revenues in the four largest distributors and resellers in were ingram  merisel  microage and tech data 
total sales to these independent distributors  in the aggregate  accounted for approximately of the company s total net revenues in since inception  the company s dependence on any single distributor or reseller has decreased  and is expected to decrease further in as the company actively pursues its strategy to increase and diversify its distribution channels throughout the world 
in  three out of four of the company s largest customers  excluding oems  were resellers  in contrast to  when three out of four were distributors 
the company has focused on establishing direct relationships with major resellers  thus bypassing distributors 
this strategy  to a limited extent  reduces a layer of the company s inventory in the retail channel  thereby reducing inventory risk and increasing channel inventory visibility 
total net revenues from independent distributors outside north america  primarily in europe and the asia pacific regions  were approximately  and of total net revenues in  and  respectively 
net revenues from international sales decreased from million in to million in the reduction in international revenues from to was primarily due to the delayed introduction of japanese localized paperport strobe products  the first of which were shipped in february  and the company s decision to restructure its international sales and marketing operations in may net revenues from international sales increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily attributable to commencement of sales of localized grayscale scanners in japan and growth in the european region 
although the company s international sales are all denominated in us dollars  these sales are subject to a number of risks inherent in doing business on an international level  such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  import and export duties and restrictions  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  and the logistical difficulties of managing multinational operations  any of which could adversely impact the success of the company s international operations 
the growth of the company s international business will depend  in part  on the company s ability to increase awareness of the company s products in international markets 
see item business sales  marketing and distribution 
the introduction of major new products and enhancements of existing products  such as paperport strobe and paperport and paperport  is expected to have a significant impact on the company s quarterly and annual revenues 
as is characteristic of the initial stages of personal computer product life cycles  the company expects that sales volumes of any new product may increase in the first few months following introduction due to the purchase of initial inventory by the company s distribution channel 
thereafter  revenues may stabilize or decline until the end of a product life cycle  at which time revenues are likely to decline significantly  as a result of unit sales and price reductions 
at the end of a product life cycle the company may experience higher rates of return and or increased price protection charges as a result of price reductions this could have a material adverse impact on the company s total net revenues and operating results 
although the company has sought to mitigate the effect of such transition by controlling inventory levels of its distributors and resellers  channel inventory levels are very difficult to quantify accurately  and the company may experience higher than normal rates of return on its older version products and may incur significant price protection charges in connection with its planned release of new paperport products and price reductions in in this regard  receivable allowances increased from million at december  to million at december  due to the inherent uncertainties of product development and new product introductions  the company cannot accurately predict the exact quarter in which a new product or version will be ready to ship 
any delay in the scheduled release of major new products would have a material adverse impact on the company s total net revenues and operating results 
the company has experienced and may continue to experience significant fluctuations in revenues and operating results from quarter to quarter and from year to year due to a combination of factors  many of which are outside of the company s direct control 
these factors include development of the paper input systems market  demand for the company s products  the company s success in developing  introducing and shipping new products and product enhancements  the market acceptance of such products  the company s ability to respond to new product introductions and price reductions by its competitors  the timing  cancellation or rescheduling of significant orders  the purchasing patterns and potential product returns from the company s distribution channels  the company s relationships with its oem partners and distributors  the performance of the company s manufacturing partners and component suppliers  the availability of key components and changes in the cost of materials for the company s products  the company s ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  the timing and amount of research and development and selling  general and administrative expenditures  and general economic conditions 
revenues and operating results in any quarter depend  to a large extent  on the volume  timing and ability to fulfill customer orders  the receipt of which is difficult to forecast 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses is relatively fixed in advance  based in large part on the company s forecasts of future sales 
if sales are below expectations in any given period  the adverse effect of a shortfall in sales on the company s operating results may be magnified by the company s inability to adjust operating expenses to compensate for such shortfall 
accordingly  any significant shortfall in revenues relative to the company s expectations would have an immediate material adverse impact on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company may also be required to reduce prices in response to competition or to increase its spending to pursue new product or market opportunities 
in the event of significant price competition in the market for the company s products  which is anticipated  the company will be required to decrease costs at least proportionately and the company will be at a significant disadvantage with respect to its competitors that have substantially greater resources 
such competitors may more readily withstand an extended period of downward pricing pressure 
in such event  the company will also incur price protection charges from its distributors 
any price protection charges in excess of recorded allowances would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is likely that at some point in the future the company s operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
accordingly  the company s prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies participating in new and rapidly evolving markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in addressing such risks 
total cost of revenues total cost of revenues consists primarily of the costs associated with the purchase of paperport products and related costs of freight  inventory rework  inventory obsolescence and warranty 
for  the company s paperport hardware products were manufactured  assembled and tested by three manufacturing partners  flextronics  nmb and avision 
grayscale sheetfed scanners were manufactured by flextronics  the company s scanning keyboard  paperport ix  and the color sheetfed scanner  the paperport strobe  were manufactured by nmb  and the paperport flatbed scanners were manufactured by avision 
the company s software products were manufactured by dcl  which also packaged and shipped the majority of the company s hardware and software products to its customers 
see item business manufacturing 
total cost of revenues  as a percentage of total net revenues  was in as compared to in the increase was primarily a result of approximately million of charges taken in the first quarter of for write offs and increased reserves relating to excess and obsolete grayscale inventory and cancellation charges relating to adverse purchase commitments for grayscale products 
in addition  the company was unable to realize cost reduction programs fast enough to keep pace with price reductions  which negatively impacted gross margins 
total cost of revenues as a percentage of total net revenues was in as compared to in the increase was primarily a result of charges taken in the fourth quarter of for write offs relating to excess and obsolete inventory and adverse purchase commitments for components and expediting charges relating to the transition of manufacturing paperport products from flextronics  california  to flextronics  china 
due to variations in product mix  pricing actions  and manufacturing related costs associated with product transitions  the company anticipates quarterly fluctuations in its cost of revenue levels in the company s strategy is designed  however  to increase its market share and expand its presence in the price sensitive consumer market place 
this strategy  along with the expectation of continued aggressive pricing environment and product transitions  will continue to put pressure on the company s cost of revenues and gross margins 
the computer and peripherals industry has been characterized by ongoing rapid price erosion and resulting pressure on gross margins 
the company expects that  based on historical trends in the computer and peripherals industry and  in particular  based on the company s recent observations and experiences in the sheetfed and flatbed scanner markets  prices will continue to decline in the future and competitors will offer products which meet or exceed performance and capabilities of the company s products 
the company intends to introduce new hardware designs  software upgrades  accessory products and new software features  in part  to respond to anticipated competitive price pressures and new product introductions 
if prices fall faster than expected by the company  or if the company reduces its prices in order to become or remain competitive or for any other reason  the company may be unable to respond with significant cost reductions  and its gross profit could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the company s gross profit will depend in part on other factors outside of the company s control  including the ability of its manufacturing partners to meet their manufacturing commitments  the success of the company s product transition  competition  the timing and amount of royalties received under its oem arrangements and general economic conditions 
fluctuations in gross profit could have a material adverse affect on the company s financial condition and operating results 
essentially all of the company s hardware manufacturing is concentrated in the far east  with flextronics  in china  nmb  in thailand  and avision  in taiwan 
although this manufacturing strategy has been adopted to help reduce product costs  the company is exposed to certain economic and political risks associated with doing business in this region 
changes in the economic and political climates in the far east may have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist principally of personnel costs  costs of contractors and outside consultants  supplies and material expenses  equipment depreciation and overhead costs relating to occupancy 
as of december   the company employed full time and contract software design engineers  technicians and support staff 
research and development expenses were  and of total net revenues for  and  respectively 
research and development expenses decreased in absolute dollars to million in from million in the decrease was primarily the result of the restructuring of the engineering group in may upon the completion of the paperport strobe project  the research and development team was reduced to a significantly smaller group 
going forward  the company s strategy is to concentrate its engineering efforts on software development  and leverage the hardware and mechanical engineering resources of its manufacturing partners to design its future hardware products 
the paperport and paperport flatbed scanners  introduced in september  were designed in cooperation with the company s manufacturing partner  avision 
research and development expenses increased in absolute dollars to million in from million in the increase in spending was primarily due to the hiring of additional consultants for product development 
the company believes that the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products is essential to its success 
accordingly  the company will continue to invest in research and development activities 
however  such expenses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on a wide range of factors including the status of various development projects 
to date  the company has not capitalized any development costs and does not anticipate capitalizing any such costs in the foreseeable future 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses include personnel and related overhead costs for sales  marketing  customer support  finance  human resources and general management 
such costs also include advertising  commissions to manufacturers representative organizations mros  co op paid to the company s distributors and resellers  trade shows and other marketing and promotional expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in absolute dollars to million in from million in  and also declined as a percentage of total net revenues  to from 
the decrease was the direct result of a company wide restructuring plan implemented in may  in which the company reduced overall headcount and spending by approximately of first quarter levels  and the company abandoned its previous strategy of investing heavily in promoting its brand name and attempting to establish the sheetfed category 
the company believes that these severe spending reductions were necessary in order to reduce the company s cost structure to allow it to compete more effectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars to million in from million in as a percentage of total net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to from 
the increase in spending was primarily attributed to three major factors 
first  the company substantially increased its sales and marketing efforts to create and expand overall market demand and build the company s brand name and product awareness 
second  customer support costs increased significantly as a natural consequence of increased sales  increased installed base  and expansion of distribution to international channels 
finally  an increase in general administration expenses  including employees and expenses  were required to support the company s growing operations 
the company will continue to control selling  general and administrative expenses 
however  if net revenues continue to grow  in order to support the company s growing operations  selling  general and administrative expenses may increase in absolute terms 
such expenses may  fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on a variety of factors  including the timing of the introduction of any new products  expansion of the company s distribution channels  general advertising not related to product introductions and expansion into international markets 
non recurring items the non recurring item in represents the expenses incurred for severance and other charges related to the termination of approximately employees and contract employees in connection with the company wide restructuring plan implemented in may the restructuring actions were fully completed as of december the company expects to realize the benefits of reducing its operating expense levels for the foreseeable future  however such expenses may increase over time in order to support the company s growing operations 
the non recurring item in represents amounts paid to wang laboratories corporation wang in connection with the settlement of a patent matter 
other income  net other income  net  consists primarily of interest earned on cash equivalents and short term investments 
other income  net  was  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in other income  net from to was a result of decreased interest income from significantly lower cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  which were used primarily to fund the company s operating losses 
the net increase from to was primarily the result of an increase in interest income from increased cash equivalents and short term investments made with the application of proceeds from the company s initial public offering in and the subsequent exercise by the underwriters of the over allotment in january taxation at december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal tax purposes and federal tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the company had gross deferred tax assets  including net operating loss and federal tax credit carryforwards  of approximately million  which were fully reserved because of the uncertainty of their realization 
see note of notes to financial statements 
there was no tax provision for  and  due to the net losses incurred  and the company has not recorded a tax benefit from the realization of gross deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of their realization 
liquidity and capital resources through september   the company financed its operations primarily through private placements of equity securities  from which it raised an aggregate of approximately million  net of issuance costs 
in december  the company completed its initial public offering  and raised approximately million  net of issuance costs 
in january  the over allotment option granted to the underwriters in the initial public offering was exercised  resulting in proceeds of approximately million  net of issuance costs 
as of december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million and working capital of million  as compared to million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and million of working capital at december  the company used million of cash for its operating activities for  as compared to million for negative cash flows from operating activities for both periods were attributed primarily to net losses incurred of million and million for and  respectively  offset by non cash charges and changes in working capital 
in  the company used million of cash towards its operating activities  primarily to fund losses of million for the year 
cash provided by investing activities during was million as the company decreased short term investments by million and made capital expenditures of million 
cash used for financing activities during was million as the company increased investments of short term securities by million and made capital expenditures of approximately million 
cash used for financing activities during was million 
short term investments increased by million and capital expenditures were approximately million 
capital expenditures for all three years consisted primarily of purchases of manufacturing tools and molds  computer equipment and software tools 
cash provided by financing activities was million during at december   the company had short term bank borrowings of million  and million was provided by proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the company s employee stock purchase plan and the exercises of stock options 
cash provided by financing activities during was million 
the majority of the cash resulted from the exercise of the over allotment option granted to the underwriters in the december initial public offering 
proceeds  net of underwriting discounts and related expenses  from the january exercise of the over allotment option were million 
cash provided by financing activities during was million 
proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock was million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock  in conjunction with the company s initial public offering  was million 
due to the relatively long manufacturing lead times and inventory pipelines associated with the company s products  as the company introduces and ramps up production of its new products in subsequent quarters  its investment in inventory will continue to represent a significant portion of working capital 
therefore in june  the company negotiated a million line of credit to provide an additional source of liquidity 
the facility is due to expire on june   bears an interest rate of over the prime rate  and provides for a million sub limit on letters of credit 
in december  the facility was amended and temporarily increased to million and the letter of credit sub limit was increased to million until march  as of december   the company had million of short term borrowings and million of letters of credit outstanding under the line of credit  and the company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the agreement 
as of march   the company was in the process of finalizing an amendment to extend the line of credit to march  increase the line of credit to million and extend the sub limit on letters of credit to million 
the company s principal sources of liquidity as of december  consisted of approximately million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and million available under the company s million line of credit 
the company believes that its existing sources of liquidity will provide adequate cash to fund its operations for at least the next twelve months 
thereafter  if cash generated by operations is insufficient to satisfy the company s liquidity requirements  the company may be required to sell additional equity or debt securities  or increase or obtain additional lines of credit 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in additional dilution to the company s stockholders 
year many computer systems experience problems handling dates beyond the year the company has assessed both the internal readiness of its computer systems and the compliance of its scanner and software products sold to customers for handling the year the company does not believe that its computer systems nor its products sold to customers are materially adversely affected by this problem 
in addition  the company is currently assessing the potential impact on the company of the year problem at its manufacturing partners and key vendors
