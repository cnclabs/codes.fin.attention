item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company was incorporated in for the purpose of designing  manufacturing and marketing shuttle and mid size buses 
during the period from its incorporation in to the introduction in of its initial manufactured product  the classic  the company focused its efforts on marketing buses manufactured by other companies 
since the introduction of the classic  the company has experienced significant growth in unit sales and revenues 
the market for the company s products is diverse and broad based 
set forth below are the principal markets identified by the company together with the approximate number of units sold or leased in each market during the periods indicated 
number of units sold or leased market tour and charter companies automobile rental companies hotels motels intracity and rural transit operators parking lot operators retirement long term care facilities airport ground transportation companies other total    the diversity of the customer base from which the company derives its revenue has made the company less vulnerable to economic downturns in a particular market 
additionally  several of the company s larger customers typically rotate their fleets every two to four years which can result in significant orders to the company during their respective purchasing cycles 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected financial information derived from the company s income statements expressed as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated

net revenue increased million or from million in to million in this increase results primarily from the net of increases of approximately million in sales of legacy lj units and million in bus pro sales offset by reductions of approximately million in classic sales and million in eurotrans sales 
an increase in parts sales and extended service agreement revenue accounted for the remainder of the increase in net revenue 
the legacy lj s first full year of sales was the decline in classic sales was affected by production difficulties in the first quarter and by a lower backlog of orders over the third and fourth quarter 
the order backlog for classics was influenced by the company s sales focus on new product introductions rather than by any overall change in the market demand for shuttle buses 
the increase in net revenue from bus pro sales of used buses acquired by the company from trade ins and lease maturities  from million in to million in  resulted from an increase in the used coach selling effort and the increased capability to perform refurbishment on used coaches available for sale 
order backlog for the company at december  was million  including million in orders for the newly introduced irizar century full size motorcoach  compared with million at december  cost of sales and gross profit 
gross profit declined from million in to million in as a percentage of net revenue  gross profit declined from of sales to 
the company experienced uneven production flow and cost inefficiencies during the first quarter and throughout the latter portion of this uneven flow and cost inefficiency resulted in higher than normal materials use and more labor and overhead cost per unit than in the prior year 
the difficulties early in were a continuation of manufacturing issues that arose during the fourth quarter of and included the establishment of a new legacy lj production line  an attempt to produce a record volume of eurotrans  and a reorganization of manufacturing management 
each of these factors had a disruptive effect on the output of the classic production line 
in the latter portion of  output of legacy lj units was slowed when a planned conversion to a different drivetrain chassis was delayed due to late deliveries from the supplier and when a number of engineering redesign issues  such as a redesigned front cap  were implemented 
output of classic units was negatively affected by the lower backlog of orders which resulted in shorter lead times for materials procurement 
isolated shortages of materials caused disruptions in production flow and resulted in higher than anticipated manufacturing costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses and operating income 
operating income declined to million from million in as a percentage of net revenue  operating income declined from in to in selling  general and administrative expenses sg a were million in  up from million in as a percentage of net revenue  sg a rose from in to in the increase in sg a is attributable to a number of factors  including a number of senior management changes and additions during resulting in an increase in compensation expense  relocation and other employment related costs and higher legal expenses incurred in connection with legal matters 
interest expense 
net interest expense increased from  in to million in and resulted primarily from an increase of approximately million in the average level of borrowing under the company s bank credit facility during over and from an approximate additional  in interest charges in over incurred under the ford motor credit corporation ford credit pooled chassis agreement for chassis held on consignment beyond the day interest free period 
compared to net revenue 
net revenue increased million or from million in to million in this increase reflects an increase in the number of units sold and the sales of higher priced units 
the number of units sold in the classic line increased to  in from  in average revenue per classic unit increased to  in from  in unit sales of eurotrans coaches increased to units in from units in while average revenue per eurotrans unit increased to  in from  in the company began selling the legacy lj in net revenue from sales of used buses acquired by the company from trade ins and lease maturities increased million or to million in from million in the increase in sales of used buses resulted from an increase in the used coach selling effort and the increased capability to perform refurbishment on used coaches available for sale 
the company completed construction of a new facility for its used coach operation at yearend and has incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary  bus pro  inc  to continue the expansion of its used coach activities 
the company s investment in the new facility is approximately million 
cost of sales and gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in from million in as a percentage of net revenue  gross profit declined from in to in the reduced gross margin was largely the result of factors affecting the fourth quarter of during which the gross margin of was impacted primarily by a lower margins on sales of eurotrans units to transit customers in spite of record eurotrans unit volume  b inefficiencies in existing production lines causing increases in material  labor and plant overhead costs as well as reduced production volume of the classic line and resulting from the significant unit volume increase in both the eurotrans and legacy lj rear engine product lines as well as from engineering issues related to the newly designed general motors cutaway chassis models  and c uneven production flow of the newly introduced legacy lj resulting from the need to resolve design issues in the custom chassis 
selling  general and administrative expenses and operating income 
operating income increased to million in from million in selling  general and administrative expenses sg a were million in  an increase of over million in as a percentage of net revenue  sg a improved to in from in the increase in sg a resulted primarily from the increase in unit sales and net revenue 
interest expense 
net interest expense increased to  in from  in the relative consistency of interest expense from to is largely the result of average borrowings and interest rates remaining stable during the years 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results the following table presents certain unaudited quarterly results prepared by the company on a basis consistent with its audited financial statements and includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  that the company considered necessary for a fair presentation of the data 
such quarterly results are not necessarily indicative of future results of operations 
this information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report

furthermore  because of the relatively high selling prices of buses and coaches such as those manufactured by the company  a small variation in the number and mix of buses and coaches sold in any quarter can have a significant effect on sales and operating results for that quarter 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations primarily through cash flow from operations  bank borrowings and financing arrangements with ford motor credit corporation ford credit 
net cash of  was used in operating activities during an increase in inventories of million was primarily responsible for offsetting the funds provided by net income  depreciation and a decrease in accounts receivable of approximately million 
the inventory increase resulted largely from an increase in finished goods at december  comprised of a higher than normal level of customer ordered units awaiting delivery and of a build up of demonstrator units during needed in support of new product line sales of the legacy lj  anthem and irizar century 
the million decline in accounts receivable is the result of normal volatility in the timing of shipments and customer payments at a period end 
capital expenditures of million were primarily to purchase manufacturing equipment as well as a store location in orlando  florida and land for potential expansion at the griffin facility 
the capital expenditures and acquisition costs of magnum transportation of  net of the continued decrease in investment in sales type leases substantially accounted for the million net cash used in investing activities 
the company continues to direct its customers to third party financing programs that do not give rise to lease accounting and anticipates its investment in sales type leases to continue to decline 
net cash provided by financing activities of million resulted primarily from a net increase in credit facility borrowing of million as the prior short term line of credit was replaced in september with a multi year facility classified as long term debt 
net cash of  was used in operating activities during with the increases in accounts receivable of million and inventories of million more than offsetting the funds provided by net income  depreciation and amortization 
the increase in accounts receivable results primarily from the significant volume of bus shipments near the end of the year  including the increased activity of yearend sales by the used coach division 
capital expenditures of million  most significant of which is the new facility developed for the used coach division s refurbishment and sales activities  were primarily responsible for the net cash used in investing activities of million 
the increased capital expenditures  however  were partially offset by the declining investment in sales type leases as the company has reduced the volume of sales via leases requiring capital lease treatment 
net cash provided by financing activities of million came primarily from increased borrowings under the company s line of credit of million offset by repayments of long term debt of million 
net cash provided by operations during was  reflecting in part  an increase in accounts receivable of over million more than offsetting million provided by net income  depreciation and amortization 
the increase in accounts receivable was largely the result of the significant volume of bus shipments near the end of the year 
investing activities during the year used  and resulted from capital expenditures of  offset by sales type lease investment activity  both of which were lower than in the prior year 
debt repayments and reductions in collateralized borrowings totalling  were partially funded by  of cash repayments from majority stockholders in connection with the company s initial public offering 
during the third quarter of  the company entered into a new revolving credit facility with its primary bank 
the million  three year unsecured credit facility provides interest rate pricing at reduced spreads over libor that vary based on leverage 
the credit facility is available for general corporate purposes 
at december   the company had  outstanding under this credit facility 
the company has a pooled chassis agreement with ford credit pursuant to which ford credit maintains an inventory of ford chassis at the company s manufacturing facility in griffin  georgia 
ford credit retains title to each chassis until the date the chassis enters the production line at which time the company becomes obligated to purchase the chassis from ford credit 
the time between delivery of the chassis at the company s facility  and the time the chassis enters production is termed the consignment period 
the company is obligated to pay interest at the prime rate plus charged on consigned chassis during any portion of the consignment period that extends beyond days 
the company believes that cash flow from operations and funds available under the company s credit facilities are sufficient to meet the company s funding needs for its present operations for fiscal
