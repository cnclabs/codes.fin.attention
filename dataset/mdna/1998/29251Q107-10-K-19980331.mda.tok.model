the company will continue to require substantial funds to continue its research and development activities and to market  sell and commercialize its technology 
the company believes that its available cash  investments and interest income will be adequate to satisfy its funding operations through early the company will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund its operations thereafter 
the company s capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the problems  delays  expenses and complications frequently encountered by companies developing and commercializing new technologies  the progress of the company s research and development activities  timing of environmental regulations  the rate of technological advances  determinations as to the commercial potential of the company s technology under development  the status of competitive technology  the establishment of biocatalyst manufacturing capacity or third party manufacturing arrangements  the establishment of collaborative relationships  the success of the company s sales and marketing programs  the cost of filing  prosecuting and defending and enforcing patents and intellectual property rights  and other changes in economic  regulatory or competitive conditions in the company s planned business 
estimates about the adequacy of funding for the company s activities are based upon certain assumptions  including assumptions that the research and development programs relating to the company s technology can be conducted at projected costs and that progress towards the commercialization of its technology will be timely and successful 
there can be no assurance that changes in the company s research and development plans  acquisitions or other events will not result in accelerated or unexpected expenditures 
to satisfy its capital requirements  the company may seek additional funding through public or private financings  including equity financings  and through collaborative arrangements 
there can be no assurance that any such funding will be available to the company on favorable terms or at all 
if adequate funds are not available when needed  the company may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of its research and product development programs 
if the company is successful in obtaining additional financing  the terms of such financing may have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or the rights of the holders of the company s common stock
