item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a review of the company s financial position and results of operations for the periods indicated 
the company s consolidated financial statements and supplementary data and the related notes thereto contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general overview the company was organized as a delaware corporation in august in connection with the offering and the related combination of certain entities that held interests in edge joint venture ii the joint venture and the acquisition of direct interests in the joint venture and in certain oil and natural gas properties also owned by the joint venture 
in a series of transactions the combination or combination transactions  the company acquired directly or indirectly of the interests in the joint venture and the calaway interests as defined herein collectively the combined assets by completing i a merger of edge petroleum corporation  a texas corporation old edge  with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of the company in which shareholders of old edge received shares of common stock and old edge became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  ii an exchange of shares of the company s common stock for the general and limited partner interests in edge group ii limited partnership and the limited partner interests in gulfedge limited partnership  iii an acquisition of interests in certain oil and natural gas properties held by mr 
james c 
calaway the calaway interests in exchange for shares of the company s common stock  and iv a purchase of edge group partnership s interest in the joint venture in exchange for shares of the company s common stock 
the company issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock in the combination 
in march  the company completed the offering of  shares of its common stock at a public offering price of per share 
the offering provided the company with proceeds of approximately million  net of expenses 
the company began operations in and until generated exploratory drilling prospects based on d seismic data for sale to other exploration and production companies 
during  as a result of the advent of economic onshore d seismic surveys and the improvement and increased affordability of data interpretation technologies  the company changed its strategy to emphasize exploration based upon the use of d seismic data 
from to  the company reduced its inventory of d based prospects  began limited drilling for its own account and began developing prospects based on d seismic data 
since early  the company has almost exclusively drilled prospects generated from d seismic data  while accelerating its drilling activity and increasing its working interests in new project areas primarily in south texas and louisiana 
the company uses the full cost method of accounting for its oil and natural gas properties 
under this method  all acquisition  exploration and development costs  including certain general and administrative costs that are directly attributable to the company s acquisition  exploration and development activities  are capitalized in a full cost pool as incurred 
the company records depletion of its full cost pool using the unit of production method 
investments in unproved properties are not subject to amortization until the proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until impaired 
to the extent that capitalized costs subject to amortization in the full cost pool net of depletion  depreciation and amortization and related deferred taxes exceed the present value using a discount rate of estimated future net after tax cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves  such excess costs are charged to operations 
once incurred  an impairment of oil and natural gas properties is not reversible at a later date 
impairment of oil and natural gas properties is assessed on a quarterly basis in conjunction with the company s quarterly filings with the commission 
during the three years ended december   no impairments of the company s oil and natural gas properties were deemed necessary 
pursuant to the combination transactions  the owners of the combined assets received all revenues attributable to production and are responsible for all incurred expenses related to the combined assets for all periods prior to march  effective with the combination which was contemporaneous with the closing of the offering  the company is entitled to receive all revenues and is responsible for all expenses related to the combined assets on and after march the joint venture was not a tax paying entity  and the applicable taxes for all periods prior to the combination march  are directly taxable to the individual affiliate owners of the joint venture 
the company s revenues  profitability  future growth and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital  and the carrying value of its properties  are substantially dependent on prevailing prices of oil and natural gas 
it is impossible to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with certainty 
declines in prices received for oil and natural gas may have an adverse affect on the company s financial condition  liquidity  ability to finance capital expenditures and results of operations 
lower prices may also impact the amount of reserves that can be produced economically by the company 
due to the instability of oil and natural gas prices  the company has entered into  from time to time  price risk management transactions eg  swaps and collars for a portion of its natural gas production to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce exposure from price fluctuations 
while the use of these arrangements limits the benefit to the company of increases in the price of natural gas it also limits the downside risk of adverse price movements 
the company s hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of its production and provide only partial price protection against declines in natural gas prices and limits potential gains from future increases in prices 
the company accounts for these transactions as hedging activities and  accordingly  gains and losses are included in oil and natural gas revenues during the period the hedged transactions occur 
effective october   and continuing through january   the company had in place a natural gas commodity collar with a financial institution covering  mmbtus per day  or approximately of the company s daily production 
prices received float between a floor price of per mmbtu and a cap price of per mmbtu  delivered price basis  houston ship channel  with settlement for each calendar month occurring five business days following the publishing of the inside ferc gas marketing report 
total natural gas production marketed under this arrangement was  mmbtu for the year ended december  included within natural gas revenues for the year ended december  was  representing a net gain from current collar activity 
subsequent to december   the company has entered into two additional collar arrangements with a financial institution that begin february  and april   respectively  and expire on april  and june   respectively 
these collar arrangements cover  mmbtus per day with floating floor and ceiling prices ranging between and per mmbtu 
there was no material hedging activity during the years ended december  and results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue and production oil and natural gas revenues increased from million in to million in production volumes for oil increased from  bbls in to  bbls in the increase in oil production increased revenues by approximately million  which was partially offset by an decrease in average oil prices that reduced revenues by approximately  production volumes for natural gas increased from  mcf in to  mcf in the increase in natural gas production increased revenues by approximately million 
a increase in average natural gas prices increased revenues by approximately  the overall net increase in oil and natural gas production was due to new gross  net  producing exploratory and development wells drilled and completed since december  partially offset by normal production declines from existing wells 
during the year ended december  the company marketed its natural gas produced from a certain gas field under the terms of fixed price natural gas contracts 
the terms of these contracts required no minimum volume commitment and provided incremental pricing based on certain levels of production 
total production during net to the company s interest  marketed under these agreements was approximately bcf 
prices received for production marketed under these agreements averaged per mcf for the year ended december  no such contracts existed during included within natural gas revenues for the year ended december  was  representing a net gain from current collar activity 
the collar settlements increased the effective average natural gas prices by per mcf for the year ended december  the following table summarizes production volumes  average sales prices and operating revenues for the company s oil and natural gas operations for the years ended december  and period compared december  to period increase increase decrease decrease production volumes oil and condensate bbls    natural gas mcf    average sales prices oil and condensate per bbl natural gas per mcf operating revenues oil and condensate    natural gas    total    costs and operating expenses oil and natural gas operating expenses increased from million in to million in due to increased production generated from new oil and natural gas wells drilled and completed in oil and natural gas operating expenses on a unit of production basis were per mcfe and mcfe for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease on a unit of production basis is primarily attributable to the disproportionate increase in natural gas production during  which has a lower average production cost per mcfe compared to oil 
depletion  depreciation and amortization expense dd a increased from million in to million in included within dd a for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively  representing depletion expense of oil and natural gas properties 
the increase in depletion expense was primarily due to increased oil and natural gas production  which increased depletion expense by approximately million 
a increase in the overall depletion rate increased depletion expense by approximately  the increase in depletion rate was primarily due to an increase in future development cost for proved undeveloped oil and natural gas properties of approximately million and a bcfe downward revision to prior year oil and natural gas reserve volume estimates 
depletion on a unit of production basis for the years ended december  and was per mcfe and per mcfe  respectively 
the remaining increase in dd a was due primarily to depreciation of new computer hardware and software and office furniture purchased since december   which was partially offset by decreased amortization of deferred loan costs 
general and administrative expense g a increased from million in to million in this increase was attributable to additional administrative staffing and the hiring of additional employees to support the company s increased level of exploration activities  d project generation and other activities 
included as a reduction in g a for the years ended december  and  was approximately  and  respectively  of overhead reimbursements and management fees received from various management  operating and seismic agreements 
general and administrative expenses on a unit of production basis for the years ended december  and were per mcfe and per mcfe  respectively 
the company expects that g a on a unit of production basis to continue to decline as production increases and the rate of increase in g a slows 
unearned compensation expense for the year ended december  was  due to the amortization of unearned compensation expense recognized from restricted stock granted to executives at the completion of the offering 
unearned compensation expense will continue to be recognized in the future  amortized over a vesting period of five to ten years 
interest expense decreased from  in to  in the decrease resulted from the repayment of million of indebtedness on march  with proceeds of the offering 
interest income for the year ended december  was  earned from short term investments purchased from excess proceeds from the offering 
there was no material short term investments purchased during other income in consisted of  of commissions earned to market a property for a third party 
there were no such commissions earned during the year ended december  due to the availability of net operating loss carry forwards and other net deferred tax assets there is no provision for current or deferred taxes for the year ended december  as of december   the company has substantially utilized its available net operating loss carry forward and other net deferred tax assets and should the company have taxable income in future periods a provision for tax expense will be provided 
income tax expense for the year ended december  was  minority interest for the year ended december  was eliminated as result of the completion of the combination on march  in which the company acquired from the predecessor entities of their ownership interests in the joint venture 
for the year ended december   the company had operating income of million as compared to operating income of million in the significant increase in operating income was primarily attributable to higher levels of production from new well additions offset by increases in operating costs and expenses related to the new well additions gross  net and lower average oil and condensate prices 
operating income was further reduced by increased g a attributable to additional administrative staffing and the hiring of additional employees to support the company s increased level of drilling activities 
net income was million  or basic and diluted earnings per share of and  respectively  for the year ended december   as compared to net income of  or basic and diluted earnings per share of for year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue and production oil and natural gas revenues increased from million in to million in production volumes for oil increased from  bbls in to  bbls in the increase in oil production increased revenues approximately  further increased by a increase in average oil prices which increased revenue by approximately  production volumes for natural gas increased from  mcf in to  mcf in the increase in natural gas production increased revenues by million 
a increase in average natural gas prices increased revenues by million 
the increase in oil and natural gas production was due to new gross  net  producing exploratory and development wells being successfully drilled and completed during  which was partially offset by normal production declines from existing wells 
the increases in average oil and natural gas prices were directly attributable to improved overall market conditions

the decrease on a unit of production basis is primarily attributable to the disproportionate increase in natural gas production during  which has a lower average production cost per mcfe compared to oil 
dd a expense increased from  in to million in included within dd a for the years ended december  and was  and million  respectively  representing depletion expense of oil and natural gas property 
the increase in depletion expense was primarily due to improved oil and natural gas production  which increased depletion expense by approximately million 
this was partially offset by a decrease in the overall depletion rate decreased depletion expense by  the decrease in depletion rate was primarily due to a significant increase in oil and natural gas reserve estimates as of december  depletion on a unit of production basis for the years ended december  and was per mcfe and per mcfe  respectively 
the remaining increase in dd a was due primarily to depreciation of new computer hardware and software and office equipment purchased since december  offset by a decrease in the amortization of organizational cost which became fully amortized during g a increased from million in to million in this increase was attributable to additional administrative staffing and the hiring of additional employees to support the company s increased level of drilling activities  d project generation and other activities 
included as a reduction in g a for the years ended december  and  was approximately  and  respectively  of overhead reimbursements and management fees received from various management  operating and seismic agreements 
g a on a unit of production basis for the years ended december  and was per mcfe and per mcfe  respectively 
interest expense increased from  in to  in this increase was primarily due to the repayment of a promissory note in march which reduced the weighted average debt outstanding during  offset by increased borrowings during the second half of and throughout under the revolving credit facility which was partially offset during by a lower average interest rate 
other income in consists of  of commissions earned to market a property for a third party 
there were no such commissions earned in there were no gains on the sale of oil and natural gas property in as compared to a gain of million in the majority of the gain recorded in was attributable to the sale of a proved producing property for million resulting in a gain of million 
the remaining gain was attributable to the sale of an unproved oil and natural gas prospect 
minority interest decreased from  in to  in the decrease was attributable to reduced earnings of the joint venture 
income tax expense for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
net income was  or basic and diluted earnings per share of  for the year ended december  as compared to  or basic and diluted earnings per share of  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources in march  the company completed the offering of  shares of its common stock at a public offering price of per share 
the offering provided the company with proceeds of approximately million  net of expenses 
the company used approximately million to repay its long term outstanding indebtedness incurred under its revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility  subordinated loans and equipment loans

the company had cash and cash equivalents at december  of million  consisting primarily of short term money market investments  as compared to million at december  working capital was million as of december  as compared to  at december  cash flows provided by used in operations were million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the significant increase in net cash provided by operations for the year ended december  as compared to was primarily attributable to higher levels of production from new well additions which was partially offset by increases in operating costs and expenses related to the new successful wells gross  net and lower average oil and condensate prices 
operating cash flows were further reduced by increased g a attributable to additional administrative staffing and the hiring of additional employees to support the company s increased level of exploration activities 
the increase in operating cash flows for the year ended december  as compared to was primarily attributable to an increase in operating income of million  partially offset by an increase in working capital of million and increased interest expense 
the changes in working capital were primarily due to the company becoming an oil and natural gas well operator in late and a significant increase in drilling activities during the year ended december  the increase in cash flows used in was due primarily to the increase in operating loss  which was offset by various changes in balance sheet accounts 
accounts receivable from working interest owners increased  in due to increased drilling activity in which the company was the operator 
accounts payable  trade and accounts payable to related parties increased by  and  respectively 
these increases were caused by increased drilling activity for the company s own account as well as an increase in management fees due a related party which accumulated but had not yet been paid 
during the year ended december   the company continued to reinvest a substantial portion of its cash flows to increase its d project portfolio  improve its d seismic interpretation technology and fund its drilling program 
as a result  the company used million in investing activities during including capital expenditures of approximately million for oil and natural gas property development offset by proceeds from the sale of oil and natural gas prospects of million 
capital expenditures of million were attributed to the drilling of gross wells  of which were successful  with the majority of the remaining capital expenditures representing additions to undeveloped oil and natural gas property  as the company made significant investments in future drilling opportunities 
additionally during  the company purchased shares of preferred stock of frontera at a price of million which are convertible into approximately of the common stock of frontera 
the company may seek overseas direct investment opportunities with frontera and  particularly in latin america  with others

in addition  the company will seek to continue to expand and improve its technological and d seismic interpretation capabilities 
during the year ended december   the company reinvested a substantial portion of its cash flows to increase its d prospect portfolio  improve its d seismic interpretation technology and fund its drilling program 
as a result  the company used million in investing activities during including capital expenditures of million offset by proceeds from the sales of oil and natural gas property of million 
investing activities used million in cash in this change was attributable to a substantial increase in capital expenditures relating to the company s increased exploration activities 
the company s drilling efforts resulted in the successful completion of gross wells in and gross wells in in the company sold one of its proved producing properties and received total cash proceeds from such sale of million 
the company sold another of its proved producing properties for million in these proceeds were used to pay down debt and fund general working capital and corporate needs 
the company also sold several undeveloped oil and natural gas prospects and received cash proceeds of million and million in and  respectively 
cash flows from financing activities in were million compared to million in the significant increase in cash flows from financing activities is attributable to the completion of the company s offering in march offset by repayment of the company s debt 
cash flows from financing activities in were primarily attributable to drawdowns on its revolving credit facility  which were partially offset by deferred offering costs
