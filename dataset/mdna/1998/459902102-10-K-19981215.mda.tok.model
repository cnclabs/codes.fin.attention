fiscal compared to fiscal net income for the year ended september  totaled million or per diluted share compared to million or per diluted share for fiscal continued growth in proprietary systems revenue and increased international product sales  primarily due to acquisitions  were the most significant contributors to the improvement in net income over the prior year period 
revenues and cost of sales fiscal revenues of million improved over fiscal revenues of million 
this improvement resulted from a increase in gaming operations revenues as well as a small increase in product sales 
the company shipped  gaming machines for total product sales revenues of million in fiscal compared to  units for million in the prior fiscal year 
domestic revenues were influenced by a shift in demand to the company s newer  more advanced product lines such as the game king  s plus limited and vision machines 
due to the advanced features and components of these products  they carry a higher average price per unit 
the percentage of new product lines increased to of total domestic units sold for fiscal  compared to in the prior year  resulting in higher average revenue per unit overall 
domestic shipments totaled  units for the year ended september  compared to  units in the year earlier period 
the company maintained its market share in domestic markets where fewer new casino openings and expansions slowed growth in fiscal fiscal domestic shipments included  units to sodak  the company s distributor to native american markets  and  machines shipped to bellagio  mirage resorts newest luxury resort in las vegas 
international unit shipments of  accounted for of total units  the highest percentage in company history  compared to  in fiscal international unit shipments improved due primarily to acquisitions along with improved sales in south africa and latin america

machine shipments in the australia market totaled  units in fiscal  including  olympic machines  compared to  units last year 
the gross margin on product sales was in the current year period compared to in fiscal this fluctuation is the result of an increase in the mix of new product lines  including game king  s plus limited and vision  which have lower gross margin percentages yet higher gross margin dollars 
the gross margin was also impacted by the higher percentage of international sales during which are typically at lower gross margins 
the pace of growth within domestic and international markets is outside the control of the company and has been and continues to be influenced by public opinion and the legal and electoral processes 
the company cannot predict the rate at which domestic and international markets will develop and any slowdown or delay in the growth of new markets will adversely affect the company s future results 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued gaming operations revenue totaled million and million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
this increase was the result of continued popularity of wheel of fortune  strong play on nevada megabucks and the introduction of new systems 
the total installed base of gaming machines operating on the company s megajackpot systems at september  increased to  games on systems from  machines on systems at the end of fiscal joint venture games including wheel of fortune contributed million to total gaming operations revenues

the nevada megabucks jackpot attained record levels in contributing to the year over year improvement in gaming operations revenues 
igt introduced new systems in jurisdictions during the year including slotopoly in nevada and jeopardy in six jurisdictions 
the current year also benefited from a full year of operation of megajackpots in missouri where linked progressive systems were introduced in june the company continues to pursue additional markets  domestically and internationally  for its linked progressive games 
the gross margin on gaming operations revenues was compared to in the prior fiscal year 
this improvement was due primarily to profits from joint venture activities which  for accounting purposes  are reported net of expenses in gaming operations revenues 
however  declining interest rates for the year resulted in higher costs for the interest sensitive assets which the company purchases to fund jackpot payments 
the company anticipates declining interest rates will continue to increase costs of operations into fiscal year expenses operating expenses as a percent of total revenue were in both fiscal and the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses reflects the additional operating expenses of barcrest and olympic 
domestic selling  general and administrative expenses remained consistent with the prior year 
depreciation and amortization expenses totaled million in the current year compared to million in fiscal this increase reflects the amortization of the excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired in the barcrest and olympic acquisitions as well as additional depreciation on the acquired assets

the additional research and development centers in the uk and australia and the company s commitment to new product development domestically contributed to a increase in research and development personnel from the prior year 
bad debt expense declined relative to the prior year as the company aligned the receivable reserve with favorable collection experience 
other income and expense other income and expense decreased million to million for the year compared to million for the prior year 
this decrease is primarily due to increased interest costs of million on the corporate and australian lines of credit due to borrowings related to the acquisitions of barcrest and olympic and treasury stock purchases 
operation of the company s megajackpot systems results in interest income from both the investment of systems cash and from investments purchased to fund jackpot payments 
interest expense on the jackpot liability is accrued at the rate earned on the investments purchased to fund the liability 
therefore  interest income and expense relating to funding jackpot winners are equal and increase at the same rate based on the growth in total jackpot winners 
interest income from investment of systems cash increased million over fiscal as a result of growth in proprietary systems 
the company sold its australian manufacturing and office facility at a gain of approximately million during the year

impact of inflation inflation has not had a significant effect on the company s operations during the three fiscal years in the period ended september  year the year readiness issue  which is common to most businesses  arises from the inability of computer information systems with date sensitive processes to properly recognize and accurately process date sensitive information on and beyond january  if the company or its customers  suppliers  or other third parties fail to make corrections for programs that have defined dates using a two digit year  this could result in system failure or malfunction of certain computer equipment  software  and other devices dependent upon computerized mechanisms that are date sensitive 
this problem may cause disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
assessments of the potential cost and effects of year issues vary significantly among businesses  and it is difficult to predict the actual impact 
recognizing this uncertainty  management has and is continuing to actively analyze  assess  and plan for various year contingencies across the company 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued the company has undertaken various initiatives intended to ensure that its computer equipment and software will function properly with respect to dates in and beyond the year information technology it systems impacted by the year issue include systems commonly thought of as it systems  such as accounting  data processing and telephone pbx systems  as well as systems that are not commonly thought of as it systems  such as alarm systems  security systems  fax machines  mail machines  automated assembly lines  and other miscellaneous systems 
both it and non it systems may contain imbedded technology which compounds the identification  assessment  remediation  and testing efforts 
all subsidiaries of the company will perform the identification  assessment  remediation and testing phases 
however  the company has identified its largest manufacturing locations  igt north america  igt uk  and igt australia as critical operating locations as most other subsidiaries are dependent upon these locations 
igt and igt uk have substantially completed the identification and assessment phases 
igt australia has completed the identification process and is progressing through the assessment phase  which is scheduled for completion by january at this stage  the company believes that its year deficiencies will be remedied through computer equipment and software replacement or modification in a timely fashion 
the company is utilizing both internal and external resources to accomplish its year plan  which began in december and is expected to be substantially complete by june the company estimates that as of november   it had completed approximately of the initiatives necessary to fully address potential year issues 
the remaining project efforts are underway and are anticipated to be completed prior to any currently anticipated impact on its computer equipment and software 
the company engaged third parties to review the igt and igt uk information systems plans and has incorporated the recommendations into the plan 
the company has also initiated efforts to ensure the readiness of its products and services 
as part of its assessment of current products and services  igt is currently upgrading all wide area progressive jackpot system software 
the company has installed the software upgrade in nevada and will submit the software update to regulators for approval in all other jurisdictions in the first quarter of the company is in the process of notifying all of its customers who may have products with year readiness issues and expects this notification to be completed by march igt uses an as for the majority of its software applications  including the manufacturing process  and has identified this as a critical system 
the assessment and remediation efforts on the system have been substantially completed 
the testing phase is expected to be completed by june igt uk is in the process of implementing oracle as an enterprise wide improvement to its information systems and a resolution to year readiness issues 
implementation of this system is expected to be complete by february the company has also surveyed its key vendors and service providers to determine the extent to which interfaces with such entities are vulnerable to year issues 
as of november   the company had received responses from approximately of such third parties  a majority of which have provided assurances that they are either year ready or expect to address all their significant year issues on a timely basis 
a follow up mailing to significant vendors and service providers that did not initially respond  or whose responses were deemed unsatisfactory by the company  is scheduled for the first quarter although the company has developed a system of communicating with vendors to understand their ability to continue providing services and products through the year without interruption  there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which the company may rely will be timely converted or that such failure to convert by another company would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued the company believes that the cost of its year efforts are not expected to exceed million  which will be funded from operating cash flows 
approximately million of this total is for the replacement of non compliant equipment and software which is expected to be capitalized as fixed assets in fiscal as of september   the company had incurred costs of approximately  including the cost of third party reviews 
two of the company s subsidiaries are implementing enterprise wide information system improvements which also resolve year issues 
the cost of implementing these systems has not been included in this cost as the implementations were not initiated specifically to resolve the year issue 
a significant portion of the software remediation costs are not likely to be incremental to the company s results of operations  but rather will represent the redeployment of existing information technology and other resources 
as a result of the redeployment of internal resources for the year remediation efforts  certain enhancements of the company s current systems may be postponed 
the company does not expect the postponement of these enhancements to have a significant impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the year issue presents a number of other risks and uncertainties that could impact the company  including but not limited to third parties whose services we rely upon in order to produce and sell our products  such as key suppliers and customers  public utilities  telecommunication providers  financial institutions  or certain regulators of the various jurisdictions where the company does business  which could result in lost production  sales  or administrative difficulties on the part of the company 
the company believes that the implementation of new business systems and completion of the year project as scheduled  will significantly reduce the risk of significant operating problems with our operating systems  facilities and products 
our year project requires the majority of our application systems to be remedied and tested by june  in those instances where completion by the end of is not assured  appropriate contingency plans are in development or to be determined by the first quarter while the company continues to believe the year issues will not materially affect its consolidated financial position or results of operations  it remains uncertain as to what extent  if any  the company may be impacted 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative factors about market risk market risk under established procedures and controls  the company enters into contractual arrangements  or derivatives  in the ordinary course of business to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange rate and interest rate risk 
the counterparties to these contractual arrangements are major financial institutions 
although the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties  management believes that losses related to counterparty credit risk is not likely 
foreign currency risk the company routinely uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its net exposures  by currency  related to the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations 
the primary business objective of this hedging program is to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies so that gains and losses resulting from exchange rate changes are minimized 
at september   the company had net foreign currency transaction exposure of million of which million was hedged with currency forward contracts 
in addition  from time to time  the company may enter into forward exchange contracts to establish with certainty the us dollar amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency 
given the company s balanced foreign exchange position  a ten percent adverse change in foreign exchange rates upon which these contracts are based would result in exchange gains and losses from these contracts that would  in all material aspects  be fully offset by exchange gains and losses on the underlying net monetary exposures for which the contracts are designated as hedges 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative factors about market risk  continued as currency exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of the company s international businesses into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
the company does not generally hedge translation risks because cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested locally 
igt does not enter into hedges to minimize volatility of reported earnings 
changes in the currency exchange rates that would have the largest impact on translating the company s international operating profit include the australian dollar  british pound and the japanese yen 
management estimates that a change in foreign exchange rates would impact reported operating profit by less than million 
this sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one area may or may not be offset by losses from another area 
interest rate risk the company s results of operations are exposed to fluctuations in the costs of us government securities used to fund liabilities to jackpot winners 
the company records gaming operations expense for future jackpots based on current rates for these us government securities which are impacted by market interest rates and other economic conditions 
therefore  the gross profit on gaming operations decreases when interest rates decline 
management estimates that a decline in interest rates would impact gaming operations gross profit by million 
the company currently does not manage this exposure with derivative financial instruments 
the company uses an interest rate swap to effectively convert floating rate debt in australia to fixed rate debt 
a one percentage point adverse change in the interest rates upon which this contract is based would  in all material respects  be offset by interest expense on the underlying debt
