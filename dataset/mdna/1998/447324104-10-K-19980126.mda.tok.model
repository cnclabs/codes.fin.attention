certain statements made in this report may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of the company or the machine tool industry to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such factors include  among others  i changes in general economic and business conditions that affect demand for cnc control systems  machine tools and software products  ii changes in manufacturing markets  iii innovations by competitors  iv quality and delivery performance by the company s contract manufacturers and v governmental actions and initiatives 
results of operations the following table presents  for the fiscal years indicated  selected items from the consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of worldwide revenues and the year to year percentage changes in the dollar amounts of those items 
percentage of revenues year to year change increase decrease vs 
vs 
sales and service fees gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense net income 
 fiscal compared with fiscal sales and service fees in fiscal decreased million  or  compared with fiscal of the total decrease  million reflected the net effects of translating foreign currency revenues into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
sales of cnc operated machine tools  which totaled million in fiscal  were below the million recorded during fiscal the decrease occurred in the us market  with a decline of million  or  as well as in s 
e 
asia  where the decline of million  or  was most pronounced and reflected the economic turmoil in that region 
sales of cnc operated machine tools in europe increased  or  in spite of the adverse impact of foreign currency translation 
in comparing the fiscal and results  it also should be recognized that the first half of fiscal was marked by an unusually high level of shipments  as the increasing availability of products from the company s contract manufacturers permitted an accelerated reduction of the higher than normal backlog that existed at the end of fiscal sales of cnc systems and software which do not include systems that are sold as an integral part of a machine tool increased during fiscal by  or  primarily due to increased shipments of autobend r control products in response to improved worldwide market demand 
sales of service parts and service fees decreased by  or  compared to fiscal  which is attributable to improvements in recent years in the quality of the company s products along with a transfer to the company s distributors in the united states of responsibility for certain servicing activities 
international sales  including exports from the united states  increased to approximately of consolidated sales for fiscal compared to for fiscal worldwide new order bookings during fiscal were million  an increase of from the million reported for fiscal  in spite of the unfavorable effect of weaker foreign currencies 
new order bookings would have been million  an increase of measured at average fiscal exchange rates constant us dollars 
new orders for cnc operated machine tools increased in units and in constant us dollars 
domestic us machine tool orders increased in units and in dollars which was attributable primarily to demand for the company s proprietary designed inch axis machining center models introduced in late fiscal machine tool orders in europe increased in units and in constant us dollars  also due in large part to demand for the new inch axis models 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in machine tool orders in south east asia of million  or  to less than million in fiscal the company does not expect market conditions in south east asia to improve in the near future 
new orders for cnc systems and software  exclusive of cnc systems and software sold as an integrated component of machine tools  declined million  or  due primarily to reduced orders for the delta series controls from oem customers 
in fiscal  the company plans to expand its product strategy to include marketing axis and axis  oem sourced milling and turning machines featuring fully integrated delta cnc systems 
these machine systems will be sold under the dynapath tm name through the company s subsidiary  autocon technologies  inc backlog at october  was million compared to million at october gross profit percentage  as a percentage of sales  increased to in fiscal  compared to for fiscal net currency translation effects 
the improvement in margin is attributable to the combined effects of an increased percentage of higher margin european shipments in the total sales mix and increased domestic and european shipments of higher margin products introduced in the latter part of fiscal selling  general and administrative sg a expense in fiscal decreased by approximately  or  from fiscal and is primarily the result of translating operating expenses of foreign subsidiaries into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
interest expense for fiscal decreased approximately million  or  from the amount reported for the corresponding period in fiscal  primarily due to a million reduction in outstanding borrowings and the payment during fiscal of  of nonrecurring fees to the company s lenders 
license fee income  net for fiscal  represented approximately of income before taxes compared to in fiscal and was attributable almost entirely to agreements entered into during the year by the company s wholly owned subsidiary  ims technology  inc ims  pursuant to which ims granted fully paid up licenses of its interactive cnc patents in exchange for cash payments by the licensees  substantially all of which was received concurrently with the license grants 
further  under a license agreement with a principal supplier to the company  approximately  is expected to be received in future periods in the form of discounts on purchases by the company  which will be reflected as a reduction of the cost of such purchases 
as of october   additional license fees of approximately million  net of legal fees and expenses  related to future payments under completed license agreements have been deferred and are expected to be recognized in income over the four year remaining life of the licensed patent 
from november  through january   ims has entered into a number of additional license agreements  including agreements with four cnc users which were defendants in the infringement actions brought by ims concerning the us ims interactive machining patent the patent 
these agreements provide for cash payments  substantially all of which is to be received in fiscal these payments are expected to increase income by approximately million  net of legal fees and expenses  in the first quarter of fiscal in addition  one of the agreements is with a supplier to the company and provides for discounts on future purchases of product by the company through december  this agreement  with respect to product discounts  is expected to reduce the cost of such future purchases by approximately  excluding those cnc users that are defendants in the patent infringement actions  there are a limited number of remaining cnc users that ims has identified as potential licensees for the patent 
accordingly  management believes it is unlikely that future license fee income from such other potential licensees would equal that recorded in fiscal for further information  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
the provision for income taxes is almost entirely the result of foreign withholding taxes related to license payments received during the fiscal year 
the income tax liability incurred in the united states and certain other jurisdictions was offset by the reversal of valuation allowance reserves against the company s net operating loss carryforwards 
net operating loss carryforwards available to offset pre tax income in future periods are set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements 
primarily as a result of the substantial licensing fee income received during the period  net income for fiscal increased by approximately million compared to fiscal the increase also reflected the benefits of improved margins and the substantial reduction in interest expense 
fiscal compared with fiscal total sales and service fees of million in fiscal increased million  or  over fiscal  inclusive of a million decrease attributable to weaker european currencies when converting foreign currency revenues into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
on a worldwide basis  sales of cnc operated machine tools totaled million  an increase of million  or  over fiscal  and sales of cnc systems and software which do not include systems and software sold as an integrated part of cnc operated machine tools totaled million  a decrease of million  or  from fiscal the increase in the cnc operated machine tool product line reflected the continued strength of the world s principal machine tool markets  strong demand in europe for the company s advantage series of machine tools  which was introduced in that market in mid and enhanced availability of the company s products for shipment as a result of capacity increases on the part of its contract manufacturers 
the decrease in cnc systems and software sales was primarily the result of decreased shipments of autobend products to original equipment manufacturers  some of whom have developed their own cnc systems 
revenues attributable to sales of parts and service fees increased million  or  from fiscal levels  primarily as a result of increased part sales to support the increase in the installed machine base 
in the united states  sales and service fees in fiscal increased 
million  or  over fiscal reflecting a slight increase in shipments of machine tool products 
increased shipments of delta series control systems for metal cutting machine tools  primarily to original equipment manufacturers  were offset by decreased shipments of autobend control products to the metal fabrication equipment market 
european sales and service fees in fiscal increased million  or  over fiscal  inclusive of the effects of currency translation for financial reporting purposes 
european sales measured in local currency increased 
the improvement was primarily attributable to an increase in unit shipments  without a significant change in margins or average selling prices  aided by a full year of sales of the advantage series product line  continued strength of the european machine tool market and increased availability of products for shipment 
international sales  including export sales  increased to approximately of total consolidated sales for fiscal compared to for fiscal worldwide new order bookings for fiscal were million  a decrease of million  or  from fiscal while international orders increased million  or  in spite of lower foreign currency translation rates  domestic orders declined million  or 
the decline in domestic bookings was due almost entirely due to the fact that domestic machine tool bookings during the first half of fiscal reflected unusually high demand for the just introduced advantage series machine tool line fueled  in part  by distributor anticipation of limited product availability 
the increasing availability of advantage series products for shipment in the second half of fiscal and first half of fiscal enabled the company to assure its domestic customers shorter delivery times  which  along with somewhat slower machine tool demand  contributed to a decline in the order rates 
domestic order bookings in the second half of fiscal approximated that of the comparable period in fiscal due in part to the introduction of new machine tool products in september consolidated backlog at october  was million compared to million at october   reflecting increased availability of products for shipment 
gross profit margin as a percentage of revenues increased to in fiscal from in fiscal despite the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translations for financial reporting purposes 
the increase is the result of an increased percentage of higher margin products in the total sales mix along with the increase in the percentage of total sales attributable to higher margin international sales 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in fiscal increased million  or  over fiscal net of unfavorable currency translation effects 
the increase reflects a  increase in product development expenses  expenditures related to the bi annual international manufacturing technology show imts and increased selling expenses associated with increased unit volume 
the improvement in operating income in fiscal continues the company s trend of improved profitability over the past three years as a result of its completed restructuring program  the introduction of new higher margin products and an improved machine tool market worldwide 
interest expense in fiscal decreased million  or  from fiscal the decrease is the result of a million reduction of debt  reduced interest rates on the company s variable rate bank borrowings  and reduced incremental fees paid to the company s lenders 
the incremental fees  which are non recurring  amounted to  in fiscal and  in fiscal license fee income in fiscal of  net of legal fees and expenses  results from two separate licensing agreements entered into by the company s wholly owned subsidiary  ims technology  inc  with respect to its interactive machining patents 
under the terms of the agreements  additional fees of approximately million  net of legal fees and expenses  are expected to be received in annual installments through fiscal  of which approximately  is expected to be included in income in fiscal the provision for income taxes of  in fiscal relates to the earnings of a foreign subsidiary 
the income tax liability incurred in the united states and certain other jurisdictions was offset by the reversal of valuation allowance reserves against the company s net operating loss carryforwards 
net operating loss carryforwards available to offset pre tax income in future periods are set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements 
year issue the company has assessed and continues to assess the impact of the year issue on its reporting systems and operations 
the year issue exists because many computer systems and applications currently use two digit field codes to designate a year 
as the century date occurs  date sensitive systems will recognize the year as or not at all 
an inability to recognize or properly treat the year could cause the company s systems or those of the company s suppliers to process critical financial and operational information incorrectly 
the company is not aware of any year issue that would have a material adverse effect on its operations 
foreign currency risk management the company manages its foreign currency exposure through the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
the company does not speculate in the financial markets and  therefore  does not enter into these contracts for trading purposes 
the company also moderates its currency risk related to significant purchase commitments with certain foreign vendors through price adjustment agreements that provide for a sharing of  or otherwise limit  the risk of currency fluctuations on the costs of purchased products 
the results of these programs achieved management s objectives in fiscal and fiscal see note to the condensed consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources at october   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at october  cash provided by operations totaled million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal cash flow from operations in fiscal was enhanced by receipts of approximately million of license fees  net of legal fees and taxes received during fiscal  compared to  in fiscal working capital was million at october   compared to million at october  the working capital increase is attributable to an increase of cash of million along with a million reduction in the current portion of long term debt 
accounts receivable decreased million as a result of the decrease in sales and improved collection efforts 
inventory declined million  primarily in purchased parts inventory and is attributed to the company s contract manufacturing program 
the favorable impact on working capital resulting from the reduction in inventory and accounts receivable was almost entirely offset by decreases in accounts payable and accruals 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at october  compared to to at october  capital investments for fiscal consisted principally of expenditures for property  equipment and software development projects 
other investments included  in the second fiscal quarter with respect to hurco automation  ltd 
hal 
as of october   the company has a commitment to invest an additional amount of approximately  in hal through fiscal the company s investment activities were funded through cash flow from operations 
effective september   the company s bank credit agreement and senior notes agreement were amended and restated 
the principal terms of those agreements as amended and restated are set forth below a bank credit agreement the company s bank credit agreement provides for a revolving  unsecured credit facility expiring may   which permits borrowings  at any one time outstanding  of up to million inclusive of outstanding letters of credit of up to million 
of such borrowings  up to million may be drawn in designated european currencies 
interest on all outstanding borrowings will be payable at libor plus an amount ranging from 
to based on a prescribed formula  or at the company s option  prime 
the agreement requires the company to maintain a specified minimum net worth and establishes maximum leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios 
cash dividends and redemptions of capital stock are permitted subject to certain limitations 
the company is required to maintain consolidated tangible net worth as defined of not less than million plus i of cumulative net income subsequent to april  and ii of the net proceeds from sales of capital stock 
total consolidated debt may not exceed of consolidated capitalization defined as total debt plus consolidated tangible net worth 
b senior notes at october   the company had outstanding approximately million of unsecured senior notes  bearing an interest rate of  of which approximately million is due on december  and the balance is due in equal annual installments through effective september   the agreement governing the senior notes was amended and restated on an unsecured basis 
in connection therewith  the interest rate on the senior notes was reduced to from and the financial covenants were amended to conform to those contained in the company s amended and restated bank credit agreement 
outstanding borrowings under the company s bank credit facilities and senior notes were reduced by million during fiscal  primarily as a result of repayments made with cash flow from operations  including license fees 
management believes that cash flow from operations and borrowings under its credit facilities will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
the company was in compliance with all loan covenants at october
