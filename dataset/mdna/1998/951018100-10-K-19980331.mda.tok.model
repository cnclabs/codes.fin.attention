pro forma year ended december  unaudited compared to pro forma year ended december  unaudited the following discussion compares the company s pro forma results of operations for the year ended december  to the pro forma results of operations for the year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from growth in sales of the company s disposable and planned replacement contact lenses  from million to million  along with a moderate increase in the conventional lens product lines of 
sales of disposable and planned replacement contact lenses grew in the us and internationally 
total sales in the united states grew  while sales in the rest of the world grew for the year 
the sales returns and allowances reserve decreased slightly from million at december  to million at december  this is a result of lower actual sales returns and allowances trends which the company experienced throughout the year 
gross profit for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million in the comparable period 
gross profit margin improved to in  reflecting the higher margins realized on the company s disposable and planned replacement lenses due to higher production volumes  as well as cost savings from improved plant utilization and other operating efficiencies 
marketing and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in from million in  largely due to higher promotional spending for all product lines  particularly the former barnes hind conventional lens products  along with higher performance related compensation expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  though  marketing and administrative expenses decreased to in from in income from operations of million for the year ended december  increased from million for the year ended december  due to the overall increase in sales volume along with improvement in the company s gross margin offset slightly by the increase in marketing and administrative expenses 
interest expense  net decreased to million in from million in due to the paydown of debt with proceeds from the offering as well as interest income earned on the promissory note receivable related to the sale of the company s natural touch product line 
other income for the year ended december  includes million of non recurring licensing fee income 
there was no such income in the comparable period 
net income for the year ended december  increased million to million from million for the year ended december  excluding the licensing fee income  net income increased million 
this resulted from higher sales volume and improvement in the company s gross margins  partially offset by increased spending in marketing and administrative expenses 
pro forma year ended december  unaudited compared to pro forma year ended december  unaudited the following discussion compares the company s pro forma results of operations for the year ended december  to the pro forma results of operations for the year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from the following i the company s redefined marketing strategy of repricing and repackaging disposable and conventional lenses to be more competitive  ii the expansion of product offerings in the freshlook line of disposable colored contact lenses  and iii unit volume growth  driven by new marketing programs and the continued penetration of the company s cosmetic lenses 
following the wesley jessen acquisition  the company adopted more stringent return and exchange policies  which lowered product returns and allowances and resulted in generally lower reserve requirements 
the sales returns and allowances reserve increased from million at december  to million at december  this is a result of the addition of barnes hind sales in the fourth quarter of  the conformity of barnes hind reserve methodology to that of the company s and the overall increase in sales volume 
gross profit for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million in the comparable period 
gross profit margin increased to for the year ended december  from in the comparable period 
this improvement reflects the cost savings that resulted from improved plant utilization  personnel reductions and other operating efficiencies 
gross profit for the year ended december  was negatively impacted by a write off of million related to conventional lens inventory produced prior to the wesley jessen acquisition that did not meet new management s higher standards for customer satisfaction 
excluding this effect  gross profit margin for the year ended december  would have been 
marketing and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  however  as a percentage of sales  marketing and administrative expenses decreased to in from in the period 
these increased marketing and administrative expenses are largely due to higher promotional spending and an increase in performance related compensation expenses 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased by million  or to million from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased to from in the prior year 
this decrease is due to the successful completion of manufacturing development projects which became operational in income from operations for the year ended december  increased by million to income of million from million for the year ended december  this increase resulted from the improvement in the company s gross margin resulting from improved plant utilization due to unit volume growth and overall cost reductions  partially offset by increased promotional spending and higher performance related compensation expenses 
other income for the year ended december  increased by million to million in from million in this increase is due primarily to an increase of million in licensing fee income from to  partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange variances recognized in net income for the year ended december  increased by million to million from million for the year ended december  this increase is due to improvement in the company s gross margin offset by higher marketing and administrative expenses 
liquidity and capital resources the company generates significant cash from operations and has adequate borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility to meet its operating and discretionary spending requirements 
net cash provided by operating activities for the period from june  through december  totaled approximately million 
for the year ended december   the company generated approximately million in cash from operating activities  primarily as a result of increases in profitability giving effect to the inventory step up amortization  a decrease in accounts receivable and increases in income taxes payable and accrued liabilities offset by a decrease in accounts payable 
for the year ended december   the company generated approximately million in cash from operating activities  primarily as a result of continued increases in profitability giving effect to the inventory step up amortization and the extraordinary loss  partially offset by working capital requirements and payments under the plan to integrate the barnes hind operations 
since december   the company has reduced its long term debt by million  entirely due to proceeds received from the ipo and the offering 
during the period from june  to december   and for the years ended december  and  the company made capital expenditures of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the majority of these capital expenditures were for facility and equipment improvement  information technology enhancements  and site consolidations 
during barnes hind incurred significant capital expenditures for improvements in information technology and manufacturing efficiencies  including the partial automation of the united kingdom disposable lens manufacturing lines 
the company anticipates future capital expeditures will be incurred to further consolidate locations  enhance the company s management information systems  and to expand production capacity 
the company expects to fund these capital expenditures primarily from cash generated from operating activities and borrowings under its revolving credit facility 
in connection with the wesley jessen acquisition  the company initiated a series of restructuring activities as part of its cost rationalization program 
as part of such acquisition  schering plough agreed to incur significant one time expenses associated with the elimination of approximately positions 
in addition  the company has expended million in cash from june  through december  to close facilities 
as a result of the barnes hind acquisition  the company expects to incur integration costs of approximately million  principally for severance costs and lease expenses on vacated premises 
management expects that this restructuring will be substantially completed by april  as of december   the company has paid million of these integration costs 
as a result of the acquisitions  the company s borrowings under its credit facilities increased significantly as did its liquidity requirements 
as of december   the company had approximately million in borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility portion of the amended bank credit agreement 
the amended bank credit agreement imposes certain restrictions on the company  including restrictions on its ability to incur indebtedness  declare dividends or other distributions  make investments and capital expenditures  grant liens  sell its assets and engage in certain other activities 
in addition  the indebtedness of the company under the amended bank credit agreement is secured by substantially all of the assets of the company  including the company s real and personal property  inventory  accounts receivable  intellectual property and other tangible assets 
management believes that  based on current levels of operations and anticipated internal growth  the company s cash flow from operations  together with other available sources of funds including borrowings under the amended bank credit agreement and available cash on hand at december   of million  will be adequate over the next twelve months to make required payments of principal and interest on the company s indebtedness  to fund anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements  including the aforementioned restructuring and integration costs  and to enable the company and its subsidiaries to comply with the terms of their debt agreements 
however  actual capital requirements may change  particularly as a result of any acquisitions the company may pursue 
the ability of the company to meet its debt service obligations and reduce its total debt will be dependent  however  upon the future performance of the company and its subsidiaries which  in turn  will be subject to general economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  including factors beyond the company s control 
a portion of the consolidated debt of the company bears interest at floating rates  therefore  the company s financial condition is and will continue to be affected by changes in prevailing interest rates 
in december   the company purchased an interest rate cap on million of notional principal amount at a fixed rate of  which expires on december  the cap is intended to provide partial protection from potential exposure relating to the company s variable rate debt instruments 
approximately of the company s net sales for the year ended december  were to international customers and the company expects that sales to international customers will continue to represent a material portion of its net sales 
historically  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had only a minor impact on the company s results of operations and the company does not expect such fluctuations to be material in the foreseeable future 
seasonality historically  the company has experienced limited seasonality  with slightly greater revenues in the quarters ended june and september and slightly lower revenues in the quarters ended march and december

the company expects to adopt this statement in its financial statements for the year ending december other matters the company currently is working to resolve the potential impact of the year on the processing of date sensitive information by the company s management information systems and other computerized systems 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits  rather than four  to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in miscalculations or system failures 
based on preliminary information  costs of addressing potential problems are not currently expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows in future periods 
however  if the company  its customers or vendors are unable to resolve such processing issues in a timely manner  it could result in a material financial risk 
accordingly  the company plans to devote the necessary resources to resolve all significant year issues in a timely manner
