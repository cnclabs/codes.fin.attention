net income gross margin on product sales years ended december  and revenues 
the company s total revenues consist of product sales  which include sales of laser systems and spare parts and service and training  and other revenues  which primarily include revenue from funded development activities performed for customers and for sematech 
revenue from product sales is generally recognized at the time of shipment  unless customer agreements contain inspection or other conditions  in which case revenue is recognized at the time such conditions are satisfied 
funded development contracts are accounted for on the percentage of completion method based on the relationship of costs incurred to total estimated costs  after giving effect to estimates for costs to complete the development project 
product sales increased from million in to million in  primarily due to increased sales of duv photolithography laser systems 
a total of laser systems were sold in compared to laser systems in as a result of the increase in the company s installed base of lasers  the company believes that revenues from spares  replacement parts and services will be an increasingly larger component of product sales 
funded development revenues remained constant at million for and  primarily due to the laser research project sponsored by sematech 
the company expects that funded development revenues will continue to decrease as a percentage of total revenues as the company focuses on product sales 
the company s sales are generated primarily by shipments to customers in japan  the netherlands  and the united states 
approximately  and of the company s sales in   and  respectively  were derived from customers outside the united states 
the company maintains a wholly owned japanese subsidiary which sells to the company s japanese customers 
revenues from japanese customers  generated primarily by this subsidiary  accounted for  and of revenues in   and  respectively 
the activities of the company s japanese subsidiary are limited to sales and service of products purchased by the subsidiary from the parent corporation 
all costs of development and production of the company s products  including costs of shipment to japan  are recorded on the books of the parent company 
the company anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of its net sales 
cost of product sales 
cost of product sales includes direct material and labor  warranty expenses  license fees  manufacturing and service overhead  and foreign exchange gains and losses on foreign currency exchange contracts associated with purchases of the company s products by the japanese subsidiary for resale under firm third party sales commitments 
cost of product sales rose from million in to million in due to the increase in sales volume 
the gross margin on these sales decreased from in to in primarily due to the increase in additional specific warranty reserves of million  an increase in field support overhead costs as the company continued to build its worldwide field support infrastructure in order to provide fast and responsive service to the semiconductor manufacturers  and one time charges associated with bringing the company s new manufacturing facility more fully on line 
warranty reserve expenses are included in cost of product sales as the related sales are reported 
for  an additional specific warranty reserve was expensed to certain lasers previously shipped 
this additional warranty expense was to incorporate changes in these lasers to ensure that they meet the current product configuration and specifications 
the company took a proactive approach to make the necessary hardware and software changes to the laser systems as a preventative maintenance measure to meet performance levels warranted by the company 
these changes are currently in varying stages of implementation 
the gross margin on product sales prior to this specific reserve was for the period ended december  net gains or losses from foreign currency exchange contracts are included in cost of product sales in the consolidated statements of operations as the related sales are recognized 
the company recognized net gains on such contracts of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
research and development 
research and development expenses include costs of internally funded and customer funded projects as well as continuing research support expenses which primarily include employee and material costs  depreciation of equipment and other engineering related costs 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in  due primarily to increased product support efforts associated with the release of the company s series lasers  the hiring of additional technical personnel and the continued development of new laser products 
as a percentage of total revenues  such expenses declined from to in the respective periods due to the growth in the company s revenues 
the company expects that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in as the company continues to invest in the development of new products and product enhancements 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include the expenses of the sales  marketing and customer support staffs and other marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in  due primarily to increased product management and sales support efforts and marketing activities as more lasers were placed in the field over the period 
as a percentage of total revenues  such expense declined from to in the respective periods due to the growth in the company s revenues 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of management and administrative personnel costs  professional services and administrative operating costs 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in  due to an increase in general and administrative support as the company s sales volume  manufacturing capacity  employee recruiting requirements and overall level of business activity increased 
as a percentage of total revenue  such expenses decreased from to in the respective periods 
other income expense net 
net other income expense consists primarily of interest income and expense and foreign currency exchange gains and losses associated with the fluctuations in the value of the japanese yen against the united states dollar 
net other income expense increased from  of net other expense for to  of net other income for  primarily due to the increase in interest income associated with the investment of excess cash  offset by interest expense associated with the convertible subordinated notes issued in and a foreign currency exchange loss for foreign currency exchange gains totaled  interest income totaled  and interest expense totaled  for  compared to a foreign exchange loss of  interest income of million and interest expense of million for the company s results of operations are subject to fluctuations in the value of the japanese yen against the united states dollar 
sales by the company to its japanese subsidiary are denominated in dollars  and sales by the subsidiary to customers in japan are denominated in yen 
the company s japanese subsidiary manages its exposure to such fluctuations by entering into foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge its purchase commitments to the company 
the gains or losses from these contracts are recorded as a component of cost of product sales  while the remaining foreign currency exposure is recorded as other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency translation are accumulated as a separate component of consolidated stockholders equity 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes in was primarily attributable to the growth in the company s pre tax income offset by net operating loss carryforwards from prior years 
the tax provision of million in was primarily attributable to the substantial growth in the company s pretax income partially offset by the reduction of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance carried over from years ended december  and revenues 
product sales increased from million in to million in  primarily due to increased sales of duv photolithography laser systems 
a total of laser systems were sold in compared to laser systems in funded development revenues decreased from million in to million in  primarily due to the completion in of a laser research project sponsored by sematech 
cost of product sales 
net gains from foreign currency exchange contracts included in cost of product sales were  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cost of product sales rose from million in to million in due to the increase in sales volume 
the gross margin on these sales remained relatively consistent at approximately in and research and development 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in  due primarily to increased product support efforts associated with the release of the company s series lasers and the hiring of additional technical personnel 
as a percentage of total revenues  such expenses declined from to in the respective periods due to growth in the company s revenues 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in  due primarily to increased sales commissions and increased sales support efforts and marketing activities associated with the increase in laser sales 
as a percentage of total revenues  such expense declined from to in the respective periods due to the growth in the company s revenues 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in  due to an increase in general and administrative support as the company s sales volume  manufacturing capacity and overall level of business activity increased 
these expenses include a  receivable reserve recorded in  taken in connection with concerns over the collectibility of an accounts receivable with a particular customer 
as a percentage of total revenue  such expenses  including the receivable reserve  increased to of revenue in excluding the receivable reserve  such expenses were of revenue in other income expense net 
net other expense decreased from  in to  in  primarily due to the increase in interest income associated with the investment of the company s proceeds from its common stock offerings in september and december  larger exchange gains against the yen  partially offset by higher interest expense reflective of borrowing requirements for the first nine months of foreign currency exchange gains totaled  interest income totaled  and interest expense totaled  for  compared to   and  respectively  for provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was insignificant in and primarily represented taxes in japan for research and development revenues generated from agreements with seiko 
the tax provision of million in was primarily attributable to the substantial growth in the company s pretax income 
as of december   the company had federal and state tax business credit carryforwards available to offset future tax liabilities of million and  respectively 
such federal and state tax credit carryforwards expire at various dates beginning with the year and  respectively 
to date  inflation has not had a significant effect on the company or its results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  the company has funded its operations primarily through the private sale of equity securities totaling approximately million  borrowings from certain of its investors for bridge financing  bank borrowings  its september  initial public offering  which resulted in net proceeds to the company of approximately million  the public offering on december   which resulted in net proceeds of approximately million  and more recently  raised a net million in a convertible subordinated note offering on august  as of december   the company had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  million in short term investments  million in long term investments  million in working capital and no bank debt 
net cash used in operating activities was approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increases in cash used in operations for the periods ended december   and was primarily attributable to increases in accounts receivable and inventory as the working capital requirements of the company continued to increase due to the expansion of the business during these periods 
net cash used for investing activities was approximately million  million  and million in  and the increase in cash used for investing activities during the periods ended december   and primarily reflects the investment activity of funds received through the company s public offerings in  the convertible subordinated notes offering in and the purchase of computer equipment  test equipment  research and development tools  manufacturing process machinery and tenant improvements to the manufacturing facility in order to accommodate business expansion throughout the periods 
the company s financing activities provided net cash of approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively 
in  the company sold redeemable convertible preferred stock for approximately million  increased its bank borrowings by million and reduced discounting of commercial drafts by  in  the company received net proceeds of approximately million from its two public offerings  received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock and decreased bank borrowings by million 
during the same period  the company reduced discounting of commercial drafts in japan of approximately million 
in  the company issued million in convertible subordinated notes with net costs of million and  in addition  received million in net proceeds for the issuance of common stock and reduced bank debt by million 
the company has available credit arrangements with a bank permitting borrowings of up to million 
these borrowings are unsecured and provide for the following facilities i a million revolving line of credit  and ii a million optional currency line 
the company also has through its subsidiary in japan a billion yen approximately million facility for the receipt of funds from three banks in japan  without recourse  in connection with the discounting of certain commercial drafts received from customers as payment for merchandise 
as of december   billion yen approximately million was being utilized under the facility 
the company also has three foreign currency exchange facilities 
the company had forward foreign exchange contracts at december  to buy million for billion yen 
the total unrecorded deferred gain and premium on these contracts as of december  was million 
on january   cymer announced its board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to million of the company s common stock 
the purchases will be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
the company requires substantial working capital to fund its business  particularly to finance inventories and accounts receivable and for capital expenditures 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of the company s manufacturing expansion  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion of sales and marketing and field service and support  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  and market acceptance of the company s products 
the company believes that it has sufficient working capital and available bank credit to sustain operations and provide for the future expansion of its business during the fiscal year 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 earnings per share 
sfas no 
requires all companies whose capital structures include convertible securities and options to make a dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share 
the new standard became effective for the company for the year ended december  the company adopted this standard as of december  and the financial statements have been restated to reflect the change 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income 
sfas no 
establishes requirements for disclosure of comprehensive income and becomes effective for the company for the year ending december  comprehensive income includes such items as foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized holding gains and losses on available for sale securities that are currently being presented by the company as a component of stockholders equity 
the company does not expect this pronouncement to materially impact the company s results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas no 
establishes standards for disclosure about operating segments in annual financial statements and selected information in interim financial reports 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
this statement supersedes sfas no 
 financial reporting for segments of a business enterprise 
the new standard becomes effective for the company for the year ending december   and requires that comparative information from earlier years be restated to conform to the requirements of this standard 
the company does not expect this pronouncement to materially change the company s current reporting and disclosures 
impact of year issue the company has reviewed its data processing systems as well as computer applications and has determined that the company s data processing will not be materially impacted by any date sensitive calculations related to the year the company has initiated efforts to remedy all currently known situations and expects all programs to be corrected and tested prior to the year the incremental costs of this project will not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
risk factors likely fluctuations in operating results 
the company s operating results have in the past fluctuated and are likely in the future to fluctuate significantly depending upon a variety of factors 
such factors may include the demand for semiconductors in general and  in particular  for leading edge devices with smaller circuit geometries  the rate at which semiconductor manufacturers take delivery of photolithography tools from the company s customers  cyclicality in the market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment  the timing and size of orders from the company s small base of customers  the ability of the company to manufacture  test and deliver laser systems in a timely and cost effective manner  the mix of shipments between new lasers and lower margin replacement parts  the ability of the company s competitors to obtain orders from the company s customers  the entry of new competitors into the market for duv photolithography illumination sources  the ability of the company to manage its costs as it supplies its products in higher volumes  and the company s ability to manage effectively its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  principally with respect to the japanese yen in which sales by the company s japanese subsidiary are denominated 
in addition  the company s operating results may be affected by reductions in customer laser inventories as customers become more efficient at integrating the company s lasers into their photolithography tools 
the company has historically derived a substantial portion of its quarterly and annual revenues from the sale of a relatively small number of systems 
as a result  the precise timing of the recognition of revenue from an order for a small number of systems can have a significant impact on the company s total revenues and operating results for a particular period 
the company s operating results for a particular period could be adversely affected if orders for a small number of systems are canceled or rescheduled by customers or cannot be filled in time to recognize revenue during that period due to  for example  unanticipated manufacturing  testing  shipping or product acceptance delays 
the company s expense levels are based  in large part  on the company s expectations as to future revenues and are  therefore  relatively fixed in the short term 
if revenue levels fall below expectations  net income will be disproportionately and adversely affected 
the impact of these and other factors on the company s revenues and operating results in any future period cannot be forecast with any degree of certainty 
the company believes that semiconductor manufacturers are currently developing capability for pilot production of um devices 
the company also believes that demand for its excimer lasers for duv photolithography tools is currently being driven by the efforts to develop such capability 
once semiconductor manufacturers have acquired such capability  the company believes that they will continue to invest in duv photolithography tools to expand their capacity to manufacture um devices only to the degree to which their sales forecasts and um manufacturing process yields justify such investment 
accordingly  the company currently expects that demand for its duv excimer lasers will be subject to such demand and process development constraints 
recently  the company has significantly increased the scale of its operations and its manufacturing capacity  including hiring additional personnel and substantially increasing the number of systems in production 
this expansion has resulted in higher materials and work in process inventory levels and significantly higher operating expenses  and has required the company to implement a variety of new systems  procedures and controls 
if orders received by the company do not result in sales  or if the company is unable to sustain its revenues at anticipated levels  the company s operating results would be materially adversely affected 
due to the foregoing factors  as well as other unanticipated factors  it is likely that in some future quarter the company s operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would be materially adversely affected 
unpredictability of future operating results 
the company was founded in and shipped its first prototype laser system in although the company s revenues have increased over the last four years  and the company has been profitable for each of the last seven quarters  there can be no assurance that the company s revenues will grow or be sustained in future periods or that the company will be profitable in any future period 
the company s history of annual and quarterly operating losses  its substantial expansion in manufacturing capacity  its limited experience in supplying products in volume and the difficulty of predicting the demand for its products  among other factors  make the prediction of future operating results difficult if not impossible 
risks associated with rapid and substantial manufacturing expansion 
to meet current and anticipated demand for its products  the company must continue to increase the rate by which it manufactures and tests modules  spares and replacement parts for its photolithography laser systems 
although the company has experienced recent success in expanding production  the company has historically been unable to manufacture and test its photolithography laser systems fast enough to fill all orders and has been behind on some of its delivery schedules 
should the company fail to meet delivery orders in the future  customers could cancel orders and seek to meet all or a portion of their needs for illumination sources from the company s competitors 
the company is also increasingly relying on outside suppliers for the manufacture of various components and subassemblies used in its products and is dependent upon these suppliers to meet the company s manufacturing schedules 
the failure by one or more of these suppliers to supply the company on a timely basis with sufficient quantities of components or subassemblies that perform to the company s specifications could affect the company s ability to deliver completed lasers to its customers on schedule 
additionally  the company may underestimate the costs required to increase its manufacturing capacity  which may materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to increasing manufacturing capacity at its facilities in san diego  california  the company has qualified seiko instruments  inc seiko of japan as a contract manufacturer of its photolithography lasers 
while seiko began limited production of lasers for the company in the first quarter of  there can be no assurance that seiko can maintain production on schedule 
the failure of seiko to maintain production on schedule could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
seiko has been advised by komatsu  ltd 
komatsu  a competitor of the company  that certain aspects of the company s lasers might infringe certain patents that have been issued to komatsu in japan and that komatsu intends to enforce its rights under such patents against seiko if seiko engages in manufacturing activities for the company 
in the event that  notwithstanding its manufacturing agreement with the company  seiko should determine not to continue manufacturing the company s products until resolution of the matter with komatsu  the company s ability to meet the anticipated demand for its products could be materially adversely affected 
see uncertainty regarding patents and protection of proprietary technology 
dependence on key suppliers 
certain of the components and subassemblies included in the company s products are obtained from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
in particular  there are no alternative sources for certain of the components and subassemblies  including certain optical components and pre ionizer tubes used in the company s lasers 
in addition  the company is increasingly outsourcing the manufacture of various subassemblies 
although to date the company has been able to obtain adequate supplies of the components and subassemblies used in the production of the company s laser systems in a timely manner from existing sources  the company has only recently commenced volume production of its laser systems  which has caused many of its suppliers to also commence volume production of the company s components and subassemblies 
due to the nature of the company s product development requirements  it is often necessary for key suppliers to rapidly advance their own technologies in order to support the company s new product introduction schedule 
these suppliers may or may not be able to satisfy the company s schedule requirements in providing new modules and subassemblies to the company 
if the company is unable to obtain sufficient quantities of such materials  components or subassemblies  or if such items do not meet the company s quality standards  delays or reductions in product shipments could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on single product line 
the company s only product line is excimer lasers  the primary market for which is for use in duv photolithography equipment for manufacturing deep submicron semiconductor devices 
demand for the company s products will depend in part on the rate at which semiconductor manufacturers adopt excimer lasers as the illumination source for their photolithography tools 
impediments to such adoption include a shortage of engineers with experience implementing  utilizing and maintaining duv photolithography systems that incorporate excimer laser illumination sources  instability of photoresists used in duv photolithography and a shortage of specialized glass used in duv optics 
there can be no assurance that such impediments can or will be overcome  and  in any event  such impediments may materially reduce the demand for the company s products 
in addition  to the extent that such manufacturers are able to produce semiconductors with smaller critical feature sizes by extending the performance capabilities of mercury lamp illumination sources used in existing duv photolithography tools  the demand for the company s products would also be materially reduced 
further  if the company s customers experience reduced demand for duv photolithography tools  or if the company s competitors are successful in obtaining significant orders from such customers  the company s financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
limited production use of excimer lasers 
the company first shipped its lasers for photolithography applications in there can be no assurance that the company s products will meet production specifications over time when subjected to prolonged and intense use in volume production in semiconductor manufacturing processes 
if any semiconductor manufacturer is not able to successfully achieve or sustain volume production using the company s lasers  the company s reputation with semiconductor manufacturers or the limited number of photolithography tool manufacturers could be damaged  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on small number of customers 
the company s primary customer base is composed of a small number of manufacturers of duv photolithography tools 
four large firms  asm lithography  canon  nikon and svg lithography a subsidiary of silicon valley group  inc  dominate the photolithography tool business and collectively accounted for approximately  and of the company s total revenues in   and  respectively 
sales to asm lithography  canon  nikon and svg lithography accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of total revenues in and   and  respectively  of total revenues in the company expects that sales of its systems to these customers will continue to account for substantially all of its revenues in the foreseeable future 
none of the company s customers is obligated to purchase a minimum number of the company s products 
loss of any significant business from any one of these customers or a significant reduction in orders from any one of these customers  including reductions caused by changes in a customer s competitive position  a decision to purchase illumination sources from other suppliers or economic conditions in the semiconductor and photolithography tool industries  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
need to manage a changing business 
the company recently has dramatically expanded the scope of its operations and the number of employees in most of its functional areas 
for example  the company increased the number of its employees from at december  to at december  and to at december  the company installed new management information systems and has also substantially expanded its facilities and manufacturing capacity 
for example  since december  the company has occupied three additional buildings covering approximately  square feet 
if demand for the company s products continues to grow  the company will be required to continue this expansion 
the management of such growth  if such growth occurs  will require the company to continue to improve and expand its management  operational and financial systems  including accounting and other internal management systems  its quality control  delivery and field service and customer support capabilities 
the company will be required to attract  train and retain key technical personnel  including both hardware and software engineers  in order to support the company s growth 
the company will be required to manage effectively its expanding international operations  including the operations of its japan  korea  taiwan  and singapore subsidiaries  its field service and support presence in asia and europe and its relationship with seiko as a manufacturer of its photolithography lasers 
the company must also effect timely deliveries of its products and maintain the product quality and reliability required by its customers 
any failure to manage the company s growth  if such growth occurs  would materially adversely effect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
risks associated with laser warranty  need to increase production of component modules 
the company s growing installed base will require it to increase production of replacement parts and component modules 
because the company prioritizes the reliable operation of its installed units at semiconductor manufacturers above all other requirements  it typically utilizes available component modules first to support existing systems in the field 
accordingly  the failure to rapidly expand production of component modules could result in the delay in shipment of new laser systems  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
need to expand field service and support organization 
the company believes that the need to provide fast and responsive service to the semiconductor manufacturers using its lasers is critical and that it will not be able to depend solely on its direct customers to provide this specialized service 
therefore  the company believes it is essential to establish  through trained third party sources or through its own personnel  a rapid response capability to service its lasers throughout the world 
accordingly  the company is currently expanding its direct support infrastructure in japan  europe  korea  singapore  taiwan and southeast asia 
this expansion entails recruiting and training qualified field service personnel and building effective and highly trained organizations that can provide service to customers in various countries in their assigned regions 
the company has historically experienced difficulties in effectively training field service personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and train qualified personnel to establish these operations successfully or that the costs of such operations will not be excessive 
a failure to implement this plan effectively could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition 
the company currently has two significant competitors in the market for excimer laser systems for photolithography applications  lambda physik and komatsu 
both of these companies are larger than the company  have access to greater financial  technical and other resources than does the company and are located in closer proximity to the company s customers than is the company 
although the company believes that these competitors are not yet supplying excimer lasers in volume for photolithography applications  the company believes that both companies are aggressively seeking to gain larger positions in this market 
the company believes that its customers have each purchased one or more products offered by these competitors and that its customers will continue to actively qualify these competitors lasers in their search for a second source 
if competitors successfully qualify their lasers for use with the company s customers  the company could lose market share and its growth could slow or even decline 
in the future  the company will likely experience competition from other technologies  such as euv  x ray  electron beam and ion projection processes 
to remain competitive  the company believes that it will be required to manufacture and deliver products to customers on a timely basis and without significant defects and that it will also be required to maintain a high level of investment in research and development and in sales and marketing 
there can be no assurance that the company will have sufficient resources to continue to make the investments necessary to maintain its competitive position 
in addition  the market for excimer lasers is still small and immature and there can be no assurance that larger competitors with substantially greater financial resources  including other manufacturers of industrial lasers  will not attempt to enter the market 
there can be no assurance that the company will remain competitive 
a failure to remain competitive would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risk of excessive inventory buildups by photolithography tool manufacturers 
substantially all of the company s customers are photolithography tool manufacturers  which in turn sell their systems to semiconductor manufacturers 
over the past year  the company s customers have substantially increased their forecasted shipments of duv photolithography tools 
the company believes that the increase in competitive demand for duv photolithography tools may have caused and may continue to cause a degree of over ordering of the company s products 
the company is working with its customers to better understand end user demand for duv photolithography tools 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in this regard  or that its customers will not build excessive laser inventories 
excessive customer laser inventories could result in a material decline in the company s revenues and operating results in future periods as such inventories are brought into balance 
dependence on semiconductor industry 
substantially all of the company s revenues are derived from photolithography tool manufacturers that in turn depend on the demand for their products from semiconductor manufacturers 
semiconductor manufacturers correspondingly depend on the demand from manufacturers of end products or systems that use semiconductors 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has historically experienced periodic and significant downturns  which often have had a severe effect on the demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment  including photolithography tools 
the company believes that downturns in the semiconductor manufacturing industry will occur in the future  and will result in decreased demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment 
in addition  the company believes that its ability to reduce expenses in a future downturn will be constrained by the need for continual investment in research and development  and the need to maintain extensive ongoing customer service and support capability 
accordingly  any downturn in the semiconductor industry could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
rapid technological change  new product introductions 
semiconductor manufacturing equipment and processes are subject to rapid technological change 
the company believes that its future success will depend in part upon its ability to continue to enhance its excimer laser products and their process capabilities and to develop and manufacture new products with improved capabilities 
in order to enhance and improve its products and develop new products  among other things  the company must work closely with its customers  particularly in the product development stage  to integrate its lasers with its customers photolithography tools 
there can be no assurance that future technologies  such as euv  x ray  electron beam and ion projection processes  will not render the company s excimer laser products obsolete or that the company will be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to its existing products and processes in a timely manner that satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance 
the failure to do so could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
uncertainty regarding patents and protection of proprietary technology 
the company believes that the success of its business depends more on such factors as the technical expertise of its employees  as well as their innovative skills and marketing and customer relations ability  than on patents  copyrights  trade secrets and other intellectual property rights 
nevertheless  the success of the company may depend in part on patents  and as of december   the company owned united states patents covering certain aspects of technology associated with excimer lasers which expire from january to february and had applied for additional patents in the united states  three of which have been allowed 
as of december   the company had filed patent applications in other countries 
there can be no assurance that the company s pending patent applications or any future applications will be approved  that any patents will provide it with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties  or that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on the company s ability to do business 
in this regard  due to cost constraints  the company did not begin filing for patents in japan or other countries with respect to inventions covered by its united states patents and patent applications until recently and has therefore lost the right to seek patent protection in those countries for certain of its inventions 
additionally  because foreign patents may afford less protection under foreign law than is available under united states patent law  there can be no assurance that any such patents issued to the company will adequately protect the company s proprietary information 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar products  duplicate the company s products or  if patents are issued to the company  design around the patents issued to the company 
others may have filed and in the future may file patent applications that are similar or identical to those of the company 
to determine the priority of inventions  the company may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office that could result in substantial cost to the company 
no assurance can be given that any such patent application will not have priority over patent applications filed by the company 
the company also relies upon trade secret protection  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and other intellectual property protection methods to protect its confidential and proprietary information 
despite these efforts  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to the company s trade secrets or disclose such technology or that the company can meaningfully protect its trade secrets 
the company has in the past funded a significant portion of its research and development expenses from research and development revenues received from photolithography tool manufacturers and from sematech  a semiconductor industry consortium  in connection with the design and development of specific products 
although the company s arrangements with photolithography tool manufacturers and sematech seek to clarify the ownership of the intellectual property arising from research and development services performed by the company  there can be no assurance that disputes over the ownership or rights to use or market such intellectual property will not arise between the company and such parties

the company has in the past been  and may in the future be  notified that it may be infringing intellectual property rights possessed by third parties 
the company s japanese manufacturing partner  seiko  has been notified by komatsu  one of the company s competitors  that certain aspects of the company s lasers might infringe three patents that have been issued to komatsu in japan  and that komatsu intends to enforce its rights under the komatsu patents against seiko if seiko engages in manufacturing activities for the company 
in connection with its manufacturing agreement with seiko  the company has agreed to indemnify seiko against such claims under certain circumstances 
the company has engaged in discussions with komatsu with respect to the komatsu patents  in the course of which komatsu has also identified to the company a number of pending applications and additional patents 
the company  in consultation with japanese patent counsel  has initiated oppositions to the komatsu patents and the applications in the japanese patent office 
however  there can be no assurance that litigation will not ensue with respect to these claims  that the company and seiko would ultimately prevail in any such litigation or that komatsu will not assert infringement claims under additional patents 
any patent litigation would at a minimum be costly and could divert the efforts and attention of the company s management and technical personnel  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that other infringement claims by third parties or other claims for indemnification by customers or end users of the company s products resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted in the future or that such assertions  if proven to be true  will not materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

for this reason  the company is continuing to use the trademark cymer in japan and believes that it will ultimately be permitted to register such mark for use with its products and that it is not infringing the other company s trademark 
there can be no assurance that the company will ultimately succeed in its efforts to register its trademark in japan or that it will not be subjected to an action for trademark infringement  which could be costly to defend and  if successful  would require the company to cease use of the mark and  potentially  to pay damages
