overview the company reported record revenues and earnings for the fiscal year which ended march  revenues for the year increased to approximately million from approximately million in fiscal operating income in fiscal approximated million  or of revenues  versus million and the previous year 
diluted earnings per share in fiscal were a record  an increase of over the recorded in fiscal the company s increased revenues and operating profitability are primarily the result of an improving market and more work opportunities  due in part to the telecommunications act of  a continued focus upon the targeting of residential and commercial premises wiring projects  and a continued emphasis on broadening the company s markets and expanding its customer base beyond the traditional cable television industry 
the following table sets forth for fiscal years and  and the change from fiscal to approximate company revenues from premises wiring services segregated by residential premises wiring services and commercial premises wiring services and from outside plant construction services and approximate premises wiring residential revenues by principal customer group or service 
dollars in millions change fiscal fiscal premises wiring residential msos telco competitive video dbs providers other total residential commercial total premises wiring outside plant total company after deliberation for several years  the telecommunications act of the act was signed into law in february key provisions of the act were designed to enhance competition within the telecommunications industry 
these provisions include allowing telcos to sell video services  and in certain cases  to buy local cable television companies  deregulating cable companies such as allowing them to charge what they wish for many channels once there is effective competition or after three years  permitting rbocs and other lecs to enter the long distance market once certain conditions are met in the local phone market  and allowing long distance providers to enter the local phone business 
since the passage of the act  the federal communications commission fcc and the federal courts  as well as various state governments and agencies  have initiated efforts to define and establish rules for implementation of the act 
although implementation and the intended increase in competition has begun  there have been a number of delays and continuing uncertainties 
the company believes that there has been far more consolidation in the telecommunications industry than the direct competition originally intended or envisioned 
companies appear to be following a belief that size and scale is the best strategy for long term  facilities based telecommunications competition 
overall  the company believes that the impact of the act in increasing competition in the us telecommunications industry could take a number of years to fully develop 
however  the company also believes that the minimal competition thus far fostered by the act has had  and should continue to have  a favorable impact on the company  and that the current telecommunications market still offers substantial premises wiring cabling opportunities 
for example  the company believes that as a result of the act  certain telcos increased their capital expenditures for competitive video systems  and the company has aggressively marketed its services to these companies 
in fiscal  revenues from telephone companies for video communication systems increased to approximately million 
however  revenues from these services declined sequentially in each quarter of fiscal  from approximately million in the first quarter to approximately million in the fourth quarter which ended march  this sequential decline in revenues is due to a number of factors  including a decision by sbc communications  inc to halt construction of a cable project in california in june  this project produced approximately million of revenues in the company s fiscal first quarter  a shift from higher revenue generating underground cabling work orders to lower revenue aerial installation work orders in gte media ventures franchise areas in california  an increase in competition from other cabling service providers for available telco work in certain market areas  an apparent reassessment by telcos with regard to their video strategies of pursuing less costly wireless cable systems dbs and mmds systems in lieu of their current and more costly hybrid fiber coaxial hardwire systems  and weather related problems in the fiscal fourth quarter 
the amount of future capital allocated by these companies to their video programs is largely contingent upon the financial success of these programs  possible new technical developments  and overall strategic decisions by the companies regarding video services 
the company has continued to focus on obtaining residential and commercial premises wiring projects  and to diversify its customer base beyond the traditional cable television industry 
historically  the level of capital spending within the domestic cable industry has largely impacted the company s revenues and results of operations 
the amount of capital spending by cable television msos has been cyclical and has been affected by a number of factors  including perceived or actual government regulation  industry access to financial markets  industry consolidation  and other demands for capital 
in particular  the company has pursued premises wiring opportunities in the commercial network cabling market 
revenues derived from commercial network cabling services in fiscal increased million  or  to approximately million  and reached a record million in the fiscal fourth quarter 
in october  the company successfully completed a public offering of  shares of its common stock 
the company used part of the proceeds to pay in full its outstanding bank debt  and as of march   had in excess of million in cash and cash equivalents and over million in shareholders equity 
the company believes that its strong financial resources allow it to supplement internal growth and sales development efforts with acquisitions and strategic alliances 
the company has sought and intends to continue to seek possible acquisitions or alliances that would augment its existing premises wiring cabling capabilities 
results of operations revenue is generated from cabling projects performed via work orders issued under master contracts 
contract costs may vary depending upon the contract volume  the level of productivity  competitive factors in the local market  and other items 
cost of sales includes subcontractor production costs  materials not supplied by the customer  vehicle and machinery expenses  and business insurance related costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of field employee wages and payroll costs 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues total revenues for fiscal were  compared to  for fiscal  an increase of 
revenues derived from residential and commercial premises wiring activities increased by to a record million in fiscal  versus approximately million in the prior year period 
such revenues accounted for of the company s total revenues for fiscal versus a year earlier  consistent with the company s announced strategy to focus efforts on premises wiring activities 
premises wiring revenues derived from telcos that are building or expanding video systems increased to approximately million of total company revenues in fiscal compared to approximately million of total company revenues in fiscal of the total million of revenues from telcos  approximately million  or of total company revenues  was generated from work orders issued under contracts with gte media ventures  a division of gte

revenues from telcos for video systems declined sequentially in each quarter of fiscal  from approximately million in the first quarter to approximately million in the fourth quarter which ended march  premises wiring sales from cable television multiple system operators in fiscal increased approximately million to million  and commercial network revenues increased million  or  to approximately million 
revenues during the fourth quarter of fiscal were negatively impacted by weather related problems and delays in customer purchase and work authorizations in several market areas 
in may  the company elected to terminate a contract in phoenix  arizona  with a telco due to profitability concerns 
individual project work orders related to this contract generated approximately million in revenues in fiscal  including approximately million in the fourth fiscal quarter ended march  work under this contract is anticipated to be substantially complete by the end of june gross profit gross profit for fiscal was million  or of revenues  as compared to million  or of revenues in the increase in gross margin is due primarily to a decrease in cabling materials expense included in cost of sales as a percent of total company revenues 
the majority of the company s commercial network cabling contracts are turnkey contracts  in which the company provides both the labor and materials necessary for the network installation 
these cabling materials  which are billed at near cost  comprised approximately of total company revenues in fiscal versus approximately in fiscal the percentage decline in cabling materials is primarily due to strong fiscal labor only revenues derived from telcos 
the increase in gross margin is also a result of subcontractor production costs  which decreased as a percent of labor cabling revenues in fiscal contract and project subcontractor costs are dependent upon a number of factors  including pricing for the company s services  the level of productivity  competitive factors in the local market  and other items 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million  or of revenues  as compared to million  or  of revenues for fiscal the company s selling  general and administrative cost structure is maintained at levels necessary to adequately support both anticipated near term revenues and projected longer term revenues 
these anticipated revenue levels and associated cost structures may vary among the company s regional field offices and geographic market areas 
the dollar increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses for fiscal is primarily due to increased employee wages and associated costs incurred to support both current period revenues and anticipated future revenues 
interest expense interest expense was  or of revenues  for fiscal as compared to  or of revenues  for fiscal in october the company used part of the proceeds received from a public stock offering to pay in full its outstanding bank debt of approximately million 
the balance of the proceeds are being invested in short term investment grade securities 
interest income generated from these investments totaled  for the period ended march  see liquidity and capital resources 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues total revenues for fiscal were  compared to  for fiscal  an increase of 
total residential and commercial premises wiring revenues for fiscal increased to approximately million compared to approximately million in fiscal revenues derived from network cabling services increased million or from the million recorded in fiscal to approximately million in fiscal due to increased marketing efforts by the company for these services 
in addition  premises wiring revenues derived from telcos building or expanding video systems increased to approximately million for fiscal compared to approximately million for the fiscal year 
the company believes that as a result of the telecommunications act  certain telcos have increased their capital expenditures for video systems  and the company has aggressively marketed its services to these companies 
outside plant construction revenues for fiscal declined to approximately million from approximately million in fiscal  reflecting management s strategy to increase its emphasis on premises wiring services 
the company recorded sequential increases in revenues during each quarter of fiscal revenues during the fourth quarter of fiscal were negatively impacted by the following lower than anticipated capital spending by its cable television customers in several market areas  delays in the start up of network cabling projects  and unusually severe weather in january gross profit gross profit for fiscal was  or of revenues  as compared to  or of revenues  for fiscal the increase in gross margin for fiscal can primarily be attributed to the emphasis on premises wiring projects over outside plant construction projects 
outside plant construction projects require the use of heavy machinery  specialized trucks  tool systems  and other related construction equipment which reduce the company s gross margin 
in fiscal  the company s overall operating results were negatively impacted by operating losses incurred on a large outside plant construction project in the san diego area 
these operating losses totaled approximately  due primarily to high vehicle  equipment  and production costs  on contract revenues of approximately million 
the company s overall operating results for the first six months of fiscal were negatively impacted by operating losses of approximately  as a result of the company s decision to close its san diego regional office and the completion of remaining outside plant construction projects there 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were  or of revenues  as compared to  or of revenues  for fiscal the dollar increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses for fiscal is primarily due to increased employee wages and associated costs incurred to support both current period revenues and anticipated future revenues 
selling  general  and administrative expenses also include additional amounts for sales personnel engaged in marketing the company s local area network cabling services 
the company s selling  general and administrative expenses during fiscal were also impacted by an unusually large charge to bad debts of  as a result of a customer filing for protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
interest expense interest expense was  or of revenues for fiscal as compared to  or of revenues  for fiscal the dollar increase in interest expense is primarily due to increased borrowings to finance accounts receivable and work in process 
liquidity and capital resources general 
historically  the company s principal sources of liquidity have come from operating cash flow and credit arrangements 
the company s primary requirements for working capital are to finance accounts receivable  work in process and capital expenditures 
pursuant to a typical construction  mdu  or lan cabling contract  work performed by the company is generally not billed to a customer until various stages in a project are complete or until the entire project is complete 
because the company pays its suppliers and subcontractors on a current basis  to the extent that trade payables exceed customer accounts paid at any given time  the company would draw on its revolving credit note to finance its work in process until project work is billed to and paid by the customer 
in october  the company completed a public offering in which it issued  new shares of common stock 
net proceeds from the offering were  before deducting related expenses of  the company paid in full the outstanding balance of its revolving credit note of approximately million and will use the balance of the proceeds for general corporate purposes  including working capital  expansion of sales and marketing activities  openings of new field offices and possible acquisitions of businesses  services or technology complimentary to the company s business 
pending such uses  the proceeds are being invested in short term investment grade securities 
combined accounts receivable and work in process at march  totaled million compared to at march   an increase of million or 
this increase is primarily due to higher revenue levels recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal revenues for all of fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  from the million recorded in fiscal revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal increased to million compared with million in the comparable quarter last year 
the company anticipates that it will continue to receive collections of its accounts receivable in the ordinary course of business 
however  there is no assurance that the company will be able to collect all or substantially all of its accounts receivable outstanding at any time  although the company believes it has adequately provided for potential losses through its allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company s failure to collect substantially all of its accounts receivable and work in process would have an adverse impact on its working capital and could adversely affect its results of operations 
capital requirements are dependent upon a number of factors  including the company s revenues  level of operations  and the type of contracts and work that the company performs 
due to the fact that the company generally has no extended commitments from its customers  it is difficult to forecast longer term revenues and associated capital expenditure and operating cash requirements 
management believes that current cash reserves  cash flow from operations  possible credit from its commercial bank  and funds which may be obtained from the issuance of common stock should provide sufficient capital to meet the reasonably foreseeable business needs of the company 
current credit arrangements 
on march   the company received a commitment from its new commercial bank for a two year million unsecured revolving credit note and terminated its prior credit agreement 
terms of the new credit agreement have not been finalized 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the new credit commitment at march  cash flow from operating activities 
for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million 
this was due primarily to the company s net income and depreciation which totaled million 
these items were somewhat negated by increases in accounts receivable and work in process that were not offset by corresponding increases in trade accounts payable and liabilities to subcontractors 
the company is limited in its ability to offset increases in accounts receivable and work in process through increases in accounts payable or liabilities to subcontractors 
cash used in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal totaled million compared to million for the previous year 
cash used in investing activities is primarily a result of the purchase of property and equipment  which totaled million of revenues and million of revenues in and  respectively 
the increase of million in property and equipment is primarily due to vehicles purchased for new projects in fiscal variability in quarterly results and seasonality the company s quarterly revenues and associated operating results have in the past  and may in the future  vary depending upon a number of factors 
the company has no long term contractual commitments to provide its services 
the contractual commitments which do exist generally can be terminated on days notice 
these contractual commitments do not involve a firm backlog of committed work because the nature of the company s contracts with msos  telcos and dbs providers produce daily work orders only on a project by project basis which must be funded by an approved purchase order 
in addition  network cabling services are generally nonrecurring in nature and are contracted on a project by project basis 
therefore  the amount of work performed at any given time and the general mix of customers for which work is being performed can vary significantly 
consolidation within the telecommunications industry may also delay or depress capital spending  as companies assess their new business plans and strategies and focus on administrative and operational issues associated with their acquisitions or alliances 
the company s operations historically have also been influenced by the budget cycles of the company s customers 
many of the company s mso customers utilize a calendar year budget cycle  funded with quarterly purchase authorizations  which in certain fiscal years has resulted in a lack of availability of funds in the company s third fiscal quarter and has delayed work authorizations in the early part of the calendar year the company s fourth and first fiscal quarters 
telecommunications providers are also subject to actual and potential local  state  and federal regulations that influence the availability of work for which the company may compete 
for example  the company believes that uncertainty regarding pending federal telecommunications legislation decreased capital spending by many of its customers during the fiscal year 
weather may affect operating results due to the fact that construction cabling services are performed outdoors 
weather can also impact the company s premises wiring cabling services due to the limited and lost production associated with poor driving conditions  and soft ground which may prevent underground premises installations  the burying of cable drops  and increased restoration costs 
operating results may also be affected by the capital spending patterns of the company s customers and by the success of various technologies and business strategies employed by them 
in fiscal  the company recorded approximately million or of total revenues for the year in revenues from telcos that are building or expanding video systems 
of the total million of revenues from telcos  approximately million or of total company revenues was generated from work orders issued under contracts with gte media ventures  a part of gte corporation 
the amount of future capital allocated by these companies to their video programs is largely contingent upon the financial success of these programs 
possible new technical developments  and overall strategic decisions by the companies regarding video services 
revenues from telcos for video systems declined sequentially in each quarter of fiscal  from approximately million in the first quarter to approximately million in the fourth quarter which ended march  the company s operating profitability and capacity to increase revenues is also largely dependent upon its ability to locate and attract qualified field managers  project managers  and technical production personnel 
other factors that may affect the company s operating results include the size and timing of significant projects  and the gain or loss of a significant contract or customer 
inflation historically  inflation has not been a significant factor to the company as labor is the primary cost of operations and its contracts are typically short term in nature 
on an ongoing basis  the company attempts to minimize any effects of inflation on its operating results by controlling operating costs and  whenever possible  seeking to insure that selling prices reflect increases in costs due to inflation 
environmental matters the company anticipates that its compliance with various laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment will not have a material effect on its capital expenditures  future earnings or competitive position 
year the year problem arises from the fact that due to early limitations on memory and disk storage many computer programs indicate the year by only two digits  rather than four 
this limitation can cause programs that perform arithmetic operations  comparisons  or sorting of data fields to yield incorrect results when working outside the year range of this could cause computer applications to fail or to create erroneous results unless corrective measures are taken 
incomplete or untimely resolution of the year issue could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  operations or financial condition in the future 
the company has been assessing the impact that the year issue will have on its computer systems  including both hardware and software 
in response to these assessments  which are ongoing  the company has developed and is implementing a plan to develop solutions to those systems found to have date related deficiencies 
the company is also surveying its bank and critical suppliers to determine the status of their year compliance programs 
based upon current available information  the company believes that year compliance should be completed by march assuming that project plans can be implemented as planned  the company believes future costs relating to the year issue  which will be expensed as incurred  will not have a material adverse impact on the company s business  operations  or financial condition 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk through derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments  such as investments in short term marketable securities and long term debt  is not material
