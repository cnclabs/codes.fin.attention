item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations general the company s conventional cheese products  which account for substantially all of the company s sales  are commodity items 
the company prices its conventional cheese products competitively with others in the industry  which pricing  since may  is referenced to the chicago mercantile exchange and was formerly referenced to the wisconsin block cheddar market 
the price the company pays for fluid milk  a significant component of cost of goods sold  is not determined until the month after its cheese has been sold 
while the company generally can anticipate a change in the price of milk  it cannot anticipate the extent thereof 
by virtue of the pricing structure for its cheese and the competitive nature of the marketplace  the company cannot always pass along to the customer the changes in the cost of milk in the price of its conventional cheese 
as a consequence thereof  the company s gross profit margin for such cheese is subject to fluctuation  which fluctuation  however slight  can have a significant effect on profitability 
the company is unable to predict any future increase or decrease in the prices in the chicago mercantile exchange as such markets are subject to fluctuation based on factors and commodity markets outside of the control of the company 
although the cost of fluid milk does tend to move correspondingly with the chicago mercantile exchange  the extent of such movement and the timing thereof is also not predictable as it is subject to government control and support 
as a result of these factors  the company is unable to predict pricing trends 
year ended march  compared to the year ended march  sales for the year ended march  decreased to  from  for the comparable period in  a decrease of  or 
approximately  or of such amount was due to a decrease in the number of pounds of cheese sold and approximately  or of such decrease was due to a decrease in the average selling price for cheese
