item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion should be read in connection with the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
in early  hercules announced several changes in executive leadership and the adoption of alternative strategies intended to strengthen its current businesses 
these measures are designed to improve manufacturing capacity utilization  create operating efficiencies  and eliminate redundant functions 
as a result  the company has shut down certain high cost manufacturing facilities  consolidated redundant manufacturing locations  and initiated work force reductions  with a goal of achieving a more realistic balance between selling prices and volumes 
see note it is the company s goal to substantially complete these programs by mid these actions are expected to have a favorable effect on future before tax earnings in the range of million to million on an annualized basis  beginning in the table below reflects the results of operations on an adjusted basis 
the amounts exclude the results of operations of the aerospace segment  divested in march  the electronics printing division and aroma chemicals business units of the food functional products segment  divested in december and december  respectively  the fibers division joint ventured in june and the ink resins business unit divested in november of the chemical specialties segment  and the composite products division of the corporate and other segment  divested in june additionally  the results exclude the effects of asset rationalizations and impairment  severance  benefits  and other adjustments aggregating million 
see note has been adjusted to exclude million of probable environmental recoveries  a million favorable settlement of an environmental remediation claim reported in the corporate and other segment  and million related to spare part inventories 
has been adjusted to exclude million million in chemical specialties and million in food functional products of selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses  primarily from the early vesting of the and long term incentive compensation programs and the grant of stock awards to all hercules employees  and million of environmental charges  primarily related to the jacksonville site  reported in the corporate and other segment 
the table should make it easier to compare year over year operating results 
accordingly  the discussion that follows speaks to the comparisons in the table through profit from operations 
dollars in millions unaudited net sales    cost of sales    selling  general  and administrative expenses research and development other operating expenses income  net profit from operations net sales by industry segment chemical specialties food functional products corporate and other total    profit from operations by industry segment chemical specialties food functional products corporate and other total results of operations all comparisons are with the previous year  unless otherwise stated 
net sales revenues were relatively flat in while volumes increased on both a consolidated and segment basis 
in the chemical specialties segment  paper chemicals volumes were higher on increased market share of wet strength products  particularly in europe  and increased alkaline size volume associated with stronger industry wide operating rates 
resins volumes were higher on increased demand in the construction  adhesives  and tape markets 
in the food functional products segment  volumes also increased  particularly in water soluble polymer applications in the paint and construction markets 
additionally  fruit and bakery applications contributed to a favorable volume variance in food gums 
these volume improvements were almost completely offset by weaker foreign currencies relative to the dollar and lower prices 
weaker foreign currencies impacted consolidated sales million  or  million  or  in chemical specialties  and million  or  in food functional products 
in  consolidated sales declined million  or 
chemical specialties segment sales declined million  or  while food functional products segment sales declined million  or 
in chemical specialties  lower demand in the construction  adhesives  and tape markets  and unfavorable rates of exchange  were partially offset by increased volume of wet strength and alkaline size products in europe and new paper chemicals business in asia and south america 
in food functional products the decline relates primarily to lower overall volume in construction  oil field  and food markets  coupled with unfavorable rates of exchange  partially offset by favorable pricing in water soluble polymers 
profit from operations consolidated profit from operations decreased million  or  while chemical specialties profits decreased million  or  and food functional products profits increased million  or  in the variances reflect the increased volumes noted above and manufacturing cost improvements  offset by significantly weaker foreign currencies relative to the dollar  which negatively impacted consolidated profit from operations million  or  chemical specialties profits million  or  and food functional products profits million  or 
additionally  chemical specialties profits and margins were adversely affected by higher manufacturing costs at several resins plants  resulting from the introduction of new processes and operability issues  and lower pricing in paper technology  due to competitive pressures 
in  profit from operations increased on both a consolidated and segment basis despite the sales decline 
consolidated profit from operations increased million  or  while chemical specialties profits increased million  or  and food functional products profits increased million  or 
both the chemical specialties and food functional products segments benefited from revisions to long term incentive compensation plans in see note  which reduced sg a expenses  and manufacturing cost improvements  which increased overall gross margins to from 
additionally  the corporate and other segment benefited from lower environmental remediation costs 
hercules anticipates the markets it serves to strengthen in this  along with programs to improve its competitive position and portfolio of products  should result in volume improvements 
however  because the company supplies relatively mature industries  high growth rates will be difficult to achieve 
the economic situation in asia continues to be of concern and the strengthening of the dollar  along with competitive pricing pressures  adds additional challenges in meeting financial goals 
manufacturing cost improvements will continue to be a critical element of success 
equity in income of affiliated companies decreased million in the decline primarily reflects the loss of equity earnings from the company s investments in tastemaker  a owned flavors joint venture  which was monetized in march  and the sale of million shares of alliant techsystems common stock held by the company 
see note as a result  the company s investment in alliant techsystems is no longer accounted for on the equity method 
in  equity earnings increased million  reflecting improved tastemaker earnings and a full year of equity earnings from the company s stake in alliant techsystems  acquired in march in conjunction with the sale of the aerospace segment 
interest and debt expense increased million and million in and  respectively  reflecting higher average debt over the respective periods 
other income expense  net see note  increased million in and decreased million in the increase in reflects the gain on monetization of investments  primarily tastemaker and alliant  and increased interest income  primarily related to the million note received as part of the tastemaker transaction 
see note in  the decrease reflects the gains on the sale of the aerospace segment and electronics printing division in the provision for income taxes reflects effective tax rates of in  in  and in the rate was unfavorably affected by a relatively higher rate on the monetization of the tastemaker and alliant investments  along with required increases to tax reserves related to anticipated tax assessments by federal  state  and foreign tax authorities 
excluding these items  the effective tax rate would have been 
the rate was favorably affected by the use of tax loss carryforwards  while the rate reflects use of foreign tax credits and a state income tax settlement related to a prior year s sale of an investment 
financial condition liquidity and financial resources net cash flow from operations was million in  million in  and million in the decrease in primarily relates to lower trade payables  severance payments see note  and higher legal and environmental spending  partially offset by lower tax payments 
the decrease in primarily relates to higher tax payments and increased working capital requirements 
the higher tax payments in relate to the divestiture of the electronics printing division and payments related to prior years federal income tax audits 
in march  hercules completed transactions to monetize its investment in tastemaker 
according to the provisions of the transactions  hercules received approximately million in cash  subject to post closing adjustments 
see notes and in addition  hercules retained a million  five year note  with an early payment provision of three years  classified as held to maturity 
the net cash value of the transaction to hercules will approximate million 
cash is being utilized to repurchase shares unless and until a more attractive investment appears 
in october  hercules entered into an agreement with alliant techsystems providing for the disposition of million shares of alliant common stock held by hercules for approximately million in cash 
under the agreement  million shares were sold in november for million in cash 
the remaining million shares are subject to a put call arrangement between hercules and alliant and should result in hercules selling the remaining shares to alliant in four equal installments during for aggregate proceeds of approximately million 
total proceeds from asset disposals were million in  million in  and million in in addition to internally generated cash  various credit sources are available to the company 
these include short term lines of credit  of which million was available at december   and revolving credit agreements with several banks providing million  of which million was available at december  in addition  during the year the company increased the amount accessible under shelf registrations from million to million

commitments and capital structure total capitalization stockholders equity plus debt remained relatively flat at billion at december  stockholders equity declined million as share repurchases continued  while total debt increased million 
as a result  total debt as a percentage of capitalization increased to from 
fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates affect the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company uses several strategies to actively hedge interest rate and foreign currency exposure and minimize the effect of such fluctuations on reported earnings and cash flow 
see foreign currency translation and financial instruments and hedging in the summary of significant accounting policies and notes and the discussion below presents the sensitivity of the market value of the company s financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices 
the range of changes chosen reflects the company s view of changes  which are reasonably possible over a one year period 
market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen 
the market values for interest rate risk are calculated by the company utilizing a third party software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on the market conditions as of the valuation date 
the company s derivative and other financial instruments subject to interest rate risk consist of debt instruments  interest rate swaps  and the five year million note received as a result of the tastemaker transaction 
at december   net market value of these combined instruments was a liability of million 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous basis point move in interest rates from their levels at december   with all other variables held constant 
a basis point increase in interest rates would result in a million decrease in the net liability 
a basis point decrease in interest rates would result in a million increase in the net liability 
the market value of the company s portfolio of financial instruments subject to equity price risk at december   was an asset of million 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous change in valuation with all other variables held constant 
a increase or decrease would increase or decrease the asset position by million 
the company s financial instruments subject to foreign currency exchange risk consist of foreign currency forwards and options and represent a net asset position of million at december  the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous change in foreign currency exchange rates from the december  levels  with all other variables held constant 
a strengthening of the us dollar versus other currencies would result in an increase of million in the net asset position  while a weakening of the dollar versus all other currencies would result in a decrease of million in the net asset position 
foreign exchange forward and option contracts are used to hedge the company s firm and anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
thus  there is either an asset or cash flow exposure related to all the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and substantially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis 
there are presently no significant restrictions on the remittance of funds generated by the company s operations outside the united states 
hercules has been identified by us federal and state authorities as a potentially responsible party for environmental cleanup at numerous sites 
the estimated range of reasonably possible costs for remediation is between million and million 
the company does not anticipate that its financial condition will be materially affected by environmental remediation costs in excess of amounts accrued  although quarterly or annual operating results could be materially affected 
see note environmental remediation expenses are funded from internal sources of cash 
such expenses are not expected to have a significant effect on the company s ongoing liquidity 
environmental cleanup costs  including capital expenditures for ongoing operations  are a normal  recurring part of operations and are not significant in relation to total operating costs or cash flows 
hercules is a defendant in numerous lawsuits that arise out of  and are incidental to  the conduct of its business 
these suits concern issues such as product liability  contract disputes  labor related matters  patent infringement  environmental proceedings  property damage  and personal injury matters 
hercules is also a defendant in three qui tam whistle blower lawsuits arising from its aerospace segment  divested in march while it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all pending suits and claims  the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material effect upon the financial position of hercules  and the resolution of any of the matters during a specific period could have a material effect on the quarterly or annual operating results for that period 
see note a quarterly dividend has been paid without interruption since  the company s first year of operation 
the annual dividend of per share during represents a total payout for the year of million 
in december  the company announced an quarterly dividend increase to 
per share  payable march   to shareholders of record on march  during  capital expenditures remained relatively flat at million with of the expenditures related to increased production capacity  compared with in and in the remainder mostly relates to cost savings projects  capacity maintenance  and regulatory requirements 
capital expenditures are expected to approximate million during this amount includes funds for continuing or completing existing projects and new expansion projects  including a methylcellulose upgrade at doel  belgium  and pectin expansions 
other matters in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  and no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  for fiscal years beginning after december  the provisions of sfas no 
establish standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in the financial statements 
this statement requires all items that are required to be recognized under accounting standards as components of comprehensive income be reported in the financial statements and displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements 
the provisions of sfas no 
establish standards for the way that enterprises report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and require that selected information about operating segments in interim financial statements be reported 
it also establishes standards for related disclosure about products and services  geographic areas  and major customers 
hercules is reviewing these new standards of disclosure for adoption in the company recognizes the need to ensure that its operations will not be adversely impacted by year software failures 
software failures due to processing errors potentially arising from calculations using the year date are a known risk 
the company is addressing the year exposure through a discrete cross functional team chartered to identify  evaluate  and remediate noncompliant systems 
in  the company began a process of implementing sap r tm integrated software as an enterprise wide system that will ensure year compliance in core financial systems by based on preliminary information  the cost of remediating problems not covered within the scope of the sap r implementation is not expected to have a material adverse impact on financial position  results of operations  or cash flow 
this annual report includes forward looking statements  as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of  reflecting management s current analysis and expectations  based on reasonable assumptions 
results could differ materially depending on such factors as business climate  economic and competitive uncertainties  higher manufacturing costs  reduced level of customer orders  risks in developing new products and technologies  environmental and safety regulations and clean up costs  foreign exchange rates  and adverse changes in economic and political climates around the world 
as appropriate  additional factors are contained in reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
this paragraph is included to provide safe harbor for forward looking statements  which are not required to be publicly revised as circumstances change
