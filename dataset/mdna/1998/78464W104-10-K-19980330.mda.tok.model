overview the company s revenues are derived from providing hospitals and surgery centers with reusable gowns  towels  drapes  and basins for use in surgical procedures through a daily comprehensive surgical procedure based delivery and retrieval system  and also from the sale of disposable surgical products that supplement its reusable surgical product service

as of december   the company believes its facilities operated at approximately of their estimated aggregate annual revenue capacity of approximately million at current prices 
estimated annual revenue capacity is based on the company s estimate of revenues that would be derived from the full utilization of the facilities at current prices and without addition of equipment 
variations in maximum revenue potential by facility result from differences in product mix and pricing for each facility 
the company s ability to use this excess revenue capacity will depend on its success in substantially increasing its volume of business 
a primary strategy of the company is to increase its operating leverage by expanding revenues within existing markets 
the company amortizes its reusable surgical products on a per use basis  based on estimates of the products useful lives 
sri s purchase of used reusable surgical products in the acquisition at approximately of amsco sterile s net book value has resulted in lower amortization expense since the acquisition 
the company s purchases of new reusable surgical products at current replacement cost increased amortization expense in and will increase future amortization expense 
however  the company s current replacement cost is substantially less than amsco sterile s original cost due to significantly improved sourcing of fabrics
