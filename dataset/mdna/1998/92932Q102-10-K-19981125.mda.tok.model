year compliance the year issue is the result of computer systems that use two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  which may prevent such systems from accurately processing dates ending in the year and beyond 
this could result in computer system failures or disruption of operations  including  but not limited to  an inability to process transactions  to send and receive electronic data  or to engage in routine business and production activities 
the company has completed its initial assessment of all currently used computer and network systems as well as its precision machining production equipment and has developed a plan to correct those areas that will be affected by the year issue 
the company s plan includes replacement or upgrades of certain computer hardware and software 
the company will utilize outside vendors to assist in the upgrade of certain computer systems 
for its precision machining equipment  the company has received written assurance from the equipment manufacturers as to year compliance of their machines 
the company is also developing a limited testing plan that will test the equipment s ability to maintain operations in the year the company estimates that it is complete with respect to its major computer systems and complete with respect to its precision machining equipment in its compliance programs 
the company s goal is to be substantially year compliant by the end of fiscal in addition to reviewing its internal systems  the company has begun formal communications with its significant vendors concerning year compliance 
there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies that interact with the company will be sufficiently year compliant so as to avoid an adverse impact on the company s operations  financial condition and results of operations 
the company does not believe that its products involve any material year risks 
the company presently anticipates that the costs associated with addressing the year issues compliance will not have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity

in addition  the company may be adversely affected by the inability of other companies whose systems interact with the company to become year compliant and by potential interruptions of utility  communication or transportation systems as a result of year issues 
although it expects its internal computer and manufacturing systems to be year compliant as described above  the company intends to prepare a contingency plan that will specify what it plans to do if it or important external companies are not year compliant in a timely manner 
the company expects to prepare its contingency plan during calendar year cautionary statement statements included in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in the letter to shareholders  elsewhere in the annual report  in the company s form k and in future filings by the company with the securities and exchange commission  in the company s press releases and in oral statements made with the approval of an authorized executive officer which are not historical or current facts are forward looking statements
