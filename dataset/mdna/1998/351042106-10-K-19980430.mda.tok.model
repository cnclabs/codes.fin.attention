on june   the company completed a public offering of  shares of the company s common stock at a price of per share 
on july  the company completed the sale of a further  shares pursuant to the underwriters over allotment option 
as a result of the offering the company raised net proceeds of million 
the company maintains three revolving lines of credit with uk banks 
the first line of credit provides for borrowings of up to pound  million and bore interest at per annum on utilized amounts at january  and march  at january    was outstanding under this facility 
the second facility provides for borrowings of up to pound  million 
this facility also bore interest at per annum on utilized amounts at january  and march  at january    was outstanding under this facility 
the third facility provides for borrowings of up to pound  
this facility also bore interest at per annum on utilized amounts at january  and march  at january  this facility was not utilized 
management expects to be able to retain these facilities for the foreseeable future  although no assurances can be given 
the company s french subsidiary maintains revolving credit facilities in the aggregate amount of million 
interest was charged at rates of between and on utilized amounts at january  and march  at january    was outstanding under these facilities 
the company maintains a facility with a uk factoring company  pursuant to which it borrows against eligible trade receivables 
the company pays the factoring company an administrative fee of of eligible trade receivables and interest of per annum at january  and march  at january   million under this agreement was outstanding 
outstanding advances from stockholders are shown on the company s balance sheet as stockholder advances 
outstanding advances as of january  and were  and  respectively 
these outstanding advances do not bear interest and are payable on demand 
the company s working capital decreased from million at january  to million at january   a decrease of million 
this decrease arose primarily from million paid for acquisitions in fiscal net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was million  an increase of million from the net cash used by operations of million in fiscal the net cash provided reflects the net effect of a decrease in accounts payable  accrued liabilities  accounts receivable and deferred revenues and an increase in inventories combined with depreciation and amortization 
net cash used by investing activities in fiscal was million  an increase of million from the million net cash used in fiscal the net cash used primarily reflects the cash paid to acquire firstpoint and eurosystems during fiscal net cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal  a decrease of million for fiscal the decrease is due to the net proceeds from the company s secondary offering in june the cash provided in fiscal reflects primarily the proceeds from the exercise of warrants and proceeds from notes payable and payments of outstanding obligations 
the company believes that the cash flows from operations and borrowing availability under its credit facilities will satisfy the company s anticipated working capital requirements through at least the next twelve months 
in addition  if the company deems it financially attractive  the company may seek to raise additional funds through increased bank borrowings or through the sale of its equity securities 
to the extent the company raises additional capital through the sale of its equity securities  ownership dilution to the company s stockholders will result 
inflation inflation has not had a material effect upon the company s results of operations to date 
in the event the rate of inflation should accelerate in the future  it is expected that costs in connection with the provision by the company of its services and products will increase  and  to the extent such increased costs are not offset by increased revenues  the operations of the company may be adversely affected 
year many existing computer programs use only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
these programs do not consider the impact of the upcoming change in the century 
if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results by the year internally  the company has assessed its year computer issues 
the company estimates that it will have to spend approximately  in the aggregate during fiscal and fiscal to make its major computer systems  and some non critical programs  year compliant 
the company is testing applications and believes that solutions will be implemented timely
