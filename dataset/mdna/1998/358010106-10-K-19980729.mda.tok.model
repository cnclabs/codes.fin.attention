the court unsealed the complaint by order dated december   after fei complained to the united states attorney for the eastern district of new york regarding newspaper articles that charged fei with manufacturing defective products based upon claims in an unspecified and undisclosed qui tam action

bloch on march  and march   respectively 
under the provisions of the false claims act  the government is permitted to take over the prosecution of the action

the complaint demands an unspecified amount of damages allegedly suffered by the government  and asks that the court determine the damages and assess civil penalties as provided under the false claims act  and that the plaintiff muller be awarded a bounty 
under the false claims act  a recovery can be made in favor of the government for a civil penalty of not less than  and not more than  as to each false claim and for each false record and statement  plus three times the amount of damages it is determined the government sustained  plus legal fees and expenses

in addition  fei has instituted a third party action against shhf  robert harris  esq 
and rod kovel  esq  attorneys for muller  in connection with their alleged authoring and publishing of the november letter provided to the government 
the third party complaint asserts the same claims against the attorneys as are asserted in the counterclaims against muller  for libel and product libel  republication of the libel and product libel  slander  tortious interference with contractual relations  prima facie tort and conversion 
the counterclaims and third party complaint have been served

bloch  its former vice president and director  abraham lazar  its secretary treasurer  harry newman and its former contracts manager  marvin norworth 
by letter dated july   fei was notified by the us department of the air force of fei s proposed debarment from government contracting and from directly or indirectly receiving the benefits of federal assistance programs 
the proposed debarment is based upon fei s guilty plea entered in connection with the global disposition and the settlement agreement 
the proposed debarment is effective as of july  and has the following consequences fei s name will be published in the list of parties excluded from federal procurement and nonprocurement programs  a publication of the general services administration containing the names of contractors debarred  suspended  proposed for debarment  or declared ineligible by any agency of the federal government 
proposed debarment is effective throughout the executive branch of the federal government 
offers will not be solicited from  contracts will not be awarded to  exiisting contracts will not be renewed or otherwise extended for  and subcontracts requiring government approval will not be approved for fei by any agency in the executive branch of the federal government unless the head of the agency taking the contracting action or a designee states in writing the compelling reason for continued business dealings between fei and the agency 
fei may not conduct business with the federal government as an agent or representative of other contractors 
no government contractor may award a subcontract equal to or in excess of  to fei unless there is a compelling reason to do so and the contractor first notifies the contracting officer and further complies with certain government regulations 
no agency in the executive branch shall enter into  renew or extend primary or lower tier covered transactions in which fei is either a participant or principal  unless the head of the agency grants an exception in writing 
fei may not act as an agent or representative of other participants in federal assistance programs

a debarment may not be extended solely on the basis of the facts and circumstances upon which the initial debarment action was based 
the debarring official has the authority to reduce the period or extent of the debarment 
based upon applicable government regulations  fei does not believe that the proposed debarment should be for an extended period of time  although fei is unable to predict the period of such debarment

during the fiscal year  the company determined that a writeoff or reserve of million of certain work in progress and component parts inventory related to us government programs was appropriate 
these inventory adjustments result from the company s transformation to a commercial space and telecommunications manufacturer as well as its expectation for reduced procurement volumes by the us government due to both smaller defense department budgets and the government s migration to alternate technologies 
as a result of the building sales coupled with continued operating profits before nonrecurring charges  the company has utilized most of its tax net operating loss carryforward 
in addition  with the settlement of the us government litigation the uncertainty regarding realizability of the company s net deferred income tax asset has been removed thus eliminating the need for a valuation allowance on such amount 
accordingly  during fiscal  the company recorded a deferred tax benefit of million net 
without these significant events  the company s fiscal operating profit  pre tax earnings and net earnings would be materially different from that reported in the financial statements as illustrated below operating profit loss as reported    add back litigation settlement and expenses  inventory writedowns and reserves  adjusted operating profit    other income expense as reported    less gain on building sale  net of expenses  adjusted other income expense    adjusted pretax earnings    operating profit loss operating profit for the year ended april  decreased by million from fiscal without the litigation settlement and the inventory adjustments described above  the operating loss would have been a profit of million or an increase of million over fiscal s results 
this results from the increase in net sales  a relatively constant gross margin rate vs 
and a small decline in selling and administrative expenses 
operating profit for the year ended april   improved by million over the year ended april  this result was achieved through the increase in sales to non us government customers coupled with significant improvement in gross margins due to cost cutting efforts 
reduced selling and administrative expenses and more focused research and development costs  as discussed below  further enhanced the operating results for the fiscal year 
net sales net sales in fiscal increased by million over fiscal with sales to commercial customers increasing by million 
the increasing proportion of commercial sales illustrates the company s successful transformation into a non us government provider of specialty timing devices for commercial space and terrestrial wireless applications 
both fiscal and commercial revenues reflect increasing sales of the company s commercial rubidium product line for application primarily in the cellular telephone industry 
sales of this product line have more than doubled in each of the last three years and are expected to continue to grow at a rapid pace as the company further advances its products into the marketplace 
net sales in fiscal increased by million over fiscal sales to commercial customers for the fiscal year ended april  increased by million over fiscal as the company continued to establish itself as a hardware supplier to the commercial marketplace 
the company believes that its year legacy in building high reliability  precision timing and frequency generation devices for us government programs principally dod and nasa  uniquely positions it to successfully exploit the much greater emerging markets in commercial space and wireless communications 
the company therefore intends to focus its energies on these markets and is phasing out its business with the us government 
however  the company will continue to fulfill its current contractual obligations to us government programs and will make its proprietary technology available for the benefit of our country 
consequently  in fiscal and beyond  the proportion of sales to be generated from us government programs is expected to continue the declining trend 
this will be significantly offset by increasing demands for the company s products in commercial space hardware and terrestrial wireless communications 
gross margins gross margins for the fiscal year ended april  were negatively impacted by the inventory writedowns and reserves described above 
without such charges  gross margins would have been 
during fiscal  the profitability of commercial programs versus us government programs became more distinct 
aggregate gross margins on commercial programs was 
us government programs showed margins of before inventory adjustments and recorded negative margins of after such adjustments 
gross margins for the fiscal year ended april   improved modestly over fiscal year increasing to from 
these results reflect a continuation of the cost reductions and process improvements which were initiated in fiscal these results also reflect the growth in the commercial product lines where margins  in general  are larger than on us government related contracts although the difference in fiscal was not as great as that discussed above for fiscal included in the company s overhead pool  a component of cost of sales  is a charge for amortization of the company s esop program see note to the financial statements 
due to a change in accounting for this program during fiscal  the company recognizes an expense based upon the average market value of the underlying shares of company stock which are allocated to the esop each year 
as a result of the significant increase in the value of the company s stock during fiscal  the charge to esop amortization has also increased significantly  rising to approximately million or of the amount charged to the overhead pool in fiscal this is also primarily a non cash charge  exceeding the actual cash obligation of the company by over  without this excess amortization charge  aggregate gross margins on the company s commercial sales during fiscal would have exceeded 
the impact of this charge in fiscal and was negligible 
if the company s stock value remains at current or higher levels during the next two years  gross margins will continue to be dampened by this additional noncash esop amortization expense 
despite this potential reduction in margins  with the continuing growth in sales of its commercial products  the company anticipates that future gross margins will be significantly higher than that experienced during fiscal selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative costs  excluding the litigation settlement and related costs  declined by  or for the year ended april   over fiscal this decline resulted from reduced litigation related spending during much of the fiscal year  reduced accrual for bonuses and lower deferred compensation expense to certain officers 
these reductions were offset by increased spending for computer system expense and stock based compensation amortization expenses  including  of esop amortization expense see discussion above under gross margins 
the fiscal esop amortization is  greater than the amount recorded in fiscal and exceeds the actual cash outflow by  selling and administrative costs declined by  or for the year ended april   over fiscal this decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in bad debt expense by  after the writeoff in fiscal of certain outstanding receivables 
while provisions for incentive bonuses in fiscal increased in tandem with the improved profitability of the company  this was more than offset by decreases in other compensation related areas such as adjustments in deferred compensation accruals  better than expected growth in cash surrender values of officers and employees life insurance  and lower administrative headcount which was effected in the first quarter of fiscal without regard to bad debt expenses  bonuses and the legal fees related to the government litigation  selling and administrative costs in fiscal were  lower than in this result was achieved through a reduction in the number of personnel  reduced insurance costs  lower usage of professional services and improved operating efficiencies 
as sales increase  the ratio of selling and administrative expenses to net sales is expected to decrease 
as a result of its settlement of all outstanding criminal and civil cases brought by the us government  the company expects the future level of legal costs to be significantly less than that experienced in each of the last three years 
because a smaller proportion of company personnel are included in the selling and administrative category  the proportional impact of increasing esop amortization will be less than that incurred in cost of sales 
research and development expenses the level of effort in company funded research and development projects during fiscal was comparable to that of fiscal with costs decreasing by  from fiscal levels 
such costs reflect the successful development of the rubidium and vsat commercial product lines see item business but do not reflect satellite hardware development costs which were partially funded by customer projects 
while the company retains production rights to any technology which results from customer funded  non recurring engineering efforts  the costs of such development are recorded in cost of sales 
research and development costs in the year ended april   increased by  over fiscal this increase is due principally to costs related to the company s successful commmercial rubidium development efforts 
the company will continue to focus its research and development activities on those commercial projects which it expects will provide the best return on investment and provide the best prospects for the future growth of the company 
for fiscal  the company will make a substantial investment of capital and technical resources to develop generic products for the satellite transponder market 
where possible  the company will attempt to secure partial customer funding for such development efforts but is prepared to spend up to million of its own funds in order to bring such products to the market by the end of fiscal other income expense other income expense for the year ended april   included the million net gain on the sale of the company s real estate holdings 
without such gain  other income expense increased by  over fiscal for the year ended april   other income expense increased by  over fiscal in particular  fiscal investment income increased by  over fiscal and fiscal s income increased by  over fiscal these results were achieved by continuing increases in interest earning assets in fiscal and fiscal such assets grew significantly in the last quarter of fiscal as a result of the net proceeds from the real estate sales 
in addition to interest income  the company also realizes quarterly dividend income on its reit units 
interest rates  which impact the level of investment income  were relatively stable in all three years 
assuming interest rates remain stable  the company anticipates that investment income will increase modestly over the level attained in fiscal interest expense in fiscal decreased by  from fiscal and fiscal expense decreased by  from levels 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company repaid its real estate related loans thus realizing significant reductions in its interest payments 
for fiscal  the reduced interest expense was the result of declining long term debt balances as the company made scheduled principal payments 
as a result of the loan paydowns and a stable interest rate environment  the company anticipates that interest expense will be markedly lower in fiscal when compared to earlier fiscal years 
other income  net  in addition to the net gain on the sale of the company s real estate holdings also included rental income through december under the long term direct finance lease with laboratory corporation of america 
without the one time gain  this category declined by  during fiscal from fiscal and by  from fiscal levels 
this decrease is attributable to the cessation of finance lease income as a result of the sale of the leased property during january as well as additional costs incurred in moving the company s operations to new and more efficient space within the leased back property 
the company anticipates that in future years other income  net  will be an insignificant contributor to pretax earnings 
liquidity and capital resources the company s balance sheet continues to reflect a highly liquid position with working capital of million at april   which is a substantial increase from the working capital position of million at april  this change is principally due to the sale of the company s real estate holdings and the concurrent repayment of long term debt 
included in working capital at april  is million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  including million of reit units which are convertible to reckson associates realty corp 
common stock after january  the company s current ratio at april  is to compared to a to ratio at april  both ratios are below the company s recent historical current ratio of approximately to for year end april   this ratio is due to the accrual of million related to the us government litigation settlement which was paid in june excluding such accrual from both cash and accrued liabilities results in a current ratio of to at april  the lower ratio at april   was due to the classification of the million construction loan  paid in january  as a current liability 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended april   was approximately million compared to million for fiscal this decrease in cash inflow is due to the growth in unbilled receivables of million offset by payments on billed receivables  lower work in process inventories excluding writedowns and reserves and higher accounts payable 
unbilled receivables have grown due to the increased volume in commercial contracts which  in general  do not provide upfront funding as is typical of government related long term contracts 
work in process inventories have decreased as more projects are accounted for on the percentage completion method of revenue recognition 
accounts payable have increased by from the balance at april  due to the timing of the purchases for certain inventory and purchases of capitalizable assets related to relocation of the company s office space within its leased back portion of the building 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended april   was million 
of this amount  million was from the proceeds of the sale of the company s real estate holdings after repayment of the real estate construction loan 
through the real estate sale the company also obtained million of reit units 
such units are convertible into shares of reckson associates realty corp 
common stock after january  and  as such  are treated as a non cash item for fiscal see item properties the company used million net to acquire certain us government and agency securities 
the company may continue to invest cash equivalents in longer term securities or to convert short term investments to cash equivalents as dictated by its investment strategies 
the company also invested  in production equipment which will improve the efficiency of its operations and an additional  was used to obtain new computer hardware and a new telephone system which will improve its financial and operational information systems 
the company will continue to acquire more efficient equipment to automate its production process and intends to spend million to million on capital equipment related to the development and manufacture of new products 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company intends to install the next upgrade of its financial software  the cost of which is not expected to exceed  including the acquisition of next generation personal computers for users 
the purchase of this financial software package two years ago  including the upgrades  has satisfactorily addressed the issue of compliance with the year problem 
the company has determined that additional operational  nonfinancial software must be obtained to resolve the year issue in certain production and support areas  the cost of which will not exceed  net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended april   was  of this amount  million was received in full payment of the mortgage note receivable due from the purchaser of the company s former west coast facility 
in addition  payments of  were received from the sale of shares of common stock from treasury to satisfy the exercise of stock options granted to certain employees and payments of  were received against notes receivable from certain officers and employees 
these inflows were partially offset by million used to retire long term debt and an additional million used to pay semi annual cash dividends to shareholders 
the company will continue to use treasury shares to satisfy the future exercise of stock options granted to officers and employees in previous years 
the company may repurchase shares of its common stock for treasury whenever appropriate opportunities arise but it has neither a formal repurchase plan nor commitments to purchase additional shares in the future 
in addition to the above investing and financing activities  as a result of the building sales in january  the company received reit units with a value of million and used million from the cash proceeds of the lca building sale to pay down the real estate construction loan 
neither of these transactions are reflected in the statement of cash flows 
only the net cash proceeds of the lca building sale are reflected in investing activities 
see item properties the company will continue to expend its resources and efforts to develop hardware for commercial satellite programs and terrestrial wireless communication systems which management believes will result in future growth and continued profitability 
during fiscal  the company intends to significantly increase its development spending to develop generic products for the satellite transponder market 
where possible  the company will attempt to secure partial customer funding for such development efforts but is willing to spend up to million of its own funds in order to bring such products to the market by the end of fiscal internally generated cash will be adequate to fund these development efforts 
at april   the company s backlog amounted to approximately million as compared to the approximately million backlog at april  backlog of commercial and foreign customers approximates million at april  of this backlog  approximately is realizable during fiscal as discussed more thoroughly in item legal proceedings and in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  the company has received a notice of proposed disbarment from receiving contracts from any agency of the us government  except under certain circumstances 
because of the company s transition to commercial products  the continuation of the debarment is not expected to have a material adverse effect on liquidity  financial condition or results of operations 
certain nongovernment initiated civil cases remain outstanding and the company is unable to determine the ultimate disposition of such cases 
any disposition is not expected to have a material effect on the company s liquidity or financial condition 
the company also has available for income tax purposes  approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards which may be applied against future taxable income 
other matters see discussion of recently issued pronouncements included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the financial information reported herein is not necessarily indicative of future operating results orof the future financial condition of registrant 
except as noted  management is unaware of any impending transactions or events that are likely to have a material adverse effect on results from operations 
inflation during fiscal  as in the two prior fiscal years  the impact of inflation on the registrant s business has not been materially significant
