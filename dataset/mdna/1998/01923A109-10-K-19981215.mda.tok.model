item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the company changed its fiscal year to end on september from october effective for fiscal this resulted in an eleven month reporting period for the period ended september  the company is a provider of a broad range of home health care services and products with operations in the us and the us the company provides the following services and products to patients in their homes i specialty mail order pharmaceuticals  medical supplies  respiratory therapy and home medical equipment  ii patient services  including home nursing and para professional services  and iii infusion therapy 
the company s us infusion and respiratory therapy services and home medical equipment operations are concentrated in new jersey and new york while its specialty mail order pharmaceutical and medical supplies operations provide products to patients nationwide and in puerto rico 
the company s uk operations include the second largest commercial provider of home nursing and para professional care  the uk s second largest respiratory supplier as well as a leading medical supplies distributor all with operations located throughout the uk the company has made significant strides toward becoming one of the only integrated national providers of home and alternative site health care in the uk through the purchases of omnicare for approximately  and allied for approximately  omnicare provides respiratory equipment and services and supplies a range of medical and surgical products to patients at home throughout the uk through its network of seven regional facilities 
allied is a national provider of nursing and other care giving services to home care patients with locations throughout the uk the company intends to utilize its recently acquired uk operations as a platform to introduce new products and services to the uk market which have already been widely accepted in the us  as well as for add on acquisitions 
the company believes the uk home health care market is less developed than in the us and presents a significant opportunity to leverage its existing expertise in home health care 
the company took a number of significant steps during the fiscal year ended september  and the eleven month period to realign its business as a focused regional home health care provider and specialty pharmacy and medical supply distributor in the us and as an integrated national provider of home and alternate site health care products and services in the uk these steps included i selling non core assets such as the company s radamerica business which provided radiation therapy in the baltimore  maryland area and the company s tni operations  which provided nursing and para professional services in new jersey and florida  ii exiting businesses that were deemed not to have the potential to earn an adequate return on capital over the long term such as wound care and orthotic product lines in the continental us  as well as the company s pulmonary rehabilitation center in cherry hill  new jersey  iii completing the hmi asset sale  and iv terminating the agreements to purchase the vip companies 
the company s revenue mix and payor mix will be influenced to a significant degree by the relative contribution of acquired businesses and their respective payor profiles 
assuming the company owned of omnicare and allied on november   the products and services offered by these companies would have accounted for approximately of the combined pro forma revenue  for the eleven month period 
the following table shows the percentage of historical net revenues represented by each of the company s product lines eleven months year ended ended year ended september  september  october  product line net respiratory  medical equipment and supplies sales net patient services net infusion services total revenues the increase in net patient services and a corresponding decline in net respiratory  medical equipment and supplies sales and net infusion services as a percentage of total revenues from the year ended october  to the eleven month period and from the eleven month period to the year ended september  resulted primarily from the acquisition of allied effective june  
subsequent acquisitions  when completed  will continue to impact the relative mix of revenues 
on a pro forma basis  assuming the company owned of omnicare and allied on november   the percentage of total revenues for the eleven months ended september  would have been as follows net respiratory  medical equipment and supplies sales  net patient services  and net infusion services 
the following table shows the payor mix for the company s total revenues for the periods presented eleven months year ended ended year ended september  september  october  payor medicare medicaid private payors uk nhs and other governmental payors total revenues the decrease in medicare as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended september  as compared to the eleven month period and the eleven month period as compared to fiscal is primarily a result of the omnicare and allied acquisitions 
the company believes that its payor mix in the future will be determined primarily by the payor profile of completed acquisitions and  to a lesser extent  from shifts in existing business among payors 
on a pro forma basis  assuming the company owned of omnicare and allied on november   the payor mix for the eleven months period would have been as follows medicare  medicaid  private payors including managed care payors  and uk nhs and other governmental payors 
the company believes that a substantial portion of its revenues derived from private payors was subject to case management and managed care and that this relationship will continue in the future 
the company maintains a diversified offering of home services and products in an attempt to mitigate the impact of potential reimbursement reductions for any individual product or service 
due to changing interpretation of regulations and statutes by federal and state regulatory bodies  the specialty pharmacy industry has been subject to pressure related to its marketing of diabetic supplies to physicians and other referral sources 
in addition  hcfa implemented new procedures regarding the dispensing of diabetic supplies to patients as of october  these and other regulatory changes may have a negative impact on revenues and selling  general and administrative expenses of the company s diabetic supplies businesses in the future which contributed approximately of revenue for the year ended september   although the ultimate impact cannot be determined at this time 
the company s gross margins will be influenced by the revenue mix of its product lines and by changes in reimbursement rates 
the company historically has recognized higher gross margins from its specialized mail order and medical supplies pharmacy and respiratory therapy operations than from its nursing and infusion therapy operations 
on a pro forma basis  assuming the company owned of omnicare and allied on november   the gross profit margin for the eleven month period would have been versus the actual for the same period 
subsequent acquisitions  when completed  will continue to impact the relative mix of revenues and overall gross margin 
the company amortizes goodwill over a period of years 
the company has selected the forty year amortization convention based on the likely period of time over which related economic benefits will be realized 
the company believes its estimated goodwill life is reasonable given  among other factors  the continuing movement of patient care to non institutional settings  expanding demand due to demographic trends  the emphasis of the company on establishing coverage in each of its local and regional markets and the consistent practice of other home health care companies 
at each balance sheet date  management assesses whether there has been a permanent impairment in the value of goodwill and the amount of any impairment by comparing anticipated undiscounted future cash flows from operating activities with the carrying value of goodwill 
the factors considered by management in estimating future cash flows include current operating results  trends and prospects of acquired businesses  as well as the effect of demand  competition  market and other economic factors 
results of operations year ended september  vs 
eleven months ended september  revenues 
total revenues increased by  or to  for the year ended september  from  for the eleven months ended september  with  accounting for the one additional months revenue in fiscal the remaining increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of eleven months of results for the year ended september  versus three months in the comparable prior period for allied  in patient services and omnicare  in respiratory  medical equipment and supplies sales as well as an increase in respiratory  medical equipment and supplies sales due primarily to an increase in the number of patients serviced in the company s specialty mail order pharmacy and medical supplies operations 
these increases were partly offset by a decrease in patient services revenue attributable to the sale of radamerica and the tni sale  decreases in respiratory  medical equipment and supplies sales due to exiting certain product lines of dermaquest beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as well as a reduction in revenue due to the balanced budget act  and lower infusion services revenue  due to a decline in number of patients serviced 
pursuant to the passage of the balanced budget act  a reduction in medicare reimbursement of diabetic testing strips and a reduction in medicare reimbursement of respiratory drugs became effective january  these reductions reduced revenue  increased cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues and decreased gross profit for respiratory  medical equipment and supplies sales effective with the reimbursement reduction as discussed herein 
in addition  pursuant to the social security act s authority to hcfa to alter certain reimbursement rates that are not inherently reasonable  medicare is proposing further reductions in medicare reimbursement rates becoming effective as follows i january  up to an additional reduction for diabetic testing strips depending on the state  ii january  a reduction for diabetic lancets  iii january  an additional reduction for diabetic lancets  iv january  an additional reduction for diabetic lancets  and v january  a reduction for albuterol a respiratory drug 
these reductions are expected to increase cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues  decrease gross profit and decrease operating income for respiratory  medical equipment and supplies sales effective with the reimbursement reduction 
the amount of the impact will be dependent upon product mix  the amount of product cost concessions that the company is able to obtain from its suppliers and the number of patients serviced whose primary insurance coverage is medicare 
cost of revenues

there can be no assurance that any such additional debt or equity will be available to the company  or if available  will be on terms acceptable to the company 
in addition  covenants contained in the credit facility restrict the company from entering into transactions not in the ordinary course of business  including making acquisitions and issuing capital stock  without consent 
accounts receivable 
the company maintains a cash management program that focuses on the reimbursement function  as growth in accounts receivable has been the main operating use of cash historically 
at september  and   and   respectively  of the company s total assets consisted of accounts receivable substantially from third party payors 
such payors generally required substantial documentation in order to process claims 
the collection time for accounts receivable is typically the longest for services that relate to new patients or additional services requiring medical review for existing patients 
accounts receivable decreased by  from september  to september  primarily due to the tni sale 
during fiscal and the eleven month period ended september   the company experienced a significant increase in accounts receivable at its dermaquest operation whose main product lines include wound care and orthotic products 
medicare  to whom substantially all dermaquest claims are initially submitted for payment  has subjected these claims to an extensive review process and  in many cases  has required dermaquest to pursue payment through the fair hearing process of the medicare intermediary 
this has created significant delays in payments  in many cases extending beyond twelve months  leading to the significant buildup in accounts receivable and corresponding negative impact on cash flow 
the company conducted an extensive review of the dermaquest receivables in connection with the decision to discontinue these product lines in the continental us and  as a result  established additional reserves of  based on the potential inability to secure required documentation in a timely manner for reimbursement as a result of no longer being in these business lines 
in establishing the net realizable value of its accounts receivable for dermaquest  the company has relied on its historical and anticipated payment experience 
the company believes that based on current regulations  its billing and related documentation practices  and its extensive review  the dermaquest accounts receivable reflect the net realizable value of these receivables 
management s goal is to maintain accounts receivable levels equal to or less than industry averages  which will tend to mitigate the risk of recurrence of negative cash flows from operations by reducing the required investment in accounts receivable and thereby increasing cash flows from operations 
days sales outstanding dsos is a measure of the average number of days taken by the company to collect its accounts receivable  calculated from the date services are rendered 
for the year ended september   the eleven month period and the year ended october   the company s average dsos were  and  respectively 
as the proportion of third party payors claims related to alternate site health care increases  the company believes that third party payors are likely to increase their review of such claims  the effect of which would be to generally increase dsos

the company has a senior secured revolving credit facility with a group of commercial banks 
subject to certain exceptions  the credit facility prohibits or restricts  among other things  the incurrence of liens  the incurrence of indebtedness  certain fundamental corporate changes  dividends  the making of specified investments and certain transactions with affiliates

year general 
the year computer issue refers to potential conditions in computer programs whereby a two digit field rather than a four digit field is used to define the applicable year 
unless corrected  some computer programs may be unable to appropriately function on january  because these programs will read the in the year as january  if uncorrected  the problem could result in computer system failures or equipment and medical device malfunctions affecting patient diagnosis and treatment thereby disrupting the company s business operations and subjecting the company to potentially significant legal liabilities 
during the early part of  the company formed a task force consisting of members of senior management  in house legal counsel  representatives from each of the company s operating subsidiaries in both the us and the us  and other company personnel 
the task force also consults with the company s insurance carrier and risk management advisors 
the task force developed an action plan to address the potential problems of the year  which considered the following critical phases i the company s state of readiness  ii risks of the company s year issues  iii costs to address year compliance  and iv the company s contingency plans 
company s state of readiness 
the information technology it and it infrastructure portions of the company s year project  address the inventory  assessment  necessary corrective actions  testing and implementation of external vendor products  mission critical third party software and internally developed software 
in that regard  the company believes it has identified in both the us and the us  the various software applications that may be potentially impacted 
the company s assessment of all it related components is currently underway and the company anticipates completing  in most respects  any remediation of external vendor products  mission critical third party software and internally developed software by march  the company also expects that by june   implementation and testing of all remediation will be complete 
with respect to the non it portion of the company s year project  the company has undertaken a program to inventory  assess and correct or replace where necessary impacted mission critical as well as non mission critical vendor and supplier products including but not limited to drugs  medical supplies and specialty mail order pharmaceutical products  medical equipment  telephone systems  postage machines and other related equipment with year risk 
these types of supplies and equipment play a vital role in the day to day operations of the company 
the company is implementing in both the us and the us  a program of contacting vendors and suppliers  analyzing and acting upon information provided to replace or otherwise amend any devices or equipment that pose a year impact 
the company is prioritizing its non it efforts by allocating resources to equipment and medical devices that will have a direct impact on patient safety and health with a goal of minimizing and or eliminating the associated risks 
the company recognizes  to a certain degree  that it is relying upon information that is being provided by equipment and medical device manufacturers regarding the year status of their respective products 
while the company is attempting to evaluate information provided by its present vendors and suppliers  there can be no assurance that in all instances accurate information is being provided 
the company s assessment of potentially non it affected components is currently underway and the company anticipates completing  in most respects  any required corrective actions by march  the company expects that by june   implementation and testing of all remediation will be complete 
lastly  the company relies heavily upon third party payors  including to a large extent governmental payors such as medicare and medicaid in the us and the nhs in the uk for accurate and timely reimbursement of claims  often through the use of electronic data interfaces 
although much has been published publicly stating that the government is working to solve its own year issues in a timely manner  the company has received no assurance that their systems and interfaces will be converted timely 
failure of any of the company s third party payors  especially governmental payors  to solve their year issues could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  cash flows  and results of operations 
risks of the company s year issues 
failure from any of the aforementioned it and or non it equipment and components  including the support from third parties  could have a material adverse impact on the company s operations in both the us and the us resulting in the potential inability to provide health care services to its patients 
this inability could result in the loss of revenue which at the present time is unable to be quantified and give rise to litigation 
failure of the third party payor s systems also could have a material adverse affect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
costs to address year compliance 
as of december  costs incurred for all efforts of the company s year action plan amount to  and have not been material to the company 
these costs have been expensed as incurred and have been funded by operating cash flows 
the remaining cost of the year project is expected to be approximately  and is based upon the best estimates from the company s management and the year task force 
this cost will also be expensed as incurred and be funded by operating cash flows 
these estimates as well as anticipated completion dates were derived by consideration of availability of resources  utilizing assumptions and relying upon third party representations 
however  there can be no guarantees that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could be materially different 
the company s contingency plans 
each operating subsidiary both in the us and the us has been asked to develop a contingency plan to restore the material functions of each of its systems or activities in the case of a year failure 
the respective subsidiaries are in the preliminary stages of defining these plans and will make them more comprehensive  as additional information becomes available through testing and external sources 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete all of the modifications in the required time frame  that unanticipated events will not occur or that the company will be able to identify all year issues before problems arise 
in addition  the company has no assurance that third party payors and vendors will have the ability to identify and solve all or substantially all their year issues 
therefore  there can be no assurance that the year issue will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  cash flows and results of operations
