overview cvt is an early stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the application of molecular cardiology to the discovery  development and commercialization of novel small molecule drugs for the treatment of chronic cardiovascular disease 
since its inception in december  substantially all of the company s resources have been dedicated to research and development 
to date  cvt has not generated any revenue from product sales and does not expect to generate any such revenues for several years 
as of december   the company had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
the company expects its sources of revenue  if any  for the next several years to consist of payments under corporate collaborations and interest income 
the process of developing the company s products will require significant additional research and development  preclinical testing and clinical trials  as well as regulatory approval 
these activities  together with the company s general and administrative expenses  are expected to result in operating losses for the foreseeable future 
the company will not receive product revenue unless it or its collaborators complete clinical trials and successfully commercialize one or more of its products 
cvt is subject to risks common to biopharmaceutical companies  including risks inherent in its research and development efforts and clinical trials  reliance on collaborative partners  enforcement of patent and proprietary rights  the need for future capital  potential competition and uncertainty of regulatory approval 
in order for a product to be commercialized  it will be necessary for cvt and its collaborators to conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate efficacy and safety of the company s product candidates  obtain regulatory clearances and enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  as well as obtain market acceptance 
there can be no assurance that the company will generate revenues or achieve and sustain profitability in the future 
results of operations years ended december  and collaborative research revenues 
the company recognized collaborative research revenues of million for the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december  collaborative research revenue for the year ended december  was earned in connection with the company s collaboration with biogen for the development and commercialization of cvt research and development expenses 
the company s research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the higher expenses in were primarily due to increased activity associated with the development of ranolazine as well as a million milestone payment to syntex payable under the original license agreement for ranolazine and the issuance of shares of the company s common stock to syntex valued at  under an amendment to the license agreement 
these expenses were partially offset by a decrease in the use of outside contract services by the company 
the company expects research and development expenses to increase significantly over the next several years as the company expands research and product development efforts 
in particular  expenses will likely increase due to the clinical trial expenses for ranolazine 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to the amortization of deferred compensation expense  personnel recruiting expenses and new administrative expenses associated with becoming a public company 
the company expects general and administrative expenses to increase in the future due to increases in the company s research and development activities 
interest income expense  net 
interest income expense  net increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in was a result of higher average investment balances resulting from the proceeds of the company s initial public offering completed in november  payments received in connection with the company s collaboration and license agreements with biogen entered into in march and proceeds from the private placement of shares of common stock with biotech target sa  a wholly owned subsidiary of bb biotech ag of switzerland bb biotech  in october in contrast  during the year ended december   the company had lower average investment balances and incurred prepayment penalties associated with a restructuring of the company s debt 
the company expects that net interest income expense  will fluctuate with average investment balances and prevailing interest rates 
the company has not generated taxable income to date 
at december   the net operating losses available to offset future taxable income for federal income tax purposes were approximately million 
because the company has experienced ownership changes  future utilization of the carryforwards may be limited in any one fiscal year pursuant to internal revenue code regulations 
the carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in through if not utilized 
as a result of the annual limitation  a portion of these carryforwards may expire before becoming available to reduce the company s federal income tax liabilities 
years ended december  and collaborative research revenues 
the company recognized collaborative research revenues of  for the year ended december   due to a non refundable  up front fee earned from a license agreement with bayer ag 
research and development expenses 
the company s research and development expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the higher expenses in were largely due to higher development expenditures associated with the cvt hypercholesterolemia program  which was terminated in late and for which minimal costs were incurred in in addition  research and development expenses decreased in as a result of a decrease in research personnel and related expenses resulting from a reduction in headcount in november this was partially offset by a  license fee paid in equity securities to a collaborative partner in march general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   due to decreases in personnel and related expenses 
interest income expense  net 
interest income expense  net decreased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december   as a result of higher loan balances and prepayment penalties associated with a restructuring of the company s debt  partially offset by higher average cash balances 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations since inception primarily through private placements of preferred and common stock  public offerings of common stock  equipment and leasehold improvement financing  other debt financing and payments under corporate collaborations 
in november  the company completed an initial public offering and raised net proceeds of approximately million 
on march   the company entered into two research collaboration and license agreements with biogen that together resulted in cash receipts of million 
in addition  biogen agreed to make significant development milestones and equity investments and provide funding under a general purpose loan facility  all of which are subject to achievement of certain clinical development and commercialization milestones 
biogen will also pay royalties from any future product sales 
on october   the company raised net proceeds of million in a private placement of equity securities with bb biotech 
cash  cash equivalents and short and long term investments at december  totaled million compared to million at december  the increase in was due to the receipt of the upfront payment of million associated with the company s collaborations with biogen and the private placement of equity securities with bb biotech 
the company s funds are currently invested in short and long term  investment grade  interest bearing debt obligations 
in january  the company filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission in connection with a follow on public offering 
the total number of shares sold  including exercise of the underwriters option to purchase additional shares  was  at a price of per share with net proceeds to the company of approximately  net cash used in operations for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash used in operating activities in was primarily the result of deferred revenue of million received in conjunction with the upfront payment under the collaboration with biogen 
from inception  through december   the company had invested approximately million in property and equipment  of which approximately million was financed through equipment and leasehold financings at various times 
the company will require substantial additional funding in order to complete its research and development activities and commercialize any potential products 
the company currently estimates that its existing resources and projected interest income will enable the company to maintain its current and planned operations through the third quarter of however  there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional funding prior to such time 
the company s forecast of the period of time through which its financial resources will be adequate to support its operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors  including those described in risk factors need for additional future capital  uncertainty of additional funding and elsewhere in this report 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including scientific progress in its research and development programs  the size and complexity of such programs  the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  the ability of the company to establish and maintain corporate partnerships  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  the cost of manufacturing preclinical and clinical material and other factors not within the company s control 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing to meet the company s capital requirements will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
insufficient funds may require the company to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of its research or development programs  to lose rights under existing licenses or to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than the company would otherwise choose 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
year some of the company s computer programs may have been written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  those computer programs may have time sensitive software that recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could cause a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in normal business activities 
the company is in the process of completing an assessment to determine if it will have to modify or replace portions of its software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the total cost for the year assessment project and modification or replacement project  if necessary  is estimated not to have a material adverse affect on future financial or operating results of the company 
the projects are estimated to be completed no later than december   which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
the company believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  if necessary  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for the computer systems 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
however  there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties
