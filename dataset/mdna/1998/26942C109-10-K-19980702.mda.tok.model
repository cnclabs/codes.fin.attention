interest rate and market risk the normal course of business activity exposes the company to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is managed within an overall asset liability framework for the company 
the principal objectives of asset liability management are to manage the sensitivity of net interest spreads to potential changes in interest rates and to enhance profitability in ways that promise sufficient reward for recognized and controlled risk 
funding positions are kept within predetermined limits designed to ensure that risk taking is not excessive and that liquidity is properly managed 
the company employs a sensitivity analysis in the form of a net interest income simulation to help characterize the market risk arising from changes in interest rates 
fluctuations in interest rates may result in changes in the fair market value of the company s financial instruments  cash flows and net interest income 
the asset liability management process manages the company s interest rate risk position 
the objective of this process is the optimization of the company s financial position  liquidity and net interest income  while maintaining a relatively neutral interest rate sensitive position 
the company uses a simulation modeling process to measure interest rate risk and evaluate potential strategies 
the company s net interest income simulation includes all financial assets and liabilities 
this simulation measures both the term risk and basis risk in the company s asset liabilities 
the simulation also captures the option characteristics of products  such as caps and floors on floating rate loans  the right to pre pay mortgage loans without penalty and the ability of customers to withdraw deposits on demand 
these options are modeled through the use of primarily historical customer behavior and statistical analysis 
these simulations incorporate assumptions regarding balance sheet growth and mix  pricing  and the repricing and maturity characteristics of the existing and projected balance sheet 
other interest rate related risks such as prepayment  basis and option risk are also considered 
simulation results quantify interest rate risk under various interest rate scenarios 
management then develops and implements appropriate strategies 
the board of directors regularly reviews the overall interest rate risk position and asset liability management strategies 
the company uses four standard scenarios rates unchanged  expected rates  high rates  and low rates in analyzing interest rate sensitivity 
the expected scenario is based on the company s projected future interest rates  while the high and low rate scenarios cover a basis points upward and downward rate movement 
the company closely monitors each scenario to manage interest rate risk 
as of march   the expected rate simulation indicated a decline in annual net interest income of  or 
percent relative to the unchanged rate simulation and a  or 
percent decline in market value 
management estimates the company s annual net interest income would increase approximately  or percent  and decrease approximately  or percent should interest rates instantaneously rise or fall basis points  versus the projection under unchanged rates 
a fair market value analysis of the company s balance sheet calculated under an instantaneous basis point increase in rates over march   estimates a  or 
percent increase in market value 
the company estimates a like decrease in rates would decrease market value  these changes in market value represent less than percent of the total carrying value of total assets at year end 
these simulated computations should not be relied upon as indicative of actual future results 
further  the computations do not contemplate certain actions that management may undertake in response to future changes in interest rates 
looking toward managing interest rate risk in fiscal  the company will continue to face term risk and basis risk and may be confronted with several risk scenarios 
if interest rates rise  net interest income may actually increase  if deposit rates lag increases in market rates 
the company could  however  experience significant pressure on net interest income if there is a substantial increase in deposit rates relative to market rates 
this basis risk potentially could be hedged with interest rate caps  but the company believes they are not cost effective in relation to the cost they would mitigate 
a declining interest rate environment might result in a decrease in loan rates  while deposit rates remain relatively stable 
this rate scenario could also create signficant risk to net interest income 
net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis expressed as a percentage of average total assets is referred to as the net interest margin 
the net interest margin represents the average net effective yield on earning assets 
the net interest margin decreased basis to percent during fiscal from percent during fiscal the average balance sheet on the next page presents the individual components of net interest income and expense  net interest spread and net interest margin 
the decrease in the net interest margin in fiscal was primarily attributable to the increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities while the yield earned on interest earning assets remained percent 
the yield earned on average loans remained consistent at percent for fiscal compared to percent in fiscal this is attributable to the company s ability to originate higher yielding loans for the company s portfolio 
in addition  the yield earned on mortgage backed securities remained consistent at percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal the cost of deposits increased primarily because of the basis point increase in the cost of checking accounts and the basis point increase in money market accounts from percent and percent  respectively  in fiscal to percent and percent  respectively  in fiscal the company also relies on borrowings from the fhlb and other borrowings to fund asset growth and the cost of fhlb advances and other borrowings increased basis points to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal the following table reflects the average balances  the interest income or expense and the average yield and cost of funds of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities during the fiscal years ended march   and average balance sheet year ended march  average yield average yield average yield dollars in thousands balance interest cost balance interest cost balance interest cost assets loans       mortgage backed securities       fhlb stock    taxable investments       tax exempt investment securities       interest earning deposits and federal funds sold    total interest earning assets       non interest earning assets    total assets    liabilities and equity savings       checking      money market     certificates of deposit       total deposits       advances and other borrowings       total interest bearing liabilities       non interest bearing liabilities    stockholders equity    total liabilities and equity    net interest rate spread    taxable equivalent adjustment net interest income  actual    net interest earning assets net interest margin    interest earning assets as a percentage of interest bearing liabilities non accrual loans are included in average balances and income on such loans  if recognized  is recorded on a cash basis

the bank s asset and liability committee alco has primary responsibility for managing the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
the alco is comprised of three directors and three officers of the bank 
the alco meets two times a week to establish interest rates on loans and deposits and review interest rate sensitivity and liquidity positions 
interest rate sensitivity is a measure of exposure to changes in net interest income due to changes in market interest rates 
the excess of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities repricing or maturing in a given period of time is commonly referred to as gap 
a positive gap indicates an excess of interest rate sensitive assets over interest rate sensitive liabilities  a negative gap indicates an excess of interest rate sensitive liabilities over interest rate sensitive assets 
the company s gap position is evaluated continuously and reviewed by the alco in bi weekly meetings 
the company has a positive one year gap of percent as of march  the following table presents the company s interest sensitivity gap between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at march  the gap analysis is prepared using either actual repricing intervals or maturity dates when stated

loan portfolio and concentration since  the company s loan portfolio has grown percent 
loans receivable  net  including loans held for sale  increased  or percent to  at march  compared to  at march  the primary reason is due to the increase in residential first mortgages held for sale 
the community banking group originates primarily non residential real estate mortgages  commercial  consumer and home equity and second mortgage loans in the metro atlanta area 
additionally  ebcg has invested  as of march   in twelve mezzanine financing loans made to affiliated llcs operating exteded stay hotels

this loan category decreased  or percent to  at march  compared to  at march  residential first mortgages are generally believed to be a conservative investment 
the company s high concentration of residential first mortgages tends to reduce its level of delinquencies and problem loans

in accordance with the company s business plan  the volume of construction and acquisition and development lending increased in each of the previous four years 
the company understands the risks inherent in interim construction financing and has designed an efficient organization to properly mitigate those risks through strict underwriting and close monitoring of the process 
the company s underwriting criteria consider  among other things  the equity investment of the borrower  the track record and financial condition of the builder  the demand for the type of house to be constructed including a marketing survey of inventory levels by price range and location  the feasibility of house plans and costs  the growth prospects for the economy and the impact of changes in interest rates 
the company has a multi state construction inspection and appraisal network 
its staff closely monitors construction progress and draws throughout the process

in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of the examination process  periodically review the reserve for loan losses 
such agencies require the bank to recognize additions to the reserve based on judgments with regard to information available to them at the time of the examination 
management is not aware of any loans classified for regulatory purposes as loss  doubtful or substandard that i have not been disclosed and ii either a represent or result from trends or uncertainties  which management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results  liquidity  or capital resources  or b represent material credits in which management is aware of any information which causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrower to comply with the loan repayment terms 
construction and acquisition and development loans comprise the largest component of the company s loan portfolio 
construction loans frequently involve greater risk than residential mortgage loans principally due to i the creditworthiness of construction borrowers in general  ii the potential risks associated with securing permanent financing  and iii general market conditions in the housing industry 
the company s investment in equipment leases involves risk because of i the decline in value of the leased equipment  ii the company s reliance on third party lessors for servicing the leases  and iii the location of lessees outside the company s geographic market 
management believes that the bank s credit review and loan monitoring processes are adequate to evaluate and monitor these risks and that the bank s allowance for possible loan losses is adequate in relation to the composition of its loan portfolio 
although the company s non accrual loans as a percentage of total loans was percent at march   there is a risk that the quality of the company s loan portfolio could decline 
the rapid growth in loans  the concentration of construction loans  and the risk inherent in lease portfolio each present a risk that the quality of the loan portfolio could decline

charge offs related to this decline were primarily related to a single lessor in the amount of  all outstanding obligations of this lessor have been charged off to the reserve and  therefore  no further reserve is required in connection with this relationship 
loan loss reserves totaled  and  respectively  at march  and loan loss reserves to total problem assets increased to percent at march  compared to percent at march  an allocation of the reserve for loan losses has been made according to the respective amounts deemed necessary to provide for the possibility of incurred losses within the various loan categories 
although other relevant factors are considered  the allocation is primarily based on previous charge off experience adjusted for risk characteristic changes among each category 
additional reserve amounts are allocated by evaluating the loss potential of individual loans that management has considered impaired 
the reserve for loan loss allocation is based on subjective judgment and estimates  and therefore is not necessarily indicative of the specific amounts or loan categories in which charge offs may ultimately occur 
management believes that the reserves for losses on loans are adequate based upon management s evaluation of  among other things  estimated value of the underlying collateral  loan concentrations  specific problem loans  and economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to repay and such other factors which  in management s judgment  deserve recognition under existing economic conditions 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowances may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions and composition of the company s loan portfolio
