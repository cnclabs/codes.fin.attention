introduction in the past years  the number of people over the age of began to grow significantly faster than the overall population 
at the same time  advances in medical technology have increased the life expectancies of an increasingly large number of medically complex patients 
this trend  combined with the implementation of healthcare cost containment measures by private insurers and government reimbursement programs  has created a need for a more cost efficient alternate site for the provision of a wide range of medical and rehabilitative services which traditionally have been provided in an acute care hospital 
to address this need  the company began in the late s to develop medical specialty units within its geriatric care facilities 
the company opened its first msu in april in conjunction with healthsouth  and as of december  operated msus totaling  beds 
beginning in  the company began to expand the range of related services it offers to its patients directly in order to serve the full spectrum of patients post acute care needs 
the company is now able to offer directly to its patients  rather than through third party providers  a continuum of care following discharge from an acute care hospital 
ihs post acute services include subacute care  home care  skilled nursing facility care  home respiratory care  home health nursing care  other homecare services and contract rehabilitation  hospice  lithotripsy and diagnostic services 
the company s post acute care network strategy is to provide cost effective continuity of care for its patients in multiple settings  using geriatric care facilities as platforms to provide a wide variety of subacute medical and rehabilitative services more typically delivered in the acute care hospital setting and using home healthcare to provide those medical and rehabilitative services which do not require hour monitoring 
to implement its post acute care network strategy  the company has focused on i developing market concentration for its post acute care services in targeted states due to increasing payor consolidation and the increased preference of payors  physicians and patients for dealing with only one service provider  ii expanding the range of home healthcare and related services it offers to patients directly in order to provide patients with a continuum of care throughout their recovery  to better control costs and to meet the growing desire by payors for one stop shopping  and iii developing subacute care units 
given the increasing importance of managed care in the healthcare marketplace and the continued cost containment pressures from medicare  medicaid and private payors  ihs has been restructuring its operations to enable ihs to focus on obtaining contracts with managed care organizations and to provide capitated services 
ihs strategy is to become a preferred or exclusive provider of post acute care services to managed care organizations and other payors 
the balanced budget act of the bba  enacted in august  makes numerous changes to the medicare and medicaid programs which could significantly affect the delivery of subacute care  skilled nursing facility care and home healthcare 
with respect to medicare  the bba required the establishment of a prospective payment system for skilled nursing facilities  under which such facilities will be paid a federal per diem rate  based on level of medical acuity  for virtually all covered services provided to medicare patients 
the prospective payment system will be phased in over three cost reporting periods  starting with cost report periods beginning on or after july  the bba also instituted consolidated billing for skilled nursing facility services  under which payments for non physician part b services for beneficiaries no longer eligible for part a skilled nursing facility care will be made to the facility  regardless of whether the item or service was furnished by the facility  by others under arrangement or under any other contracting or consulting arrangement  effective for items or services furnished on or after july  the bba also reduced the medicare national payment limits for oxygen and oxygen equipment used in home respiratory therapy by in and from levels in and each subsequent year 
in addition  the bba requires the secretary of the department of health and human services to establish a prospective payment system for home nursing services starting with cost report periods beginning after october  based upon prior legislative proposals  ihs anticipates that the prospective payment system for home nursing will provide for prospectively established per visit payments to be made for all covered services  subject to an annual aggregate per episode unit  with providers having costs below the predetermined rate being able to keep some or all of the difference 
under the bba  home health agencies are also required to submit claims for all services  and all payments will be made to the home health agency regardless of whether the item or service was furnished by the agency or others 
the bba also contains provisions affecting outpatient rehabilitation providers  including a reduction in operating and capital costs in  a fee schedule for therapy services beginning in  and the application of per beneficiary caps beginning in with respect to medicaid  the bba repeals the so called boren amendment  which required state medicaid programs to reimburse nursing facilities for the costs that are incurred by efficiently and economically operated providers in order to meet quality and safety standards 
as a result  states now have considerable flexibility in establishing payment rates 
general basic medical services the company includes in basic medical services revenues all room and board charges for its geriatric care patients other than patients in its msu and alzheimer s programs at its owned and leased geriatric care and assisted living facilities 
the following table sets forth the company s sources of basic medical services revenues by payor type for the periods indicated years ended december  pro forma private pay medicare medicaid total gives effect to acquisitions consummated by ihs in the company classifies revenues from commercial insurers  health maintenance organizations hmos and other charge based sources and from individuals including the co insurance portion of medicare paid by individuals as private pay 
the decrease in the percentage of basic medical services revenues received from private pay sources and medicare from to and the commensurate increase in the percentage received from medicaid was primarily the result of the higher level of medicaid patients in the geriatric care facilities in which the company acquired ownership or leasehold interests 
the company seeks to increase the percentage of basic medical services revenues received from private pay sources and medicare 
changes in the mix of the company s patients among the private pay  medicare and medicaid categories can significantly affect the profitability of the company s operations 
generally  private pay patients constitute the most profitable category of patients and medicaid patients the least profitable 
the occupancy percentages for those beds from which basic medical services revenues are derived are shown in the table below 
the percentages are calculated both on the basis of the weighted average number of beds licensed regardless of whether such beds are actually available for the provision of basic medical services and the weighted average number of beds in service for the period 
in certain facilities the company temporarily operates fewer beds than it is licensed to operate so as to permit routine maintenance and to accommodate patients desiring private rooms 
in addition  the company has removed beds from service for extended periods as certain facilities have undergone construction projects for expansion purposes and to implement its medical specialty units 
all revenues derived from licensed beds located in msus or used in the renaissance program are included in specialty medical services revenues  accordingly  such beds are not considered beds licensed or beds in service for purposes of determining occupancy for those beds from which basic medical services revenues are derived 
years ended december  pro forma beds licensed beds in service gives effect to acquisitions consummated by ihs in specialty medical services specialty medical services revenues include all charges to the company s msu patients for room and board as well as all revenues from providing rehabilitative therapies  pharmaceuticals  medical supplies and durable medical equipment to all its patients

the decrease in the percentage of specialty medical services revenues received from private pay sources from to and the commensurate increase in medicare and medicaid was primarily the result of the higher level of medicare and medicaid patients serviced by the facilities and related services companies acquired during this period  as well as the opening of new  and the expansion of existing  msu programs 
the company s experience has been that medicare patients constitute a higher percentage of an msu program s initial occupancy 
the average occupancy rate of the company s msu beds on a weighted average basis was in the year ended december  as compared with in the year ended december   in the year ended december  and in the year ended december  average occupancy in the alzheimer s programs in the company s owned and leased facilities  which had an average of beds in the years ended december  and  beds in the year ended december  and beds in the year ended december   was   and  respectively

the company sold its pharmacy division in july see acquisition and divestiture history 
the percentage decrease in msu revenue in  and was primarily the result of the acquisition of rehabilitation  home healthcare and similar service companies in connection with the company s vertical integration strategy and the implementation of the company s post acute care network 
msu revenue as a percentage of total revenues and as a percentage of specialty medical revenues is expected to continue to decrease as the company implements its vertical integration strategy and continues to expand its post acute care network through the acquisition of rehabilitation  home healthcare and similar service companies 
while ihs added  msu beds in and msu beds in  it added only an additional beds in and beds in with the implementation of a prospective payment system for skilled nursing facilities under medicare  which will begin for ihs in  ihs intends to continue to provide subacute care services in its skilled nursing facilities  although it does not anticipate continuing to expand significantly its msus to provide such services

both the house and senate balanced budget proposals proposed a reduction in future growth in medicare and medicaid spending from a year to approximately a year 
while medicare and medicaid reform had been discussed prior to the fourth quarter  the company came to believe that a future reduction in the growth of medicare and medicaid spending was virtually a certainty 
such reforms include  in the near term  a continued freeze in the medicare routine costs limit rcl  followed by reduced increases in later years  more stringent documentation requirements for medicare rcl exception requests  reductions in the growth in medicaid reimbursement in most states  as well as salary equivalency in rehabilitative services  and  in the longer term years  a switch to a prospective payment system for home care and nursing homes  and repeal of the boren amendment  which requires that states pay hospitals reasonable and adequate rates 
the company estimated the effect of the aforementioned reforms on each nursing and subacute facility  as well as on its rehabilitative services  respiratory therapy  home care  mobile diagnostic and pharmacy divisions by reducing or in some cases increasing the future revenues and expense growth rates for the impact of each of the aforementioned factors 
accordingly  these events and circumstances triggered the early adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
in the fourth quarter of in accordance with sfas no 
 the company estimated the future cash flows expected to result from those assets to be held and used 
in estimating the future cash flows for determining whether an asset is impaired  and if expected future cash flows used in measuring assets are impaired  the company grouped its assets at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows independent of other groups of assets 
these levels were each of the individual nursing subacute facilities  and each of the home health  rehabilitative therapy  respiratory therapy  pharmacy and mobile diagnostics divisions 
the results of comparing future undiscounted cash flows to historical carrying value were that some individual nursing facilities and one assisted living facility were identified for an impairment charge 
none of the remaining facilities or business units were eligible since only those facilities or business units where the carrying value exceeded the undiscounted cash flows are considered impaired 
prior to adoption of sfas  the company evaluated impairment on the entity level 
such an evaluation yielded no impairment as of september  after determining the facilities identified for an impairment charge the company determined the estimated fair value of such facilities 
also  the company obtained valuation estimates prepared by independent appraisers or had received offers from potential buyers on six of the facilities eligible for impairment  comprising of the total charge 
such valuation estimates were obtained to corroborate the company s estimate of value 
the excess carrying value of goodwill  buildings and improvements  leasehold improvements and equipment above the fair value was million of which million represented goodwill and million represented property and equipment and is included in the statement of operations for as loss on impairment of long lived assets

during the fourth quarter of  the company terminated a year contract entered into in january to manage long term care and psychiatric facilities in california owned by crestwood hospital 
the terms of the contract required the payment of a management fee to ihs and a preferred return to the crestwood owners 
ihs terminated the management contract with crestwood hospital due primarily to changes in california medicaid rates which no longer provided sufficient cash flow at the facilities to support both ihs management fee and the preferred return to the owners 
as a result  the company incurred a loss of million 
such loss consists of the write off of million of management fees  million of loans made to crestwood hospital and the owners of crestwood  as well as the interest thereon  and million of contract acquisition costs 
during the third quarter of  the company merged with integracare  inc in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests 
in connection with this transaction  the company incurred merger costs of million for accounting  legal and other costs 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of ihs changed its accounting estimate regarding the future benefit of deferred pre opening costs 
this change was made in recognition of the change in the estimated future benefit of such costs resulting from the effect of the aforementioned medicare and medicaid reforms 
as a result  the company wrote off million of deferred pre opening costs

the success of the company s msu strategy will depend in part on its ability to obtain reimbursement for those costs which exceed the medicare established reimbursement limits by obtaining waivers of these cost limitations 
the company has submitted waiver requests for cost reports  covering all cost report periods through december  to date  final action has been taken by the health care financing administration hfca on all waiver requests 
the company s final rates as approved by hcfa represent approximately of the requested rates as submitted in the waiver requests 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to recover its excess costs under any waiver requests which may be submitted in the future 
the company s failure to recover substantially all these excess costs would adversely affect its results of operations and could adversely affect its msu strategy
