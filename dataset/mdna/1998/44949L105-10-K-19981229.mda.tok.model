the funding of these future transactions  if any  may require the company to obtain additional sources of financing 
page of impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the company s operations for the last three years has been minimal due to the fact that it is able to adjust its bids to reflect any inflationary increases in cost 
year conversion the year issue is the result of many existing computer programs written to handle two digits  rather than four  to define the applicable year 
accordingly  date sensitive software or hardware may not be able to distinguish between the year and year  and programs that perform arithmetic operations  comparisons or sorting of date fields may begin yielding incorrect results 
this could potentially cause a system failure or miscalculations that could disrupt operations  including  among other things  an inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in normal business activities 
these year issues affect virtually all companies and organizations 
the company has developed plans to address the potential risks it faces as a result of year issues 
these risks include  among other things  the possible failure or malfunction of the company s internal information systems  possible problems with the products and services the company has provided its customers  and possible problems arising from the failure of the company s supplier systems 
the company has developed a plan to address its year issues by initially identifying and assessing year compliance for all of its applications and information technology equipment including all mainframe  network and desktop software and hardware  custom and packaged applications  and it embedded systems  as well as its non information technology embedded systems  including non it equipment and machinery such as security  fire prevention and climate control systems into the categories of business critical  important  and non important systems 
business critical systems are those whose year compliance is necessary to ensure the proper functioning of the business 
these systems have the highest priority in being tested and upgraded  where applicable 
it is expected that all business critical systems will be year compliant by june important systems will also be tested and upgraded with the expectation that  where necessary  they will be year compliant by no later than september  certain other systems classified as not important  since they do not use the date function  will also be tested and upgraded where it is of benefit to the company  but with the lowest priority of the company s three systems classifications 
the company s remediation plan for its year issue is an ongoing process  and the estimated completion dates above are subject to change 
overall  at this time the company believes that its systems will be year compliant in a timely manner for several reasons 
the main or central operating system used by the company is already compliant with the exception of one sub system 
to the extent that current systems that will not be replaced have been determined to be non compliant  the company is working with the suppliers of such systems to obtain upgrades and or enhancements to ensure year compliance 
also  comprehensive testing of nearly all critical systems was performed in november   at the shut down alabama facility in a simulated year environment 
only minor issues were found from the testing which have since been corrected and retested successfully 
page of at this stage in the process  the company has not identified any significant risks 
however  the company believes that the area of the greatest potential risk relates to significant suppliers failing to remediate their year issues in a timely manner 
the company is conducting formal communications with its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which it may be affected by those parties plans to remediate their own year issues in a timely manner 
if a number of significant suppliers are not year compliant  this could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flow 
at this point  the company has not been advised by any significant supplier that it is not year compliant 
the company will develop contingency plans and expects to have them completed during to mitigate the effects of the company s or significant suppliers potential failure to remediate the year issue in a timely manner  the company will take appropriate actions 
such actions may include having arrangements for alternate suppliers  using manual intervention to ensure the continuation of operations where necessary and scheduling activity in december that would normally occur at the beginning of january if it becomes necessary for the company to take these corrective actions  it is uncertain  until the contingency plans are finalized  whether this would result in significant delays in business operations or have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flow 
based upon the company s current estimates  incremental out of pocket costs of its year program are expected not to be material 
costs incurred in fiscal have been minimal and expensed as incurred 
additional costs are expected to be incurred in fiscal and will be associated primarily with the remediation of existing computer software and hardware 
such costs are estimated to be approximately  such costs do not include internal management time  which the company does not separately track  nor the deferral of other projects  the effects of which are not expected to be material to the company s results of operations or financial condition
