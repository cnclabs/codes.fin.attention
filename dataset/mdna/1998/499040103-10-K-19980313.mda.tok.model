a look ahead as we look ahead  we expect another strong year in advertising revenue on a pro forma basis will likely increase in the mid single digits and newspaper profits will continue to grow  most notably in detroit  where all the momentum is positive

impact of year the year issue results from computer programs using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
company computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure  disruption of operations  and or a temporary inability to conduct normal business activities 
based on a recent assessment  the company currently believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems 
if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed in a timely way  the year issue could have a material impact on operations 
in addition  formal communications with all significant suppliers and customers have been initiated to determine the extent to which related interfaces with company systems are vulnerable if these third parties fail to remediate their own year issues 
there can be no assurance that these third party systems will be converted on a timely basis and that they will not adversely affect the company s systems 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to complete and test year modifications and expects to substantially complete this process no later than mid the total estimated cost of this project is in a range of million to million  funded through operating cash flows 
approximately of the total will relate to purchased hardware and software  which will be capitalized 
the remainder will be expensed as incurred 
through  related costs incurred were not material 
in certain cases  an expedited system replacement schedule will also bring enhanced functionality and should serve to reduce future capital requirements
