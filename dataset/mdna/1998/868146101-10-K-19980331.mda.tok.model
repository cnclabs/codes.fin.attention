item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company conducts business through its two primary operating subsidiaries  superior and enterprise 
superior is a leading healthcare consulting firm that provides a wide range of information technology consulting and strategic and operations management consulting services to a broad cross section of healthcare industry participants and healthcare information system vendors 
enterprise assists clients in various industries in developing  designing  implementing and maintaining groupware and intranet and web based information systems and solutions  as well as enterprise messaging and custom applications and legacy systems integration 
the company derives substantially all of its revenues from fees for professional services  the substantial majority of which are billed at contracted hourly rates 
the company establishes standard billing guidelines based on the type and level of service offered 
actual billing rates are established on a project by project basis and may vary from the standard guidelines 
billings are typically made on a bi weekly basis to monitor client satisfaction and manage outstanding accounts receivable balances 
revenue on time and materials contracts is recognized as the services are provided 
a percentage of the company s projects are billed on a fixed fee basis 
the company recognizes revenue on fixed fee projects using the percentage of completion basis 
as of december   the company has increased the number and size of projects billed on a fixed fee basis 
increased use of fixed fee contracts subjects the company to increased risks  including cost overruns 
as of december   the company has been awarded three significant contracts to provide healthcare it outsourcing services 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve profit margins on outsourcing contracts which are consistent with its historical levels of profitability 
the company s historical revenue growth is attributable to various factors  including an increase in the number of projects for existing and new clients  and expanded geographic presence 
in addition  the company seeks to increase revenues by expanding its range of specialty services 
the company manages its client development efforts through several strategic services groups  each having specific geographic responsibility and focus 
the company s most significant expense is cost of services  which consists primarily of consultant salaries and benefits 
in recent years  consultant compensation expense has grown faster than consultant billing rates  resulting in an increase in the company s cost of services as a percentage of revenues 
the company has sought to address this issue by adding an additional variable portion of compensation payable upon the achievement of measurable performance goals 
the company s cost of services as a percentage of revenues is also impacted by its consultant utilization 
the company manages utilization by monitoring project requirements and timetables 
the number of consultants assigned to a project will vary according to the size  complexity  duration and demands of the project 
project terminations  completions and scheduling delays may result in periods when consultants are not fully utilized 
an unanticipated termination of a significant project could cause the company to experience lower consultant utilization  resulting in a higher than expected number of unassigned consultants 
in addition  the establishment of new practice areas and the hiring of consultants in peak hiring periods have resulted in periods of lower consultant utilization and resulting downward pressure on margins until project volume increases in these new areas 
in the future  the establishment of new practice areas  as well as further geographic expansion  could from time to time adversely affect utilization 
variations in consultant utilization would result in quarterly variability of the company s cost of services as a percentage of revenues 
the company s consultants are generally employed on a full time basis  and therefore the company will  in the short run  incur substantially all of its employee related costs even during periods of low utilization 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs of recruiting  continuing education  marketing  facilities  equipment depreciation  and administration  including compensation and benefits 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues continues to decrease as the company leverages its infrastructure expense across its growing revenue base 
historically  executive compensation expense consisted of salaries  formula bonuses and discretionary bonuses paid to the majority stockholder and two other key executives 
the company s historical levels of executive compensation were related primarily to the company s status as a subchapter s corporation and period to period increases in executive compensation expense were related primarily to the company s period to period earnings growth 
the company entered into agreements with these individuals effective upon the closing of the ipo through december   which provide maximum annual compensation in an aggregate amount of  for these three key executives  comprised of base salary  and bonus amounts to be awarded based on the attainment of certain financial performance criteria 
the foregoing compensation arrangements for these three officers did not apply to amounts paid on or prior to the closing of the company s ipo 
the pro forma statement of operations data reflects an adjustment for executive officer compensation for the year ended december  to eliminate the amount by which key executive compensation paid in such period was in excess of the estimated compensation that would have been paid under the executive compensation agreements adopted in october  as if such agreements were in place throughout such period 
the estimated amount payable under the executive compensation agreements was calculated by assuming the payment to the executive officers of their base salaries plus of their potential bonus for the applicable period 
from january  to october  superior was treated as a subchapter s corporation for federal income tax purposes under subchapter s of the internal revenue code and for certain state income tax purposes 
as a result  substantially all of the income of superior during this period was taxed directly to its stockholders rather than superior 
in addition  prior to january   enterprise was taxed as a subchapter s corporation and thereafter as a subchapter c corporation 
following the closing of the ipo  the company  superior and enterprise were subject to corporate federal income taxation on a consolidated basis as subchapter c corporations 
the company completed business combinations with comsul  ltd 
and chi systems  inc in july and august  respectively 
these acquisitions were accounted for using the pooling of interest method and the financial information of the company in this report has been restated to reflect this results of these combinations 
many of the company s engagements involve projects which are critical to the operations of its clients business and which provide benefits that may be difficult to quantify 
the company is currently engaged in assisting clients in auditing year compliance and taking steps to render information systems year compliant 
the year problem is the result of prior computer programs being written using two digits  rather than four digits  to define the applicable year 
any of the client s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in major system failure or miscalculations 
additionally  the company has assisted and continues to assist its clients in selecting and implementing software applications for the clients use in their business 
while the company is not aware of any existing or potential claims  the occurrence of year related systems failures in the information systems of clients of the company could involve the company in disputes and negatively impact client relationships  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations  whether or not the company bears any responsibility  legal or otherwise  for the occurrence of those problems 
the pro forma statement of operations data reflects an adjustment to federal income taxes for the year ended december   assuming superior had been operating as a c corporation during such period  and reflects an effective tax rate of  after giving effect to the executive officer compensation expense adjustments 
in connection with the termination of superior s s corporation status  in the fourth quarter of the company recorded deferred income taxes of approximately  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this income tax expense was in addition to income tax expense otherwise incurred in such quarter and was incurred upon termination of the company s s corporation status

revenues and operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to several factors  such as the number and significance of client engagements commenced and completed during a quarter  delays incurred in connection with a project  consultant hiring  and utilization 
the timing of revenues varies from quarter to quarter because the company s sales cycle can be relatively long and may depend on factors such as the size and scope of assignments  the general ability of clients to terminate engagements without penalty  and general economic conditions 
in addition  the timing of the establishment of new practice areas  geographic expansion and the hiring of key individuals can also have an effect on consultant utilization 
seasonal factors such as vacation days  total business days in a quarter or the business practices of clients  such as deferred commitments on new projects until after the end of the calendar or the client s fiscal year  can cause the company to experience lower consultant utilization 
because a significant percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  a variation in the number or size of client assignments or the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
in addition  the company s annual employees meeting  which is scheduled for may  can result in lower consultant utilization in the quarter in which the meeting occurs
