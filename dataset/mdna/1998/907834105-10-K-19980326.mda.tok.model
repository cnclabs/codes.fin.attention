gas volumes from the south texas plains canada business unit were up mmcfd primarily due to the drilling program in southern texas 
the east texas business unit s volumes increased by mmcfd primarily due to the acquisition and development of properties acquired from castle energy 
the west texas business unit s gas volumes improved mmcfd due to continued success with its horizontal drilling program 
in addition  the gulf onshore offshore business unit gas volumes rose mmcfd primarily due to its drilling program in the southern louisiana area 
the austin chalk business unit s gas volumes increased mmcfd due to its success in the deep giddings field 
these improvements were partially offset by a mmcfd reduction in rockies business unit s gas volumes caused by production declines 
crude oil volumes increased by mbbld primarily due to drilling successes in the masters creek field in louisiana 
natural gas liquids volumes rose mbbld with most of the improvement attributable to the east texas business unit 
production costs increased million to million for  primarily due to a million increase in lease operating expenses 
such increase reflects the impact of higher volumes  as well as increased costs for workovers  maintenance and salt water disposal  primarily in the austin chalk business unit 
total production expenses per mcfe increased to in from in exploration expenses were up million to million compared to reflecting the company s expanded exploration programs 
surrendered lease costs were higher by million as a result of more leasing activity in the east texas and the austin chalk business units 
delay rentals rose million  primarily in austin chalk and the gulf onshore offshore business units 
in addition  geological and geophysical costs were higher by million  primarily in the gulf onshore offshore business unit  while dry hole costs were up by million  primarily in the east texas and gulf onshore offshore business units 
producing property depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased million due to higher production volumes 
this increased expense  was partially offset by a lower unit of production rate 
there were write downs of assets of million in the south texas plains canada business unit relating to moca dome in and million in the rockies and gulf onshore offshore business units in gathering  processing and marketing operations years ended december  millions of dollars operating revenues gas purchases operating margin other oil and gas revenues operating expenses operating costs depreciation  depletion and amortization total operating expenses operating income margins for the gpm operations declined million to million in plant margins were down million resulting from lower sales prices million  higher gas purchase costs and lower gas plant fees despite a improvement in volumes million 
pipeline margins declined million from reflecting lower throughput at ferguson burleson and wahsatch pipelines 
this lower throughput was partially offset by higher volumes provided by the acquisition of highlands 
marketing margins declined by million as a result of higher crude oil purchase costs and reduced margins for natural gas and natural gas liquids 
such higher costs and reduced margins were partially offset by additional margins on volumes from the acquisition of highlands 
other oil and gas revenues in primarily reflect a million gain on the sale of the company s investment in the frontier pipeline 
years ended december  average price realizations plants natural gas per mcf natural gas liquids per bbl average per mcfe sales volumes plants natural gas mmcfd natural gas liquids mbbld total mmcfed plant gas volumes increased by mmcfd over the volumes in  due to the highlands acquisition mmcfd and the masters creek plant start up 
these volume increases were partially offset by lower inlet volumes at the brookeland plant mmcfd 
plant natural gas liquids volumes increased by mbbld primarily due to the highlands acquisition mbbld and the masters creek start up 
gpm operating costs increased by million to million for higher costs relating to the assets acquired from highlands  plant start ups and the addition of support staff  more than offset the absence of the million asset impairment adjustment for the wahsatch pipeline

summary of segment financial data years ended december  millions of dollars segment operating income producing properties gathering  processing and marketing minerals corporate general and administrative total operating income producing property operations years ended december millions of dollars operating revenues  other oil and gas revenues total operating revenues   operating expenses production exploration depreciation  depletion and amortization total operating expenses operating income total operating revenues for producing property operations increased by million to  million in production volume increases of mmcfed added million in revenues while higher prices of per mcfe added million in revenues 
other oil and gas revenues declined by million in reflecting the absence of the columbia settlement million  lower preferential volumes distributed to an investor in a section limited partnership million and lower net gains on property sales 
such decline was partially offset by the reduction of reserves for the columbia settlement in and the absence of a hedging loss in of million 
years ended december  without with hedging hedging average price realizations producing properties natural gas per mcf natural gas liquids per bbl crude oil per bbl average per mcfe years ended december production volumes producing properties natural gas mmcfd natural gas liquids mbbld crude oil mbbld total mmcfed   natural gas volumes increased by mmcfd to mmcfd with increases from development drilling programs in the austin chalk mmcfd and west texas mmcfd business units and a lower distribution of preferential volumes related to the section limited partnership mmcfd 
offsetting these increases were declines in gulf onshore offshore business unit mmcfd resulting largely from the depletion of several offshore wells  and declines in the rockies business unit mmcfd resulting from production problems 
natural gas liquids volumes from producing properties increased by mbbld to mbbld primarily due to ethane recovery in the rockies and south texas plains canada business units and additional lease gas being processed in the austin chalk business unit by the expanded brookeland plant 
crude oil volumes were mbbld lower at mbbld as a result of production declines in south texas plains canada and rockies business units and the sale of certain non core properties  partially offset by property acquisitions and drilling in the austin chalk business unit 
production expenses increased by million to million  largely attributable to higher production taxes and higher lease operating costs 
the increase in production taxes of million reflects increased producing property revenues  the absence of a favorable wyoming production tax settlement million and an unfavorable ad valorem tax adjustment million 
lease operating costs were higher by million primarily in the austin chalk  east texas and west texas business units as a result of increased production volumes and greater workover costs 
production overhead was higher by million in production expenses on a per mcfe basis of were per mcfe higher than  principally reflecting the increase in production taxes 
exploration expenses increased by million primarily due to higher dry hole and surrendered lease provisions 
the dry hole provision was up million due to an increase in exploratory drilling in southern louisiana  offshore  and north and south dakota 
the surrendered lease costs provision was million higher in than surrendered lease costs in reflecting a write down of north and south dakota leasehold million as well as increases in austin chalk and gulf onshore offshore business units leasing activity 
exploration overhead was million higher in than exploration overhead in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased by million to million in as a result of asset impairment adjustments related to certain properties in the rockies and gulf onshore offshore business units million  several offshore property write downs million  higher producing property volumes million  and an unfavorable unit of production rate million 
on a per mcfe basis  depreciation  depletion and amortization  excluding write downs  increased per mcfe to per mcfe in gathering  processing and marketing operations years ended december  millions of dollars operating revenues gas purchases operating margin other oil and gas revenues operating expenses operating costs depreciation  depletion and amortization total operating expenses operating income gathering  processing and marketing margins increased by million to million in increased plant volumes of mmcfed added million in plant revenues while higher prices of per mcfe added million in plant revenues 
pipeline revenue increases of million in were primarily attributable to increased throughput and higher prices at the ferguson burleson pipeline in the austin chalk area and the ozona pipeline in western texas 
revenues from the wahsatch pipeline in the rockies area were down due to lower throughput and tariff rates 
gas purchase costs were higher by million as a result of increased throughput and higher prices paid by the ozona  peachridge and ferguson burleson pipelines and certain plants in the austin chalk area 
marketing margins increased by million in primarily as a result of improved natural gas and natural gas liquids margins  additional marketed volumes and increased natural gas storage activity 
years ended december  average price realizations plants natural gas per mcf natural gas liquids per bbl average per mcfe sales volumes plants natural gas mmcfd natural gas liquids mbbld total mmcfed natural gas liquids volumes increased by mbbld to mbbld primarily due to the expansion of the ozona  brookeland and echo springs plants  greater retention percentages at the brookeland plant reflecting third parties elections to reject liquids  as well as ethane recovery in other rockies area plants 
volume decreases occurred with a contract revision at gulf plains plant  leaner gas streams and lower inlets at certain plants in the austin chalk area and the disposition of certain plants in western texas and the rockies 
natural gas volumes were up mmcfd to mmcfd resulting from the brookeland plant expansion and increased throughput at gulf plains plant 
gathering  processing and marketing expenses increased by million in due to an asset impairment adjustment related to the wahsatch pipeline million and higher marketing expenses million associated with system development  legal and other operating costs 
gpm depreciation  depletion and amortization costs increased million in  primarily due to a higher asset base of plants and pipelines 
minerals operations years ended december  millions of dollars operating revenues operating expenses depreciation  depletion and amortization operating income minerals operating income increased by million to million in  as a result of million in higher soda ash joint venture income  an increase in ballast income  higher coal royalty income associated with more tons mined on the company s leases and decreased operating expenses

the company expects to increase its oil and gas volumes in while growing its reserves 
sales volume growth is anticipated primarily in the gulf onshore offshore  south texas plains canada and austin chalk business units 
the company expects to remain one of the most active drillers in the united states in based on the number of active drilling rigs  and will continue to search for properties and reserves which will supplement its drill site inventory 
in addition  volumes in the gpm business unit are anticipated to increase as a result of the company s acquisition of highlands and recent expansions of patrick draw and masters creek plants 
prices for oil  gas and natural gas liquids for are expected to be lower than the average for the previous years 
increased production from opec countries  including sales by iraq  along with the decline in several asian countries economies has altered the balance between supply and demand for oil  sending recent oil prices lower than in previous years 
the recent mild weather in the united states resulting from the el nino effect has also resulted in a downward trend in gas prices 
the company expects to experience price fluctuations and manages some price risk with hedging activities 
lower prices could materially affect expected future net income  cash flows and capital spending

the company does not expect to be able to replace the operating income it currently receives under the contract with incremental coal sales after the year capital spending increased by million to  million in  compared to million for the company s ability to maintain and improve its operating income and cash flow is dependent upon continued capital spending  among other things 
the following table summarizes capital expenditures for and years ended december  millions of dollars producing properties production exploration property acquisitions total producing properties  gathering  processing and marketing minerals and other total capital expenditures  producing property capital spending was up by million in as a result of higher lease acquisition costs of million  primarily in the austin chalk and east texas business units and increased exploratory and development drilling million 
drilling accounted for million of capital expenditures in  with million in the austin chalk business unit 
property acquisitions totaling million were completed in compared to million in the company expanded its gpm operations and increased its capital spending by million in the increase in gpm capital spending was related to the completion of the masters creek plant in louisiana  expansion of the east texas plant and the acquisition of highlands

item a 
risk management the company has established policies and procedures for managing risk within its organization 
these policies and procedures incorporate internal controls and are governed by a risk management committee 
the level of risk assumed by the company is based on its objectives and earnings  and its capacity to manage risk 
limits are established for each major category of risk  with exposures monitored and managed by company management and reviewed by the risk management committee 
commodity price risk non trading activities the company uses derivative financial instruments for non trading purposes in the normal course of business to manage and reduce risks associated with contractual commitments  price volatility  and other market variables 
these instruments are generally put in place to limit risk of adverse price movements  however  these instruments usually limit future gains from favorable price movements 
such risk management activities are generally accomplished pursuant to exchange traded contracts or over the counter options 
recognition of realized gains losses in the consolidated statement of income and option premium payments receipts are deferred until the underlying physical product is purchased or sold 
unrealized gains losses on derivative financial instruments are not recorded 
margin deposits  deferred gains losses on derivative financial instruments and net premiums are included in other current assets or liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position 
the cash flow impact of derivative and other financial instruments is reflected as cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
as a result of the various hedging transactions for natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil  the company realized million and million of pre tax losses in and  respectively 
since these transactions were hedges on production  these losses were included in sales and other operating revenues and were reflected in the average sales price of the associated products 
the following table summarizes the company s open positions as of december weighted fair unrecognized contract contract avg 
prices value gain loss product type time period volume per mcf millions of dollars millions of dollars gas future swaps feb mar mmcfd gas future swaps apr oct mmcfd gas future swaps nov dec mmcfd gas calls sold feb mar mmcfd gas net calls sold apr oct mmcfd gas puts purchased feb mar mmcfd gas puts purchased apr oct mmcfd gas fixed price feb jun bcf additionally  the company had previously sold near term futures contacts and swaps for february through december with respect to notional natural gas volumes of mmcfd  then subsequently offset these positions by purchasing corresponding volumes through futures contracts and swaps for the same delivery periods 
the unrealized gain at december  relating to these transactions was million 
up fuels periodically enters into financial contracts in conjunction with transportation  storage  and customer service programs 
the unrecognized mark to market loss associated with such contracts as of december  is million 
the company had a total unrecognized mark to market present value gain of million related to the financial and fixed price sales contracts described above 
this gain consists of million net gain on long term fixed price sales contracts and million net gain on financial derivative instruments 
unrecognized mark to market gains and losses were determined based on current market prices  as quoted by recognized dealers  assuming round lot transactions and using a mid market convention without regard to market liquidity 
the actual gains or losses ultimately realized by the company from such hedges may vary significantly from the foregoing amounts due to the volatility of the commodity markets 
commodity price risk trading activities periodically  the company may enter into transactions involving a wide range of energy related derivative financial transactions that are not the result of hedging activities 
these instruments are generally put into place based on the company s analysis and expectations with respect to price movement or changes in other market variables 
as of december  and  there were no commodity price risk trading activity contracts outstanding 
interest rate swaps the company periodically enters into rate swaps and contracts to hedge certain interest rate transactions 
as of december  and  there were no interest rate contracts outstanding which materially affect the results of operations or financial condition of the company 
foreign currency contracts the company periodically enters into foreign currency contracts to hedge specific currency exposures from commercial transactions 
as of december  and  there were no foreign currency contracts outstanding 
credit risk credit risk is the risk of loss as a result of nonperformance by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations 
because the loss can occur at some point in the future  a potential exposure is added to the current replacement value  to arrive at a total expected credit exposure 
the company has established methodologies to establish limits  monitor and report creditworthiness and concentrations of credit to reduce such credit risk 
at december   the company s largest credit risk associated with any single counterparty  represented by the net fair value of open contracts with such counterparty was less than million 
performance risk performance risk results when a counterparty fails to fulfill its contractual obligations such as commodity pricing or volume commitments 
typically  such risk obligations are defined within the trading agreements 
the company utilizes its credit risk methodology to manage performance risk 
other matters environmental costs the company generates and disposes of hazardous and nonhazardous waste in its current and former operations  and is subject to increasingly stringent federal  state and local environmental regulations 
the company has identified seven sites currently subject to environmental response actions or on the superfund national priorities list or state superfund lists  at which it is or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements 
certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of various sites  consequently  the company s ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to other parties in addition to costs relating to its own activities at each site 
in addition  the company is or may be liable for certain environmental remediation matters involving existing or former facilities 
as of december   long and short term liabilities totaling million had been accrued for future costs of all sites where the company s obligation is probable and where such costs reasonably can be estimated  however  the ultimate cost could be lower or as much as higher 
this accrual includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites  as well as for ongoing monitoring costs  but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties 
the accrual also includes million for the obligation to participate in the remediation of the wilmington  california field properties 
cost estimates were based on information available for each site  financial viability of other potentially responsible parties prps and existing technology  laws and regulations 
the company believes that it has accrued adequately for its share of costs at sites subject to joint and several liability 
the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine with certainty because of the number of prps involved  site specific cost sharing arrangements with other prps  the degree of contamination by various wastes  the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites and the speculative nature of remediation costs 
the company also is involved in reducing emissions  spills and migration of hazardous materials 
remediation of identified sites and control and prevention of environmental exposures required spending of million in and million in in  the company anticipates spending a total of million for remediation and control  including million relating to the wilmington  california properties 
the majority of accrued environmental liability as of december  is expected to be paid out over the next five years  funded by cash generated from operations 
based on current rules and regulations  management does not expect future environmental obligations to have a material impact on the results of operations or financial condition of the company 
year issue the company has adopted a year readiness program and an implementation plan 
the company is in the process of conducting a comprehensive evaluation and assessment of the business risks and exposures related to the coming change in the century 
these business risks and exposures relate to the problem present in certain software and embedded logic control devices to recognize the change in the century 
if not corrected  such software and devices could fail or create erroneous results by or at the year since  the company has replaced all major information systems with year compliance as a criterion  therefore  the company does not currently expect to incur any material amount of expense associated with its remediation of its major information systems 
with respect to the risks and exposures related to the company s customers  partners  suppliers  financial institutions and other constituencies and the resulting potential impact on the company s business operations and financial condition  the company has initiated formal communications with its customers  partners  suppliers  financial institutions and other constituencies to mitigate or prevent such risks and exposures 
the extent of such risks and exposures will be assessed and evaluated 
the evaluation and assessment of the extent of the risks and exposures related to the company s information systems  including embedded logic devices  and the company s customers  partners  suppliers  financial institutions  and other constituencies  should be substantially completed during the company has retained a consultant to advise the company in the evaluation and assessment phase of the implementation plan 
the costs associated with the year readiness program and its implementation are not currently expected to be material 
until the evaluation and assessment is completed  the company can not have a reasonable basis to conclude that the risks and exposures related to the year will not materially affect future financial results  or cause reported financial information not to reflect fairly the future operating results  cash flows or financial condition of the company
