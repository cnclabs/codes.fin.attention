the company s earnings growth has historically resulted from the acquisition of long term and subacute care facilities facilities  use of its long term and subacute care operations as a base for expansion of its ancillary services  provision of ancillary services to nonaffiliated facilities and expansion of ancillary services through acquisitions 
under the current medicare reimbursement system  ancillary services  such as rehabilitation and respiratory therapy services and pharmaceutical services  have significantly higher operating margins than the margins associated with the provision of routine services to patients at long term and subacute care facilities and accordingly have provided more than half of the company s operating profits 
the higher operating margins from the provision of ancillary services are primarily attributable to more favorable reimbursement rates 
in addition  a substantial portion of the company s consolidated interest expense was attributable to the company s long term and sub acute services and its foreign operations due to the capital intensive nature of these businesses and to related acquisitions 
the company believes that when medicare implements a prospective payment system pps for long term and subacute care services it may be better able than some of its competitors to respond to the new pps environment because it provides more types of ancillary services in house and to nonaffiliated facilities than many of its competitors

the company s effective tax rate was for the year ended december  after excluding the loss on the sale of the canadian operations and was for the year ended december  after excluding the investigation and litigation charge 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was due to a more favorable mix of state income in the united states than in the prior year 
the effective tax rate is expected to increase during primarily due to a less favorable mix of state income in the united states and the increased amount of nondeductible goodwill resulting primarily from the acquisition of regency 
net earnings were million for the year ended december  as compared to net earnings of million for the year ended december  net earnings were million for the year ended december  before the extraordinary loss  as compared to net earnings of million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenues  net earnings before the extraordinary loss were for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  net earnings before the extraordinary loss and the loss on sale of the canadian operations for the year ended december  were million or as a percentage of net revenues and net earnings before the investigation and litigation costs for the year ended december  were million  or as a percentage of net revenues

operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to negative revenue adjustments recorded by the company during the fourth quarter of as discussed above 
in addition  the increase can also be attributed to newly developed facilities opened during and  which  during the start up period  have experienced lower operating margins as the company implements its operating strategies  and to increased operating costs without a corresponding increase in billing rates due to competitive pressures 
seasonal declines in therapist productivity during the holiday season in the fourth quarter also contributed to the decrease

the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of on december  under sfas  an impairment loss is recognized if the sum of the expected long term cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the goodwill and other assets being evaluated 
the difference between the carrying amount of the goodwill and other assets being evaluated and the estimated fair market value of the assets represents the impairment loss 
the company determines fair value using certain multiples of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization based on current prices for comparable assets 
the impairment loss  as determined in accordance with sfas  of million recorded by the company primarily relates to the goodwill associated with six of the forty facilities acquired in the mediplex acquisition 
the impairment loss at these six facilities was the result of the following circumstances i three facilities were organized by the service employees international union subsequent to the acquisition resulting in significantly higher labor costs  ii two facilities experienced significant declines in private pay census and revenues due to  in one instance  funding reductions in certain programs providing private pay patients and  in the other instance  the opening of two new facilities by competitors  and iii the remaining facility received lower than expected medicaid rates from the state of connecticut and due to the high acuity of the patients treated at the facility  reimbursement was not adequate 
if the company had not elected early adoption of sfas  the impairment loss would have been based solely on the difference between the assets carrying value and cumulative long term cash flows which would have resulted in a loss of million 
the operations of the impaired facilities are not material to the consolidated earnings or cash flows of the company  and therefore  management does not expect future operating results of the impaired facilities to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company s effective tax rate was for the year ended december  after excluding the investigation and litigation charge  and was unchanged from the pro forma effective tax rate for the year ended december  after excluding the conversion fee  the merger expenses  the impairment loss and the deferred tax charge relating to the conversion of suncare from a s corporation to a c corporation upon merging with the company 
the pro forma provision for income taxes for the year ended december  reflects tax expense that would have been recorded if suncare had been subject to and liable for federal and state income taxes as a c corporation prior to the termination of its s corporation status in may net earnings were million for the year ended december  as compared to a pro forma net loss of million for the year ended december  net earnings decreased from net earnings of million before the extraordinary loss for early extinguishment of debt  the conversion fee  the merger expenses  the strike  the investigation and litigation costs  the impairment loss  and the deferred tax charge the extraordinary or unusual charges for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  before the investigation and litigation charge 
as a percentage of net revenues  net earnings were for the year ended december  before the investigation and litigation charge  as compared to for the year ended december  before the extraordinary or unusual charges

the net cash provided by operations for the year ended december  reflects the company s growth in net earnings  receipt of million from the company s director and officer liability insurance carrier and timing of certain obligations of the company 
this was offset by an increase in the net cash used for operations to fund an increase in accounts receivable 
the company s accounts receivable have increased since december  accounts receivable increased in part because of the growth in the company s inpatient  therapy and pharmaceutical services businesses since december  the growth in accounts receivable is also attributable to timing of third party reimbursement payments received by the company subsequent to year end and settlement of prior year cost reports during late in addition  fiscal intermediaries of long term care facilities acquired by the company are changed to the company s fiscal intermediary resulting in temporary delays in timing of third party payments 
the company is in the process of changing fiscal intermediaries related to facilities acquired from regency and other acquisitions which occurred during the latter half of this process could result in delays in receiving reimbursement from third party payors 
accounts receivable for therapy services have also increased in part because the ability of nonaffiliated facilities to provide timely payments has been impacted by their receipt of payments from fiscal intermediaries which  in some instances  have been delayed due to the fiscal intermediaries conducting reviews of facilities therapy claims 
accounts receivable also increased during the year ended december  due to the increased number of filings for requests for additional reimbursement of costs based on exceptions to the medicare established routine cost limitations for reimbursement rcls for which payment has been delayed pending settlement of the respective cost reports 
these exceptions are permitted under the medicare regulations to reimburse providers for the costs of treating higher acuity patients than are routinely seen in a long term care facility 
included in net revenues are amounts related to exceptions to the rcls of million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these amounts represent management s estimate  based on its prior experience with the medicare program s regulations and the company s records of services provided  of amounts that will ultimately be approved and paid by its fiscal intermediaries 
accounts receivable include requests for exceptions to the rcls of million and million as of december  and  respectively including million of rcl s related to facilities acquired from regency as of december  amounts realizable are subject to final settlement of the respective cost reports and no assurance can be given that management s estimate will be accurate upon such final settlement 
under pps  facilities will still be required to file medicare cost reports  however since medicare will pay nursing facilities on a fixed fee per patient day as described below from the time pps becomes effective  the company s revenues will no longer be tied to such settlement process

the company has also agreed to acquire the remaining of contour not presently owned by retirement care for approximately million  payable in the company s common stock or cash  at the option of the company the contour merger 
the contour merger will be accounted for as a purchase 
based upon a review of retirement care s  contour s and the company s publicly available historical financial statements  the rca and contour mergers would have had a dilutive impact on the company s reported earnings per share for the year ended december  there can be no assurance that the future combined results will not continue to be dilutive 
costs to be incurred in connection with the mergers of retirement care and contour are expected to be significant and will be charged against earnings of the combined company 
the charge is currently estimated to be approximately million for transaction costs and integration expenses  including elimination of redundant corporate functions  severance costs related to headcount reductions  the write off of certain intangibles and property and equipment and the settlement of certain class action lawsuits described below 
approximately million of these estimated charges are expected to be charged to operations in the fiscal quarter in which the rca merger is consummated 
approximately million of the estimated charges relating to the integration expenses are expected to be expensed as incurred as these costs will benefit future combined operations 
these amounts are preliminary estimates only and are  therefore  subject to change 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will not incur additional charges in subsequent quarters to reflect costs associated with the rca merger and the contour merger 
as of december   the company has incurred approximately million in transaction costs as described above 
on january   the company loaned retirement care million in order to enable retirement care to cause the repayment of certain indebtedness incurred by contour in connection with contour s acquisition of atlantic medical supply company  inc atlantic on august  on july   the company and retirement care amended the terms of the loan to i increase the applicable interest rate by  ii extend the maturity date to days after the termination of the retirement care merger agreement  and iii replace the collateral securing the loan with a second lien on all of retirement care s accounts receivable

the foreign operations accounted for  and of the company s total net revenues during the year ended december   and  respectively  and of the company s consolidated total assets as of december  the company s financial condition and results of operations are subject to foreign exchange risk 
because of the company s foreign growth strategies  the company does not expect to repatriate funds invested overseas and  therefore  foreign currency transaction exposure is not normally hedged 
exceptional planned foreign currency cash flow requirements  such as acquisitions overseas  are hedged selectively to prevent fluctuations in the anticipated foreign currency value 
changes in the net worth of the company s foreign subsidiaries arising from currency fluctuations are accumulated in the translation adjustments component of stockholders equity

based on the company s interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and outstanding borrowings as of december   aggregate interest payments related to the company s long term debt for the next five years are expected to be approximately million in  million in  million in  million in  and million in the amounts of scheduled principal and interest payments related to the company s long term debt are subject to changes which may be significant  in outstanding borrowings  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s ongoing capital requirements relate to  among other things  the costs associated with its facilities under construction  routine capital expenditures  advances under the financing facility  potential acquisitions and implementation of growth strategies

there can be no assurance that the company will seek or obtain additional sources of financing in the next twelve months 
in addition  such additional financing  if any  may be subject to certain restrictions including mandatory prepayment provisions in the credit facility or otherwise require approval of various lenders under the company s credit facility 
in november and in march  the company amended its shelf registration statement on form s to  among other things  increase the amount of securities which may be sold thereunder to billion  which sales are subject to the registration statement being declared effective by the securities and exchange commission 
in the event the company offers securities thereunder  the company may be required to repay indebtedness under the credit facility 
if such sources of financing are not available  the company may not be able to pursue growth opportunities as actively as it has in the past  and may be required to alter certain of its operating strategies 
effects from changes in reimbursement the company derives a substantial percentage of its total revenues from medicare  medicaid and private insurance 
the company s financial condition and results of operations may be affected by the revenue reimbursement process  which is complex and can involve lengthy delays between the recognition of revenue and the time reimbursement amounts are settled 
net revenues realizable under third party payor agreements are subject to change due to examination and retroactive adjustment by payors during the settlement process 
payors may disallow in whole or in part requests for reimbursement based on determinations that certain costs are not reimbursable or reasonable or because additional supporting documentation is necessary 
the company recognizes revenues from third party payors and accrues estimated settlement amounts in the period in which the related services are provided 
the company estimates these settlement balances by making determinations based on its prior settlement experience and its understanding of the applicable reimbursement rules and regulations 
the majority of third party payor balances are settled two to three years following the provision of services 
the company has experienced differences between the net amounts accrued and subsequent settlements  which differences are recorded in operations at the time of settlement 
for example  in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded negative revenue adjustments totalling approximately million resulting from changes in accounting estimates of amounts realizable from third party payors 
these changes in accounting estimates primarily arose out of the settlement in late of certain facility cost reports for and and also include estimated charges for projected settlements in accounts receivable have also increased in part because the ability of nonaffiliated facilities to provide timely payments has been impacted by their receipt of payments from fiscal intermediaries which  in some instances  have been delayed due to the fiscal intermediaries conducting reviews of facilities therapy claims 
the company s results of operations would be materially and adversely affected if the amounts actually received from third party payors in any reporting period differs materially from the amounts accrued in prior periods 
the company s financial condition and results of operations may also be affected by the timing of reimbursement payments and rate adjustments from third party payors 
the company has from time to time experienced delays in receiving final settlement and reimbursement from government agencies 
various cost containment measures adopted by governmental and private pay sources have begun to restrict the scope and amount of reimbursable healthcare expenses and limit increases in reimbursement rates for medical services 
any reductions in reimbursement levels under medicaid  medicare or private payor programs and any changes in applicable government regulations or interpretations of existing regulations could significantly affect the company s profitability 
furthermore  government programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes  retroactive rate adjustments  administrative rulings and government funding restrictions  all of which may materially affect the rate of payment to the company s facilities and its therapy and pharmaceutical businesses 
there can be no assurance that payments under governmental or private payor programs will remain at levels comparable to present levels or will be adequate to cover the costs of providing services to patients eligible for assistance under such programs 
significant decreases in utilization  changes in reimbursement  including salary equivalency and pps  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations  including the possible impairment of certain assets 
in the balanced budget act of bba  congress passed numerous changes to the reimbursement policies applicable to exempt hospital services  skilled nursing  therapy and other ancillary services 
the bba generally provides for a phase in of a prospective payment system for skilled nursing facilities over a four year period  effective for the company s facilities on january  under pps  medicare will pay skilled nursing facilities a fixed fee per patient day based on the acuity level of the patient to cover all post hospital extended care routine service costs ie medicare part a patients  including ancillary and capital related costs for beneficiaries receiving skilled services 
the per diem rate will also cover substantially all items and services furnished during a covered stay for which reimbursement is currently made separately under medicare 
such services are currently reimbursed on a pass through basis 
during the phase in  payments will be based on a blend of the facility s historical costs and a federally established per diem rate 
since  among other things  the federally established per diem rates have not been finalized  it is unclear what impact pps will have on the company 
there can be no assurance that pps will not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of the company 
the company s revenues from its inpatient facilities will be significantly affected by the size of the federally established per diem rate 
there can be no assurance that the per diem rate will not be less than the amount the company s inpatient facilities currently receive for treating the patients currently in its care 
moreover  since the company treats a greater percentage of higher acuity patient than many nursing homes  the company may also be adversely impacted if the federal per diem rates for higher acuity patients does not adequately compensate the company for the additional expenses and risks for caring for such patients 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the company s financial condition and results of operations will not be materially and adversely affected 
the company is responding to the implementation of pps by establishing sunsolution registered trademark 
sunsolution will offer to provide ancillary services for a fixed fee to nonaffiliated facilities 
there can be no assurance that there will be a market for the sunsolution products and services or whether a change in the demand for the company s services following the imposition of pps will not adversely affect the company s revenues 
even if sunsolution is successful  no assurance can be given that the costs of providing the contracted for services will be less than the fixed fee received by the company for such services 
given the relative profitability of sun s ancillary services  there can be no assurance that the company s margins and ultimately the company s results of operations and financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  for all medicare patients not receiving post hospital extended care services ie medicare part b patients  effective july   reimbursement for ancillary services  including rehabilitation therapy  medical supplies  pharmacy  temporary staffing for rehabilitation therapy  and other ancillary services  will be made pursuant to yet to be developed fee schedules 
in addition  effective january   there will be an annual per beneficiary cap of  on reimbursement for outpatient physical therapy and speech therapy and an annual per beneficiary cap of  on reimbursement for occupational therapy 
facilities will be permitted to bill patients directly for services rendered in excess of these caps  provided however  there can be no assurance as to whether the company will receive any payments in excess of these caps 
there can be no assurance whether such yet to be developed fee schedules or caps will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s growth strategy relies heavily on the acquisition of long term and subacute care facilities 
regardless of the legal form of the acquisition  the medicare and medicaid programs often require that the company assume certain obligations relating to the reimbursement paid to the former operators of the facilities acquired by the company 
from time to time  fiscal intermediaries and medicaid agencies examine cost reports filed by such predecessor operators 
the company is currently the subject of several such examinations 
if  as a result of any such examinations  it is concluded that overpayments to a predecessor operator were made  the company  as the current operator of such facilities  may be held financially responsible for such overpayments 
at this time the company is unable to predict the outcome of any existing or future examinations 
reimbursement for therapy services is currently evaluated under medicare s reasonable cost principles 
under current law  the reasonable costs for physical therapy and respiratory services may not exceed an amount equal to the salary that would reasonably have been paid to a therapist for providing the services together with certain additional costs within each geographical area 
salary equivalency guidelines are the amounts published by the health care financing administration hcfa which reflect the prevailing salary  fringe benefit and expense factors as determined by hcfa 
hcfa then uses the salary equivalency guidelines to determine the reimbursement rates for physical therapy and respiratory therapy costs 
although salary equivalency guidelines will no longer be effective following the implementation of pps and fee schedule reimbursement  hcfa has published new salary equivalency guidelines 
on january   hcfa revised salary equivalency guidelines for respiratory therapy and physical therapy  and for the first time published new salary equivalency guidelines for speech therapy and occupational therapy 
hcfa has indicated that the new salary equivalency guidelines would apply to all services rendered on or after april  implementation of these guidelines will increase reimbursement rates for respiratory therapy and physical therapy  but reduce reimbursement rates for speech therapy and occupational therapy 
the implementation of these new guidelines in the middle of a facility s fiscal year may be contrary to hcfa s own regulations  and a request has been submitted to hcfa to clarify the implementation schedule 
if implemented  the effect of the changes could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
the salary equivalency guidelines rates will have no continuing impact on reimbursement for therapy services rendered to a medicare patient receiving post hospital extended care services following the commencement of pps  because under pps  therapy services will be bundled into each facility s per diem reimbursement from medicare 
in addition  the salary equivalency guidelines will have no continuing impact on therapy services rendered to all other medicare patients after the institution of fee schedule reimbursement for therapy services  which the bba provides will be effective on july  additionally  if the proposed guidelines are adopted  it could have an adverse effect on the cash flow of the facilities to whom the company provides services  thereby potentially adversely affecting the collectibility of amounts owed to the company 
in  and periodically since then  hcfa has provided information to intermediaries for use in determining reasonable costs for occupational and speech therapy 
this information  although not intended to impose limits on such costs  suggests that fiscal intermediaries should carefully review costs which appear to be in excess of what a prudent buyer would pay for those services 
while the effect of these directives is still uncertain  they are a factor considered by such intermediaries in evaluating the reasonableness of amounts paid by providers for the services of the company s rehabilitation therapy subsidiary 
when salary equivalency guidelines  pps and fee schedules are implemented  reimbursement for these services will no longer be on a pass through basis and the hcfa directives and reasonable cost guidelines discussed in this paragraph will become moot as to services rendered after their effectiveness 
in addition  some intermediaries require facilities to justify the cost of contract therapists versus employed therapists as an aspect of the prudent buyer analysis 
with respect to rehabilitation therapy services provided to affiliated facilities  a retroactive adjustment of medicare reimbursement could be made for some prior periods 
with respect to nonaffiliated facilities  an adjustment of reimbursement rates for therapy services could result in indemnity claims against the company  based on the terms of substantially all of the company s existing contracts with such facilities  for payments previously made by such facilities to the company that are reduced by medicare in the audit process 
any change in reimbursement rates resulting from implementation of the hcfa directives or a reduction in reimbursement as a result of a change in application of reasonable cost guidelines could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations depending on the rates adopted and customers ability to pay for prior and continuing services 
when pps with respect to medicare part a effective for the company s facilities on january  and fee schedules with respect to medicare part b effective july  are implemented  the company s facilities reimbursement will no longer be affected by salary equivalency guidelines and the cost reporting settlement process for services rendered after their effectiveness 
current medicare regulations that apply to transactions between related parties  such as the company s subsidiaries  are relevant to the amount of medicare reimbursement that the company is entitled to receive for the rehabilitation and respiratory therapy and pharmaceutical services that it provides to company operated facilities 
these related party regulations require that  among other things  a substantial part of the rehabilitation and respiratory therapy services or pharmaceutical services  as the case may be  of the relevant subsidiary be transacted with nonaffiliated entities in order for the company to receive reimbursement for services provided to company operated facilities at the rates applicable to services provided to nonaffiliated entities 
the related party regulations do not indicate a specific level of services that must be provided to nonaffiliated entities in order to satisfy the substantial part requirement of such regulations 
in instances where this issue has been litigated by others  no consistent standard has emerged as to the appropriate threshold necessary to satisfy the substantial part requirement 
the company s net revenues from rehabilitation therapy services  including net revenues from temporary therapy staffing services  provided to nonaffiliated facilities represented  and of total rehabilitation and temporary therapy staffing services net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
respiratory therapy services provided to nonaffiliated facilities represented   and of total respiratory therapy services net revenues for the years ended december   and the period from the date of acquisition of suncare on may  to december   respectively 
the company s respiratory therapy operations did not provide services to affiliated facilities prior to the acquisition of suncare on may  net revenues from pharmaceutical services billed to nonaffiliated facilities represented  and of total pharmaceutical services revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company believes that it satisfies the requirements of these regulations regarding nonaffiliated business 
consequently  it has claimed and received reimbursement under medicare for rehabilitation and respiratory therapy and pharmaceutical services provided to patients in its own facilities at a higher rate than if it did not satisfy these requirements 
if the company were deemed to not have satisfied these regulations  the reimbursement that the company receives for rehabilitation and respiratory therapy and pharmaceutical services provided to its own facilities would be significantly reduced  as a result of which the company s financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
if  upon audit by federal or state reimbursement agencies  such agencies find that these regulations have not been satisfied  and if  after appeal  such findings are sustained  the company could be required to refund some or all of the difference between its cost of providing these services to any entity found to be subject to the related party regulations and the higher amount actually received 
while the company believes that it has satisfied and will continue to satisfy these regulations  there can be no assurance that its position would prevail if contested by relevant reimbursement agencies 
the foregoing statements with respect to the company s ability to satisfy these regulations are forward looking and could be affected by a number of factors  including the interpretation of medicare regulations by federal or state reimbursement agencies and the company s ability to provide services to nonaffiliated facilities 
when the salary equivalency guidelines  pps and the fee schedules are implemented  the medicare impact of the related party rule will be significantly reduced 
regulation the company s subsidiaries  including those which provide subacute and long term care  rehabilitation and respiratory therapy and pharmaceutical services  are engaged in industries which are extensively regulated 
as such  in the ordinary course of business  the operations of these subsidiaries are continuously subject to state and federal regulatory scrutiny  supervision and control 
such regulatory scrutiny often includes inquiries  investigations  examinations  audits  site visits and surveys  some of which may be non routine 
the company is currently the subject of several such investigations 
in addition to being subject to the direct regulatory oversight of state and federal regulatory agencies  these industries are frequently subject to the regulatory supervision of fiscal intermediaries 
fiscal intermediaries are agents of hcfa who interpret and implement applicable laws and regulations and make decisions about the appropriate reimbursement to be paid under medicare and medicaid 
the company s subsidiaries are subject to the oversight of several different intermediaries 
those different intermediaries have taken varying interpretations of the applicable laws and regulations 
the lack of uniformity in the interpretation and implementation of such laws and regulations reflects in part the fact that the statutory standards are subject to interpretation and the manuals which are published and utilized by hcfa and the intermediaries in performing their regulatory functions are often not sufficiently specific to provide clear guidance in the areas which are the subject of regulatory scrutiny 
it is the policy of the company to comply with all applicable laws and regulations  and the company believes that its subsidiaries are in substantial compliance with all material laws and regulations which are applicable to their businesses 
however  given the extent to which the interpretation and implementation of applicable laws and regulations vary and the lack of clear guidance in many of the areas which are the subject of regulatory scrutiny  there can be no assurance that the business activities of the company s subsidiaries will not from time to time become the subject of regulatory scrutiny  or that such scrutiny will not result in interpretations of applicable laws or regulations by government regulators or intermediaries which differ materially from those taken by the company s subsidiaries 
in addition  if the company is ever found to have engaged in improper practices  it could be subject to civil  administrative or criminal fines  penalties or restitutionary relief 
in january  the company learned that it was the subject of a pending federal investigation 
the investigating agencies are the united states department of health and human services office of inspector general oig and the united states department of justice 
at this time  the company does not know the full scope of the investigation 
however  the company currently believes that the investigation is focused principally on whether the company provided and billed for unnecessary or unordered therapy services to residents of skilled nursing facilities and whether the company adequately documented the therapy services which it provided 
in july  the criminal division of the us department of justice informed the company that it had completed its investigation of the company  and that it would not initiate any actions against the company or any individuals 
the investigation by the civil division of the department of justice and the oig is still proceeding 
the government continues to collect information  and the company continues to cooperate with the investigators 
the company and the government have had preliminary discussions  and the company expects to have continuing discussions  regarding a possible settlement of the investigation 
the company is unable to determine at this time when the investigation will be concluded  how large a monetary settlement the government may seek  the nature of any other remedies that may be sought by the government  whether or when a settlement will in fact occur or whether any such settlement or any other outcome of the investigation will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the foregoing statements with respect to the outcome of the investigation are forward looking and could be affected by a number of factors  including the actual scope of the investigation  the government s factual findings and the interpretation of federal statutes and regulations by the government and federal courts and whether any such factual findings could serve as a basis for proceedings by other governmental authorities 
from time to time the negative publicity surrounding the investigation has in the past adversely affected the private pay enrollment in certain inpatient facilities and slowed the company s success in obtaining additional outside contracts in the rehabilitation therapy business  which resulted in higher than required therapist staffing levels 
negative publicity in the future could have a similar effect 
in  the connecticut attorney general s office and the connecticut department of social services dss began an investigation and initiated a hearing in order to determine whether the company s long term care subsidiary submitted false and misleading fiscal information on its and medicaid cost reports 
in  the dss began an investigation of information submitted for the cost year as well as cost reporting periods prior to the evidentiary phase of the hearing has concluded  but the proceedings are still in progress and the company is unable to determine at this time when the investigation will be concluded or whether the evidence will warrant further administrative action or medicaid reimbursement sanctions by dss 
however  based on the company s current understanding of the investigation  the company does not believe the investigation will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the foregoing statement with regard to the outcome of this investigation is forward looking and could be affected by a number of factors  including factual findings and the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations by the attorney general and the dss and whether any such factual findings could serve as a basis for proceedings by other governmental authorities in connecticut or elsewhere 
pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act of  congress has provided additional funding to medicare and medicaid enforcement units to investigate potential cases of reimbursement abuse in the health care services industry 
the act also sets guidelines to encourage federal  state  and local law enforcement agencies to share general information and to coordinate specific law enforcement activities including conducting investigations  audits  evaluations  and inspections relating to the delivery of and payment for health care 
from time to time enforcement agencies conduct audits  inspections and investigations with respect to the reimbursement activities of the subsidiaries of the company 
the company is currently the subject of several such investigations 
it is the company s practice to cooperate fully in such matters 
litigation on or about january   two former stockholders of suncare  john brennan and susan bird  filed a lawsuit the suncare litigation against the company and certain of its officers and directors in the united states district court for the southern district of indiana 
plaintiffs allege  among other things  that the company did not disclose material facts concerning the investigation by the oig and that the company s financial results were misstated 
the complaints purport to state claims  inter alia  under federal and state securities laws and for breach of contract  including a breach of a registration rights agreement pursuant to which the company agreed to register the shares of the company s common stock issued to such former stockholders of suncare in the acquisition 
plaintiffs purport to seek recision  unspecified compensatory damages  punitive damages and other relief 
the trial is currently scheduled to begin in the summer of the company believes the suncare litigation will not have a material adverse impact on its financial condition or results of operations  although the unfavorable resolution of this action in any reporting period could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations for that period 
the foregoing statements with respect to the possible outcome of the suncare litigation are forward looking and could be affected by a number of factors  including judicial interpretations of applicable law  the uncertainties and risk inherent in any litigation  particularly a jury trial  the existence and scope of any subsequently filed complaints  the scope of insurance coverage  and the outcome of the oig investigation and all factors that could affect that outcome 
on september   a derivative action was filed by brickell partners against certain of the company s current and former directors and officers in the united states district court for the district of new mexico  captioned brickell partners v 
turner  et al 
the complaint was not served on any defendant 
on june   an amended complaint alleging breach of fiduciary duty by certain of the company s current and former directors and officers was filed and subsequently served on the defendants 
on august   the district court dismissed this action without prejudice for failure to serve the defendants within the required time period 
the plaintiffs filed a new complaint  alleging the same claims  on august  in december  the company and the plaintiffs reached an agreement in principle to settle the action for an immaterial amount 
the settlement is subject to definitive documentation and court approval 
the company was notified in by a law firm representing several national insurance companies that these companies believed that the company had engaged in improper billing and other practices in connection with the company s delivery of therapy and related services 
in response  the company began discussions directly with these insurers and hopes to resolve these matters without litigation  however  the company is unable at this time to predict whether it will be able to do so  what the eventual outcome may be or the extent of its liability  if any  to these insurers 
year issue in common with users of computers around the world  the company is investigating if and to what extent the date change from to may affect its networks and systems 
the company has established and implemented a program designed to minimize the impact of the transition to the year on the company and its customers by seeking to cause the company s key networks and systems and the networks and systems of its vendors to be year compliant before december  the company expects to incur internal staff costs  external consulting costs  and other expenses related to infrastructure and facility enhancement necessary to prepare the systems for the year although the total cost to the company of achieving year compliant systems is not expected to be material to the company s operations or financial condition  there can be no assurance that the costs will be as expected or that this program will be successful or that the date change from to will not materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the ability of third parties with which the company transacts business to adequately address their year issues is outside the company s control 
although the company will seek alternative vendors  where its current vendors are unwilling or unable to become year compliant in a timely manner  there can be no assurance that the company s operations will not be materially adversely affected by the ability of third parties dealing with the company  including medicare and medicaid  to also manage the effect of the year date change 
effects of inflation healthcare costs have been rising and are expected to continue to rise at a rate higher than that anticipated for consumer goods as a whole 
the company s operations could be adversely affected if it experiences significant delays in receiving reimbursement rate increases from medicaid and medicare sources for its labor and other costs
