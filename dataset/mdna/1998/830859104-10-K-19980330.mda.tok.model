the words and phrases should be  will be  believes  expects  anticipates  plans  intends  may and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements reflect the company s current views with respect to future events and financial performance  but are subject to many uncertainties and factors relating to the company s operations and business environment which may cause the actual results of the company to be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by such forward looking statements

the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
risk factors limited history of profitable operations  no assurance of continued profitability 
the company commenced operations in late  and prior to the company incurred substantial losses 
there can be no assurance that the company s operations will remain profitable 
no assurance of continued growth 
since its inception  skymall has rapidly expanded its operations  growing from total revenues of million in to total revenues of million in the company s continued growth will depend to a significant degree on its ability to increase revenue per passenger  broaden its customer base by entering into relationships with new domestic and foreign airlines  and implement other programs that increase the circulation of the skymall catalog 
the company s ability to implement its growth strategy will also depend on a number of other factors  many of which are or may be beyond the company s control  including i the ability of the company to select products for its catalog that appeal to its customer base  ii sustained or increased levels of airline travel  particularly in domestic airline markets  iii the continued perception by participating merchants that the company offers an effective marketing channel for their products and services  iv the company s ability to attract  train  and retain qualified employees and management  and v the continued profitability of existing operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully implement its growth strategy or that its planned expansion will be profitable 
dependence on airline relationships 
the company s business depends significantly on its relationships with airlines and its ability to have its catalogs placed on a substantial portion of domestic airline flights 
the company s agreements with its airline partners typically have one year terms  but generally permit the airline to terminate the relationship on to days advance notice 
there can be no assurance that the company s airline partners will continue their relationships with the company and the loss of one or more of the company s significant airline partners could have a material adverse affect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
increases in paper costs and airline fuel prices 
the cost of paper used to print the company s catalogs and the fees paid to airlines to reimburse them for the increased fuel costs associated with carrying the company s catalogs are significant expenses of the company s operations 
historically  paper and airline fuel prices have fluctuated significantly from time to time 
prices in the paper market remain volatile and the company anticipates that its paper costs will increase in in comparison to any significant increases in paper or airline fuel costs reimbursable by the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
credit risk 
some participating merchants agree to pay a placement fee to the company for inclusion of their merchandise in the skymall catalog 
the company records an account receivable from the merchant for the placement fee ratably for each month of the catalog issue 
in some cases  the company collects the placement fee either from the merchant or by withholding it from amounts due to the merchant for merchandise sold 
to the extent that the placement fee receivable exceeds the sales of the merchant s products and the merchant is unable or unwilling to pay the difference to the company  the company may experience credit losses which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
competition 
from time to time  competitors  typically other catalog retailers  have attempted to secure contracts with airlines to offer merchandise to their passengers 
in  northwest airlines began offering a merchandise catalog to its customers through a competitor of the company 
various international airlines also offer merchandise catalogs to their passengers through competitors of the company 
the company also faces competition for customers from airport based retailers  duty free retailers  specialty stores  department stores  and specialty and general merchandise catalogs  many of which have greater financial and marketing resources than the company 
in addition  the company competes for customers with other in flight marketing media  such as airline sponsored in flight magazines and airline video programming 
all of the products and services offered by the company can also be found in other retail stores and catalogs 
reliance on information and telecommunications systems 
the company processes a large volume of relatively small orders 
consequently  the company s success depends to a significant degree on the effective operation of its information and telecommunications systems 
any extended failure of the company s information and telecommunications systems could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
year compliance 
many software programs use only two digits to identify the year in the date field 
if such programs are not corrected  date data concerning the year could cause many computer applications to fail  lock up or generate erroneous results 
the company has committed personnel and resources to resolve potential year issues  and is in the process of identifying and assessing its mission critical systems related to the year although the company plans to address year issues with respect to its mission critical internal systems in sufficient time prior to the century rollover  there can be no assurance that there will not be interruption of operations or other limitations of system functionality  or that the company will not incur substantial costs to avoid such occurrences 
there can also be no assurance that there will not be interruption of operations as a result of potential limitations of systems of the parties with whom the company has relationships for product fulfillment and distribution 
the company is currently assessing the cost to remediate its year issues 
although the actual cost to remediate these issues is not yet fully known  based upon information to date  it is not expected that the remediation will have a material impact on the company s financial condition or operating results 
seasonality 
the company s business is seasonal in nature  with its sales peak typically occurring during the holiday selling season of the fourth quarter 
during  approximately percent of the company s net merchandise sales were generated in the fourth quarter 
any substantial decrease in sales for the fourth quarter could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
product liability 
the company s catalog typically features over  products and services from more than participating merchants 
generally  the company s agreements with its participating merchants require the merchants to indemnify the company for any losses arising from product liability claims made by customers  including the costs of defending any such claims  and to carry product liability insurance that names skymall as an additional insured 
in addition  the company maintains product liability insurance in the aggregate amount of million and million per occurrence 
to the extent that a merchant was unable or unwilling to indemnify the company as required  and any such losses exceeded the company s insurance coverage or were not covered by the company s insurer  the company s financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
reliance on key personnel 
the company is dependent on the services of robert m 
worsley  its chairman  president and chief executive officer  and on the services of certain other executive officers 
the loss of mr 
worsley s services or of the services of certain other executive officers could have a material adverse effect on the company 
control by shareholder 
as of march   mr 
worsley and his wife the worsleys own and have options to purchase approximately of the company s outstanding common stock 
accordingly  the worsleys have the ability to significantly influence the affairs of the company and matters requiring a shareholder vote  including the election of the company s directors  the amendment of the company s charter documents  the merger or dissolution of the company  and the sale of all or substantially all of the company s assets 
the voting power of the worsleys may also discourage or prevent any proposed takeover of the company pursuant to a tender offer 
volatility of stock prices 
the trading price of the common stock is subject to wide fluctuations in response to variations in the company s operating results  announcements by the company or others  developments affecting the company or its competitors  and other events and factors 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years 
these fluctuations have had a substantial effect on the market prices for many companies  often unrelated to their performance  and may adversely affect the market price for the company s common stock 
no dividends 
the company has not paid dividends on its common stock since its inception and does not expect to pay cash or stock dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable future 
issuance of preferred stock  barriers to takeover 
the board of directors may issue one or more series of preferred stock  without any action on the part of the shareholders of the company  the terms of which may adversely affect the rights of holders of common stock 
further  the issuance of preferred stock may be used as an anti takeover device without further action on the part of the shareholders 
issuance of preferred stock  which may be accomplished through a public offering or a private placement to parties favorable to current management  may dilute the voting power of holders of common stock such as by issuing preferred stock with super voting rights and may render more difficult the removal of current management  even if such removal may be in the shareholders best interests 
any such issuance of preferred stock could prevent the holders of common stock from realizing a premium on their shares 
the company s articles of incorporation and bylaws also contain a certain number of provisions which could deter takeover attempts
