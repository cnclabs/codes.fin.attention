results of operations fiscal and fiscal consolidated net sales increased in fiscal compared to a decrease of in fiscal sales for fiscal grew mainly due to the inclusion of full year results from the acquisition of medical advances  inc mai and half year results from the november  acquisition of polycold systems international  inc polycold 
in fiscal  increases in sales of both magnet systems and refrigeration products were offset by a substantial reduction in sales of superconducting materials 
as a percentage of net sales  gross margins improved again in fiscal after a good recovery in fiscal the increase in both years was due to continuing cost reduction efforts and a more favorable product mix  primarily in the magnetic products segment  despite continuing competitive pressure on selling prices for magnets and superconducting materials 
the recent acquisitions  mai and polycold  had a favorable impact on gross margins  as did improvements in fiscal for the superconducting magnets and wire businesses 
looking forward  the company expects greater sales and earnings in fiscal this expectation is based on the following assumptions  among others the market for mri systems continues to grow  the company can successfully contend with continued competitive pressure on selling prices in the mri marketplace for magnets and materials  anticipated sales of refrigerants occur  and  reductions in production costs in both business segments continue 
in addition  fiscal will include the operations of polycold for the full year 
polycold was acquired in november  as described in liquidity and capital commitments 
company funded product research and development expenses increased in fiscal  almost all of which resulted from the recent acquisitions  compared to a increase in fiscal company funded product research and development spending increased in all business segments 
because the company is no longer qualified as a small business and thus is not eligible for certain government funded research awards  external funding for research and development expenses continues to decline  and has been replaced by internal funding 
marketing  general and administrative expenses grew in fiscal compared with growth of in fiscal this was due primarily to the recent acquisitions  increased marketing expenses for apd cryogenics  and a non cash charge of  associated with the issuance of a warrant to sumitomo corporation of america in connection with a distribution agreement 
the increase in fiscal was due to the creation of two separate organizations intercool energy corporation ice in fiscal  and  imig mri  llc imig  a joint venture with surrey medical imaging systems limited smis  in fiscal ice s purpose is to develop and market frigc r refrigerants 
imig was formed to commercialize a new  low cost permanent magnet based magnetic resonance imaging system 
in fiscal  the company discontinued imig and named trex medical corporation as the exclusive world wide distributor for the imig mri system 
in fiscal the company began to separately report the amortization of intangible assets due to the significance of such expense resulting from the acquisitions of mai and polycold 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of net assets acquired for these acquisitions is being written off over years 
interest income declined in fiscal because a substantial portion of invested cash was used for acquisitions and investments in and advances to affiliates 
equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates increased because the affiliates had higher losses in the current fiscal year 
interest expense was slightly higher in fiscal principally due to the issuance of a short term note as part of the polycold acquisition and was lower in fiscal due to the repayment of  of installment notes in december  the company s effective income tax rate increased in fiscal to  up from in fiscal  due mainly to the effect of non deductible amortization of intangible assets associated with the recent acquisitions 
fiscal benefited from the utilization of certain tax credits

segment discussion magnetic products segment 
this segment consists of the design  development  manufacture and sale of superconductive magnets and materials  permanent magnets  rf coils  and other magnetic products 
sales for the segment increased in fiscal compared to a decline of in fiscal  principally due to the inclusion of mai for the full year 
magnet system sales including mai increased by in fiscal compared with an increase of in fiscal material sales increased approximately in fiscal compared to a decline of approximately in fiscal the sales decline in this segment in fiscal was principally due to substantially lower superconducting material sales to a major customer who decided not to renew a long term supply agreement 
sales to this customer increased in fiscal in fiscal gross profit margins increased for both magnet products and superconducting materials due to continued cost improvements  higher sales and improved product mix  including mai s impact on the full year 
gross margins in fiscal increased for magnet products due to a more favorable product mix and improved production costs  but declined substantially for materials due to lower sales volume and continued yield losses in wire manufacturing 
refrigeration products segment 
this segment  which consists of the design  development  manufacture and sale of cryogenic refrigeration equipment and refrigerants  had increased sales of approximately in fiscal and in fiscal fiscal includes polycold sales for six months  which slightly exceeded the reduction in sales of frigc r refrigerants and apd cryogenics refrigeration equipment due to reduced demand for both product lines 
the increase in fiscal was primarily the result of sales of fr tm refrigerant and a substantial increase in sales of laboratory and cryotiger systems 
gross margin  as a percentage of net sales  increased slightly in fiscal and in fiscal the fiscal increase was due to cost reductions for refrigerants and cryogenic refrigeration equipment

most of these costs will be capitalized 
liquidity and capital commitments in fiscal the company generated net cash of  from operating activities  which  together with available cash  was used to purchase property  plant and equipment  to make additional investments in smis and an investment in kryotech  inc  to purchase treasury stock  repay debt and to acquire polycold 
on november   the company acquired polycold of san rafael  ca  a manufacturer of low temperature refrigeration systems including water vapor cryopumps  cryocoolers  cold trap chillers and gas chillers  for an aggregate consideration of approximately  consisting of a day promissory note for   shares of the company s common stock and  shares of series a preferred stock  which is redeemable in cash or common stock at the option of the company

see the consolidated statements of cash flows in the consolidated financial statements  located elsewhere in this report  for a detailed description of the sources and uses of cash during fiscal as well as the two preceding years 
the company s capital resource commitments as of august  consisted principally of capital equipment commitments of approximately  and outstanding bank loans 
the company has a three year  unsecured  line of credit with two banks that bears interest at the london interbank offered rate libor plus  or prime less  and will expire in november   of which  was in use on august  the company believes that it will have sufficient working capital to meet its needs for the short term by using internally generated funds and existing credit facilities 
however  on a longer term basis with substantial increases in sales volume and or unusually large expenditure requirements to commercialize the frigc r family of refrigerants  the company may be required to obtain additional lines of credit for working capital purposes and possibly make periodic public offerings or private placements in order to meet the liquidity needs of such growth 
while the company does not believe it will be restricted in financing such growth  there can be no assurances that such sources of financing will be available to the company in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms 
under such circumstances  the company would expect to manage its growth within the financing available
