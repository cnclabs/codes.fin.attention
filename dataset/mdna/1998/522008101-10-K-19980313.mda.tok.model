the use of these methods of channel marketing and advertising is becoming more prevalent among the larger consumer software companies

during the year ended december   the company repurchased  of senior convertible notes 
as of february   the company has outstanding  long term principal amount senior convertible notes 
the senior convertible notes will be redeemable by the company on or after november  at declining redemption prices and are due on november  should the senior convertible notes not convert under their terms into common stock  there can be no assurances that the company will have sufficient cash flows from future operations to meet payment requirements under the debt or be able to refinance the notes under favorable terms or at all

the amounts incurred and expected to be incurred are not material 
at the present time  the company expects that its cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to finance the company s operations for at least the next twelve months 
longer term cash requirements are dictated by a number of external factors  which include the company s ability to launch new and competitive products  the strength of competition in the consumer software industry and the growth of the home computer market 
in addition  the company s remaining long term portion of the senior convertible notes totaling  mature in november if not converted to common stock  the company may be required to secure alternative financing sources 
there can be no assurance that alternative financing sources will be available on terms acceptable to the company in the future or at all 
the company continuously evaluates products and technologies for acquisitions  however no estimation of short term or long term cash requirements for such acquisitions can be made at this time 
future operating results the company operates in a rapidly changing environment that is subject to many risks and uncertainties 
some of the important risks and uncertainties which may cause the company s operating results to differ materially or adversely are discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
intense competitive environment the consumer software industry is intensely and increasingly competitive and is characterized by rapid changes in technology and customer requirements 
the company competes for retail shelf space and general consumer awareness with a number of companies that market consumer software 
the company encounters competition from both established companies  including the largest companies in the industry  and new companies that may develop comparable or superior products 
a number of the company s competitors and potential competitors possess significantly greater capital  marketing resources and brand recognition than the company 
rapid changes in technology  product obsolescence and advances in computer software and hardware require the company to develop or acquire new products and to enhance its existing products on a timely basis 
the company s marketplace has recently experienced a higher emphasis on online and internet related services and content tailored for this new delivery vehicle 
to the extent that demand increases for online products and content  the demand for the company s existing products change 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully maintain market share and otherwise compete successfully in the future 
competitive pressures in the software industry have resulted  and the company believes may continue to result  in pressure to reduce the prices of its products or risk loss of market share 
in response to such competitive pressures during early the company reduced the retail selling price of certain of its educational products 
there can be no assurance that company s product selling prices will not continue to decline in the future or that the company will not respond to such declines with additional price reductions 
such price reductions may reduce the company s revenues and operating margins in the future 
during  the company and many of its competitors began using rebate coupons in order to induce consumers to purchase their products 
in addition  the company uses various forms of prints and television advertising to enhance brand and product awareness 
the use of these methods of channel marketing and advertising is becoming more prevalent among the larger consumer software publishers 
to the extent that the company fails to match competitors future channel marketing and advertising programs  it could risk loss of market share and corresponding revenues and operating profits 
large companies with substantial bases of intellectual property content in the motion picture and media industries  sophisticated product marketing and technical abilities and or financial resources that may not need to realize an immediate profit or return on investment have increasingly entered or announced their intention to enter the consumer software market 
these competitors include microsoft  disney  mattel  hasbro and cendant corporation formerly cuc international inc 
for example  technology companies have begun to acquire greater access to content  and content oriented companies have begun to acquire greater technological capabilities 
to the extent that competitors achieve a performance  price or distribution advantage  the company could be adversely affected 
furthermore  increased consolidation of the consumer software market may impact future growth potential and performance 
in the retail distribution channel resellers typically have available a limited amount of shelf space and promotional resources 
there is intense competition for high quality and adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support from retailers 
to the extent that the number of consumer computer platforms and products increases  this competition for shelf space may also increase 
the company also competes for shelf space against non educational and reference category publishers such as games 
to the extent that these vendors acquire greater shelf space  the company s position may be reduced 
mass merchants such as wal mart and kmart are increasingly becoming a larger portion of the company s sales 
as these retailers achieve greater market share from the traditional software retailers  the company may experience higher marketing costs and increased competition for shelf space  which could impact future sales and operating margins 
additionally  as technology changes  the type and number of distribution channels will further change and new types of competitors  such as cable or telephone companies  are likely to emerge 
there can be no assurance that the company will compete effectively in these channels in the future 
the retail channels of distribution available for products are subject to rapid changes as retailers and distributors enter and exit the consumer software market or alter their product inventory preferences 
other types of retail outlets and methods of product distribution may become important in the future 
these new methods may include delivery of software using online services or the internet which will necessitate certain changes in the company s business and operations including addressing operational challenges such as improving download time for pictures  images and programs  ensuring proper regulation of content quality and developing sophisticated security for transmitting payments 
should on line distribution channels increase  the company will be required to modify its existing technology platforms in order for its products to be compatible and remain competitive 
it is critical to the success of the company that  as these changes occur  it maintain access to those channels of distribution offering software in its market segments 
new products and rapid technological change the company operates in a highly competitive and technology driven environment 
the consumer software industry is undergoing substantial change and is subject to a high level of uncertainty 
software companies must continue to develop or acquire new products or upgrade existing products on a timely basis to sustain revenues and profitable operations 
factors contributing to the short life span of pc software have included rapid technological change and an expanded demand for content rich products 
software companies must continue to create or acquire innovative new products reflecting technological changes in hardware and software and translate current products into newly accepted hardware and software formats  in order to gain and maintain a viable market for their products 
pc hardware  in particular  is steadily advancing in power and function  expanding the market for increasingly complex and flexible software products 
this has also resulted in longer periods necessary for research and development of new products and a greater degree of unpredictability in the time necessary to develop products 
furthermore  the rapid changes in the market and the increasing number of new products available to consumers have increased the degree of consumer acceptance risk with respect to any specific title that the company may publish 
it is expected that this trend will continue and may become more pronounced in the future 
similarly  the company s product content focus and enhanced presence in the educational and reference software market have required and will continue to require the company to evaluate and adopt appropriate development and marketing strategies and methods  which may differ from those historically employed by the company and subject the company to the risks and competitive pressures associated with those new strategies 
the company s rights to license many of its software products are non exclusive and  generally  of limited duration  and there is no assurance the company will be able to continue to obtain new products from developers or to maintain or expand its market share in the event that a competitor offers the same or similar software products 
if the company is unable to develop or acquire new products in a timely manner as revenues decrease from products reaching the end of their natural life cycle  the company s results of operations will be adversely affected 
certain of the company s products  such as the american girls premiere and the sesame street line of products  among others  include branded content licensed from third parties 
this content is licensed pursuant to agreements with terms of finite duration and which may contain restrictions on the company s ability to develop future products without the consent of the applicable licensor 
if the company is not able to develop future products under these agreements or enter into alternative arrangements with the same or additional licensors  the company s operating results could be adversely affected 
dependence on major supplier in  the production  assembly and distribution of the company s north american line of products was performed by two units of bertelsmann ag collectively  bmg  with the exception of school channel products and certain oem products 
the company believes that its existing production capacity is sufficient to handle anticipated increases in volume and titles into the foreseeable future 
although the company believes that suitable alternative suppliers exist  there can be no assurance that any termination or modification of its arrangement with bmg would not result in a short term business interruption for the company 
effect of new accounting pronouncement for the year ended december   the company adopted statement of accounting standards no
