such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
the risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations  performance  development and results of the company s business primarily include inability to complete a business combination  sale of assets or strategic alliance  inability to obtain additional debt or equity financing  delisting of the company s common stock on nasdaq  termination of the company s facility lease  delays in shipment or cancellation of orders  timing of future orders  customer reorganization  fluctuations in demand primarily associated with governmental mandates for the production of zero emission vehicles and the ability to successfully commercialize the horizon battery 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements which speak only as of the date hereof 
the company undertakes no obligation to republish revised forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
readers are also urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by the company which attempt to advise interested parties of the factors which affect the company s business in this report and in the company s periodic reports on forms q and k filed with the securities and exchange commission 
results of operations as a result of much lower than anticipated mandate related sales of lead acid batteries in  the company refocused efforts in on relationships with customers  sales of production batteries and continued development of prototype batteries for a variety of electric vehicle ev hybrid electric vehicle hev  lawn and garden  electric scooter  aircraft starting and other applications in domestic and international markets driven by consumer demand rather than by government legislation 
strategic alliances with customers and organizations were also sought to aid penetration of target markets and assist financially 
during late and  the company developed cooperative development agreements with companies and government agencies such as black decker portable power tools  lockheed martin hevs  fiat auto fiat evs and hevs  smh automobile s 
a 
smh hevs  the defense advanced project agency darpa evs and hevs  and horizon aircraft aircraft starting 
additionally  the company entered into a strategic business relationship with corning incorporated corning in the company received  in funding in the form of convertible notes payable from corning in and early and also entered into a technical development agreement with corning in the third quarter of to jointly improve the company s products  production processes and automation 
the company agreed to pay corning for such services by issuing warrants to purchase common stock at agreed upon values and exercise prices 
the company is designing products primarily for new products in emerging markets 
development work for new battery designs and the integration of such designs into a complete battery pack for new products in emerging markets has taken longer than anticipated for a number of reasons 
in some circumstances  the company has experienced changing requirements for the new products for which it is designing battery packs 
these new products are being tested with new battery packs and other newly designed components simultaneously 
such changing requirements have contributed to the delays in completion of the programs 
in other circumstances  the company underestimated the amount of time and effort required to customize a battery to meet the unique size  weight  and performance characteristics required for different applications given the company s limited resources 
the company did not have the organizational structure or funding required for numerous simultaneous research and development programs for new products in emerging markets 
management of the company is attempting to develop the organizational structure and funding required for such programs 
additionally  in order to successfully commercialize the individual battery types  it was necessary for the company to focus attention on the unique charging and performance management issues associated with each particular battery pack and application 
for instance  in portable power tool applications  the customer stipulated that the battery meet certain performance characteristics with a certain type of charger which is very different than the type of charger historically used by the company to charge its batteries 
in ev and hev applications  certain customers stipulated that the company provide a battery management system to monitor and optimize the performance of a string of batteries in a pack 
these projects required existing and newly hired electrical engineers and programmers of the company to focus on designing and building electrical components and developing related software for each application with unique battery  packaging and performance characteristics 
the company either did not anticipate that these problems would need to be solved internally or underestimated the difficulty of these projects at the time these markets were entered given the company s limited resources 
in most cases  it was assumed that these customers would develop or outsource their unique chargers and battery management systems since these systems have historically not been in the company s area of expertise 
the successful design of a battery pack for each application which includes unique charging and battery management systems has been one of the most difficult problems of the company to overcome in successfully commercializing the numerous individual batteries currently under development 
additionally  government certification of the aircraft and helicopter starting batteries has taken longer than expected due to the stringent vibration and other testing required to meet federal aviation administration faa requirements necessary for certification  which were never previously encountered by the company 
sales of existing battery types did not increase as expected in late primarily due to delays in orders from chrysler and lockheed martin for batteries to be used in emerging markets 
chrysler had indicated in the third quarter of that it would order batteries from the company in order to meet government mandates for zero emission vehicles zev in the states of new york and massachusetts 
in december of  chrysler announced its decision to use nickel metal hydride batteries in zevs for the model year 
chrysler did however place a million order with the company in early for existing vehicles 
lockheed martin has indicated that purchases of batteries have been less than anticipated because of problems with other suppliers of parts for their hevs which has delayed production of such vehicles 
as a result of the delays in development work and sales of batteries and its inability to successfully complete a larger debt or equity financing  in february  the company cut its staffing by approximately to reduce costs 
management anticipates that such cost cuts will allow the company additional time to explore strategic alternatives such as a business combination  the sale of assets and or a strategic alliance and to attempt to increase revenues and further reduce costs 
the company is in preliminary discussions regarding possible transactions  but there can be no assurance of completion 
if additional financing  a business combination  sale of assets or a strategic alliance cannot be arranged by may   the company plans further significant reductions in the work force and possible subsequent elimination or relocation of manufacturing and other functions with the primary goal of maintaining research and development capabilities  the corporate legal entity and protection of the core technology 
such plans would require additional capital 
these alternative plans are subject to a great deal of risk and uncertainty 
there is no assurance that any of these alternate plans will be successful or that the company will be able to continue as a going concern 
revenue the company generated project revenue of approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  approximately  of revenue was generated from smh  darpa and fiat for the development and or evaluation of batteries and battery packs for hev and ev applications and  was generated from chrysler for various engineering  environmental and other tests performed on the battery 
management expects project revenue to decrease in as project agreements with these customers to design and build prototype batteries and battery packs are expected to be complete in mid and late at which time orders for prototype batteries from such customers are expected to commence  however  the timing and amount of such revenue is uncertain 
approximately  in project revenue in was generated from chrysler for environmental and other tests performed on the horizon battery and  was generated in for the retrofit of the horizon battery for their epic minivan program 
the remainder of project revenue generated in was from darpa  fiat  black decker and others which remain confidential for the development of prototype batteries for ev  hev and portable power tool applications 
project revenue of  generated during was from a program to perform a preliminary design review pdr for a potential manufacturing facility in india 
this review was concluded in and work under this program was terminated 
the company had battery sales of approximately   and  for the years ending december   and  respectively 
approximately of the company s battery sales and of and battery sales were to chrysler 
these purchases were for testing and evaluation of the horizon battery in the epic minivan program  as chrysler has not yet offered the electric minivan for lease or sale to the general public 
chrysler announced its decision to use nickel metal hydride batteries in its electric minivan for the model year  however  it has continued to order small amounts of batteries from the company for further testing and evaluation 
approximately of battery sales were to lockheed martin for use in hevs and evs which they are producing for fleet consumers 
the remainder of battery sales in all years were from numerous customers requesting batteries for testing and evaluation 
management expects the level of battery sales to remain flat or slightly increase in late as the company fills a portion or all of its million purchase order from chrysler 
releases under a purchase order from lockheed martin are expected to increase in late  and orders from others testing production or prototype batteries may begin 
additionally  management expects to receive faa certification of its battery designs used in the aircraft and helicopter starting applications in late at which time sales of these batteries are expected to commence 
however  the amount and timing of any of these sales remains uncertain 
the majority of these applications are in emerging markets and the entry of final products into such markets is difficult to predict 
moreover  if a business combination  sale of assets  a strategic alliance or additional financing cannot be arranged by may   the company plans further personnel reductions and possible subsequent elimination or relocation of manufacturing and other operations 
additionally  on april   the company expects to be required to give notice to cancel its facility lease effective september  management is discussing the terms of a new lease to be effective after september  with the lessor of the facility with essentially the same terms as the existing lease with the exclusion of bdm as guarantor and the requirement for a  security deposit 
if the company is unable to renegotiate or replace its lease of the facility before september   the cost of moving and reinstalling production and pollution control equipment to a new location would be significant and would prohibit or greatly impair the company s ability to produce batteries for an indefinite period of time  and conduct its operations 
see also liquidity and capital resources below 
in july  the company received a  payment from chrysler 
chrysler designated  of this payment as compensation for continued capacity maintenance and ramp up costs incurred by the company in relation to its role as a supplier to the automaker for its epic minivan program and  for various engineering  research and development er d efforts 
during  the company recorded  as income as all tasks necessary to earn the income were performed and there were no further obligations related to such revenue 
the company recorded  as deferred revenue which was recognized as income in as the er d tasks were performed 
the company also generated  in in license fees under a distribution agreement with mitsui engineering shipbuilding co  ltd 
mes for the export and exclusive distribution of the company s horizon battery in japan 
in  the company completed a termination agreement with mes which terminated the distribution agreement and settled all outstanding financial matters with mes 
costs and expenses total costs and expenses decreased by approximately  or during  however the composition of the costs incurred during was different than in manufacturing costs decreased by approximately  or during while battery sales increased by 
the decrease in such costs was due to increases in productivity and further refinement of the production processes 
manufacturing costs have remained high as a percentage of battery sales primarily due to the fact that the company has not had the capital required to further automate the production processes  materials are being purchased in low volumes and the fixed facility costs of leasing and maintaining its  square foot facility are significant 
management expects that manufacturing costs can decrease as a percentage of battery sales if  and when  volume production begins  however  additional capital will be required for manufacturing tooling required for the production of prototype battery models in order to achieve manufacturing efficiencies and to lower raw material costs 
the timing and amount of battery orders remains uncertain and the sources of capital which would be required for the related tooling for such orders may not be available to the company 
selling  general and administrative costs decreased by approximately  or during primarily due to cost savings associated the consolidation of the company s corporate and manufacturing facilities into one location in late  combined with cost cutting efforts 
the company subleased the austin facility  reducing related lease and utility costs by approximately  annually 
costs were also reduced significantly for travel  legal  accounting and consulting fees 
management expects selling  general and administrative costs to continue to decrease in based on the actions taken in february to further reduce the work force and control costs 
research and development costs increased by approximately  or in due to the significant increase in development work associated with the custom design of numerous batteries and battery packs for customers smh  fiat  smud  black decker  chrysler and another which remains confidential  testing and evaluation of batteries aircraft and helicopter starting applications and costs associated with joint research and development efforts with corning to improve the company s products  production processes and automation 
the costs associated with such development efforts have been significant 
it is anticipated that the current level of research and development expenditures will remain relatively constant during as the work on most of these and other programs is expected to continue for most of the year 
technology license and royalty costs and depreciation and amortization costs were comparable from to and are expected to remain relatively constant during interest costs slightly decreased during and are expected to increase in as the company s debt obligations have increased during and early the company has issued convertible notes payable to corning with a principal balance of  as of february  at face interest rates of 
the company is also amortizing discounts on the convertible notes payable and expects interest expense related to this amortization of approximately  in total costs and expenses decreased significantly during the year ended december  compared to since sales did not materialize as anticipated in late and into  management began a cost reduction program during staffing was reduced by approximately during during late  management made the decision to consolidate its austin headquarters into the san marcos manufacturing plant to further reduce costs 
costs were also reduced as a result of increases in productivity 
generally  total costs were higher in as compared to  as the company began to purchase machinery and implement production processes to manufacture the horizon battery in commercial quantities and increased the production  marketing and administrative staffs accordingly in anticipation of the production purchase order received from chrysler in december during  the company also incurred significant nonrecurring costs to replace batteries which failed to perform as expected due to early manufacturing problems as well as improper storage and charging of the batteries by customers 
additionally  the company issued  shares of unregistered  restricted shares of common stock in which were valued at  and charged to expense  associated with investor public relations services to be provided by a consulting firm 
significant research and development expenditures were also incurred in which resulted in technical achievements in specific energy  power and cycle life from batteries produced on the manufacturing line  not just laboratory prototypes 
interest costs were higher in as well due to the incurrance in of approximately  in convertible debt financing which generally converted within days of the respective financing 
interest costs in included  related to the conversion discount from market on the convertible notes payable generally 
the discount was amortized over the period beginning with the issuance of the debt to the first date that conversion could occur generally days 
interest costs of  were recorded in for the convertible notes payable issued in there were no convertible notes payable issued in as a part of the battery manufacturing process  the company handles and disposes of various hazardous materials such as lead and sulfuric acid 
the company is subject to strict environmental regulations and has incurred significant costs in installing equipment to manage and control hazardous substances and pollution 
the company expended   and  in  and  respectively  in capital expenditures for such equipment 
as part of its on going operations  the company incurred   and  in non capital expenditures in  and  respectively  to properly dispose of hazardous materials and waste 
as a result of such preventive measures  the company has not incurred significant remediation costs 
however  on march   the company received two letters of violation from the city of san marcos  one relative to its lead discharges in wastewater from july through december which were in excess of the limits established in the national categorical pretreatment standards ncps set by the environmental protection agency epa and one relative to its zinc discharges in wastewater beginning in december which were in excess of the allowable concentration limits of the company s permit for zinc regulated by the city of san marcos 
the city of san marcos has indicated that no fines or penalties will be assessed for these operational violations 
the ncps compliance calculations for this facility are based on a ratio consisting of the product of total lead contained in daily wastewater discharge flows and total daily wastewater discharge flows divided by daily lead usage 
the absolute amount of lead contained in the daily wastewater discharged by the facility is well below its allowable limits 
the company has consistently operated at treatment levels approximately below the maximum allowable local limits of lead emissions 
the ncps calculations were established for traditional lead acid battery manufacturers which use a much larger amount of lead in the battery manufacturing process than the company and operate at higher volumes 
the company is operating at relatively low production levels 
due to the company s relatively low lead usage in the battery manufacturing process and its low production volume  the calculated concentration limits in the ratio are difficult for the company to achieve 
the company can improve its ncps compliance calculation ratio by decreasing the amount of lead contained in its daily wastewater discharge flow or decreasing the amount of daily wastewater discharged 
the company has developed a plan that it believes will enable it to become compliant with the ncps standards which involve the recycling and reuse of water within the facility  construction of roofing over the exterior air scrubber to divert the collection of rain water in order to reduce the volume of water collected and treated and other actions 
the company estimates that the cost of such actions will be approximately  there can be no assurance that such actions will allow the company to become compliant with the ncps standards 
if these actions do not allow the company to operate within the ncps standards  it will be necessary for the company to prepare a request for variance from the ncps standards  which would be time consuming and costly 
the company does not use zinc in its manufacturing process 
the company believes that the zinc concentrations were caused by corrosion of metal brackets in the company s trenching which houses its plumbing and wastewater piping 
the company believes that the repairs to this trenching which will allow it to become compliant with its permit for zinc emissions will cost approximately  there can be no assurance that the estimated repairs to the trenching will be sufficient to allow the company to become compliant with the allowable zinc concentration limits in its permit 
other than the costs associated with these two operational violations  management is not currently aware of any infrequent or non recurring clean up expenditures to be incurred in the future based on present circumstances and conditions 
the company has completed an assessment of its information technology systems readiness for the year and currently believes that the modifications necessary for the year are not significant 
this is because the company s information systems are not complex and have been purchased installed over the last few years and the company believes most of the related software is year compliant or year compliant replacements are readily available 
the company also believes embedded software in its manufacturing production equipment is either not year sensitive or was developed considering the impact of the year issues 
the company will be testing its systems for year readiness in and the project is estimated to be complete in late  prior to any estimated impact 
the company does not expect the costs of this project to be material or for it to have a significant effect on operations and believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems 
however  if management s assessment proves inaccurate or if such modifications and conversions are not made or are not completed timely  the year issue might impact the operations of the company 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes and similar uncertainties 
during the years ended december   and  the company issued approximately   and  shares of common stock  respectively  as a result of financing transactions  purchases of technology and equipment  payment of the technology license payable and consulting services and the exercise of stock options 
as a result of the increase in shares for these years  the loss per share in each was less than it would have been based on the shares outstanding at the end of the preceding year 
management of the company believes that the issuance of shares in these years was necessary to fund the increased working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
liquidity and capital resources during  the company did not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund its working capital needs 
as a result  the company sold  shares of common stock combined with  warrants to purchase common stock at prices ranging from to per share which resulted in net proceeds to the company of  during the year 
additionally  in order to reduce monthly cash expenditures for operating and capital leases and to obtain release of restricted cash securing letters of credit securing capital leases  the company issued  shares of common stock to settle or prepay such obligations 
the company issued  shares of common stock to a lessor in settlement of  of lease obligations and for the purchase of  of capital equipment at which time letters of credit for  which collateralized the lease obligations were canceled and certificates of deposit of an equal amount that collateralized the letters of credit were released 
the company issued  shares of common stock to bdm technologies  inc now a division of trw  inc bdm toward past due obligations owed and prepayment under operating leases for certain production equipment 
during  the company borrowed  in the form of convertible notes from corning 
in january and february  the company borrowed an additional  of convertible notes from corning 
funds generated in from these activities were used to maintain minimum production capabilities and to sustain operations  to design and develop custom batteries and battery packs for several applications and to pay for the lease and maintenance of its  square foot manufacturing facility 
capital expenditures of approximately  were incurred in  primarily related to further automation 
development work has taken longer than anticipated and battery sales have been delayed 
cash flow is not sufficient to fund operations 
therefore  in february  the company reduced its staffing by approximately to reduce costs 
management anticipates that such reductions in cost will allow the company additional time to explore strategic alternatives such as a business combination  the sale of assets and or a strategic alliance and to attempt to increase revenues and further reduce costs 
the company is in preliminary discussions regarding possible transactions  but there is no assurance that such transactions can be completed and if completed can generate the funds required to sustain the company 
management believes that it has sufficient cash on hand and to be received from firm orders for batteries and development work to continue operations at current levels through may of if a business combination  sale of assets  strategic alliance or additional financing cannot be arranged by may  it will be necessary to make further reductions in the work force  primarily at the executive management level  which management believes could allow the company to operate into august of if a significant order for batteries is not completed or a business combination  sale of assets  strategic alliance or additional financing cannot be arranged by the end of the second quarter of  it will be necessary for the company to make significant reductions in the work force  and eliminate or relocate manufacturing and or other functions with the primary goal of maintaining research and development capabilities  the corporate legal entity and protection of the core technology 
such plans would also require the company to obtain additional capital 
these alternate plans are subject to a great deal of uncertainty and risk 
there is no assurance that such plans will be successful or that the company will be able to continue as a going concern 
the company s  monthly obligation for the lease of the manufacturing facility is currently guaranteed by bdm 
the company has agreed to purchase the facility or otherwise remove bdm as guarantor of the lease by no later than april   in the event the company does not purchase the facility or remove bdm as guarantor by this date  then the company is required to give notice to cancel the facility lease effective september  management of the company expects that it will be required on april  to give notice to cancel its facility lease effective september  management is discussing the terms of a new lease to be effective after september  with the lessor of the facility with essentially the same terms as the existing lease with the exclusion of bdm as guarantor and the requirement for a  security deposit 
however  there is no assurance that a satisfactory arrangement can be reached with the lessor 
if the company terminates the facility lease  the cost of moving and reinstalling production and pollution control equipment to a new location  which has not yet been selected  would be significant and would prohibit or greatly impair the company s ability to produce batteries for an indefinite period of time  and hence impair the conduct of the company s operations 
in december  the company issued  shares of common stock to bdm as partial payment for past obligations owed to bdm for occupancy related costs which the company has accrued and as prepayment under operating leases for manufacturing equipment which are guaranteed by bdm 
the number of shares issued was determined based on the fair market value of the shares at the date of the agreement per share 
when the shares are sold by bdm  the proceeds will be used to satisfy these past and future obligations 
if the proceeds from the sale of such shares are not sufficient to satisfy the obligations  the company will issue additional shares of common stock or pay cash to bdm to make up the deficiency 
bdm has agreed to accept a minimum of per share or  for the shares issued 
bdm will retain any overage from the sale of such shares in excess of the amounts owed 
the company has agreed to pay  to bdm for the remaining unpaid occupancy related costs from the proceeds received from any fundraising activities completed by the company before march  in excess of  the company s closing market price as reported by nasdaq on march  was 
bdm has not notified the company of an intent to sell such shares in the near term  however  unless the value of the company s common stock improves  based on current market prices of the company s common stock  additional shares of common stock or cash will be required to settle these obligations under the terms of this agreement 
significant capital expenditures will be required in the future to further automate and achieve consistency in the production process  however  such expenditures are not expected to be significant in to satisfy current battery orders 
there were no significant capital commitments at december  convertible notes payable of  issued by corning in late and early will mature on december  the debentures are convertible into convertible preferred stock or common stock 
debentures with a principal balance at  are convertible into  shares of the company s cumulative convertible preferred stock  which is then convertible into common stock at per share 
the debentures are convertible directly into common stock at per share 
the company s common stock is traded in the over the counter market and is reported on the nasdaq stock marketsm nasdaq 
in order to maintain listing by nasdaq under new rules which went into effect in february  the company must maintain a minimum million of net tangible assets total assets  excluding goodwill  minus total liabilities 
the company is not in compliance with this new requirement as of december  and does not expect to be in compliance without the infusion of additional equity financing  the sale of assets  forgiveness or conversion of debt or a business combination 
the company is in preliminary discussions regarding possible arrangements  although there is no assurance that such a transaction can be completed or if completed will generate the net tangible assets required by the new requirement 
additionally  nasdaq requires a minimum per share minimum bid price to maintain listing 
the company s closing market price as reported on nasdaq on march  was 
the company expects to be notified by nasdaq of its noncompliance with listing requirements 
ordinarily  before delisting  nasdaq would provide the company notice and an opportunity to present and carry out a plan for compliance with the listing requirements 
in the event that the common stock were no longer traded on the nasdaq market  brokers and dealers effecting trades in the common stock would become subject to the securities and exchange commission rules covering trading in penny stocks 
these rules generally require that such broker dealers make specified disclosures to customers including information on available bid and asked prices for the stock in question and compensation to the broker dealer and his associates with respect to the proposed trade  and provide periodic reports as to the market value of a customer s position in penny stocks 
the rules also impose heightened know your customer requirements that require broker dealers to obtain information  including personal financial information  from customers sufficient to allow the broker dealer to make a determination that investment in penny stocks is suitable for the customer and that the customer is capable of assessing the risks of such an investment 
broker dealers may be less willing to effect trades in any security subject to these rules due to the additional disclosure  record keeping and other requirements imposed by the rules 
in addition  some potential investors in penny stocks may be reluctant to provide the required personal financial information to broker dealers  which may reduce the number of potential investors 
these factors would likely further reduce trading liquidity in the common stock 
if the company is delisted from nasdaq and is unable to obtain significant additional orders for batteries or additional development contracts  it will be difficult to obtain additional funding 
there can be no assurance that additional funding  contracts or sales which will generate sufficient cash to sustain operations can be obtained on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the company to continue as a going concern 
other in  the company signed a know how license agreement the agreement with horizon battery technologies  ltd 
hbtl  of bombay  india  calling for the completion of several detailed subordinate agreements with the ultimate purpose to license the manufacture and sale of batteries in india 
the effectiveness of the agreement was conditioned upon the subsequent execution of these six related agreements  none of which were executed 
the company believes  therefore  the agreement never became effective and has no force or effect 
separately in  hbtl agreed to pay the company  for a preliminary design review pdr for a potential manufacturing facility in india which was required to complete one of the subordinate agreements 
the company received  from hbtl and completed the pdr in the remaining  was never paid by hbtl  in spite of repeated demands by the company 
in september  the company received a demand from hbtl to arbitrate damage claims for alleged breach of the agreement 
hbtl claimed damages of approximately million for its expenses and lost profits related to the agreement 
the company disputes the claim for damages and will vigorously defend any action taken by hbtl to pursue the claims 
the company also filed a petition in state court in travis county  texas  seeking  among other things  a declaratory judgment that hbtl had no right to arbitration or monetary relief 
hbtl contested jurisdiction and removed the proceedings to the us federal courts 
the federal district court to which the action was removed ruled that it did not have personal jurisdiction over hbtl and therefore had no power to hear the case 
the company filed an appeal in the us fifth circuit court of appeals from the final judgment and rulings in the district court 
a decision on the appeal is expected in three to six months 
no liability has been recorded in the financial statements at december  for this uncertainty as management is unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of this matter or to estimate the amount or range of potential loss should the outcome be unfavorable 
the resolution of this matter could have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company 
management of the company believes that inflation does not have a material effect on the company s results of operations
