the company reported a net loss of million  after re engineering expense  compared to net income of million in the loss per share was for compared to diluted net income per share of in excluding re engineering expenses and merger costs  the company earned million or per share in all financial data has been restated to reflect the acquisition of sentient systems  inc  which has been accounted for as a pooling of interests 
in the fourth quarter of  the company completed its multi year  company wide re engineering program and also concluded its merger with sentient systems  inc  now renamed dynavox systems dynavox 
approximately million in re engineering expenses and merger costs were incurred during to complete these activities 
the re engineering expenses were principally related to the implementation of computer system conversions  the relocation of production activities and personnel and the disposition of facilities and equipment 
in addition  the company realigned certain divisions at year end into three distribution channel focused operating groups the home healthcare group hhg  the global continuing care group ccg and european homecare 
the primary impact is that all product lines sold through dealers or distributors in the us will be handled by hhg  while ccg will assume responsibility for representing all sunrise products sold directly to nursing homes and other healthcare institutions in the us and internationally 
this re alignment has been reflected in the following tables and the related discussion of sales and expenses

internal growth of from to was primarily the result of unit sales increases 
average selling prices in a number of major product lines declined in  primarily due to healthcare cost containment pressures 
healthcare cost reduction continues to be pursued in the united states and europe  causing downward pressure on the company s prices 
management believes that it is appropriately reducing its cost structure through a strategic re alignment and by consolidating business units  factories and salesforces 
a summary of sales by business group as a percentage of total net sales follows analysis of product line sales contribution in millions home healthcare group continuing care group dynavox european homecare comfort clinic total divested in october net sales of the home healthcare group hhg reached record levels in each of the last three years  growing to million in  after an increase of to million in from sales of million in strong sales of mobility products led the increase in  while respiratory and personal care products advanced only modestly 
respiratory sales were negatively impacted by the balanced budget act of  which reduced reimbursement for oxygen concentrator rentals beginning january   causing respiratory dealers to delay their purchases of equipment for their rental fleets 
growth in custom wheelchair sales was attributed primarily to strong sales of standard lightweight manual wheelchairs 
sales of respiratory products led the increase in  followed by custom wheelchairs and personal care products 
average selling prices decreased primarily as a result of the increase in discounts to large national accounts and to a change in the product mix to lower priced products 
continuing care group ccg sales decreased in to million 
this followed a decline of in to million 
although unit volume increased in sales of beds  patient room furniture and bathing systems  these were partially offset by a decline in unit sales of accessories 
generally  in  average selling prices declined as a result of a change in mix to lower priced products  while the decrease in unit sales of accessories was attributed to customers purchasing fewer of them with their new bed orders 
the decline in sales in was attributed to the decline of average selling prices as a result of growth in large national contracts  while the decrease in unit sales of patient furniture was attributed to the shift in new construction funding from nursing homes to assisted living centers 
unit volume sales of bathing systems also declined in  primarily due to the discontinuation of several products 
in order to address the decline in sales at ccg  the company has taken a number of steps  including implementing management changes  introducing new products and aggressively seeking new business such as a supply contract  won from a competitor  to serve all public healthcare institutions in paris  france 
the acquisition of dynavox contributed million to net sales in  an increase of from sales grew to million in the increases each year were primarily the result of the introduction of new products 
dynavox introduced eight new products in the fourth quarter of that led to a build up in backlog at year end 
sales in europe decreased by in to million following an increase of in to million from million in in  overall european unit sales volumes were up on relatively flat prices  partially offset by a shift in product mix to lower priced products

overall  during  european unit sales volumes increased from their levels  while average selling prices were lower than prior years in several markets due to increasing discounts to dealers 
product sales growth was led by custom wheelchairs  which remained the largest european product line and demonstrated modest volume increases 
personal care products and beds also contributed to the total growth in sales in  while respiratory sales declined  primarily due to the termination of a distribution agreement sunrise had with another manufacturer 
expense and profit analysis in  gross margin gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to and 
to in gross margin in a number of domestic product lines was adversely affected by market pricing pressures and product mix shifts indirectly driven by the growth of managed healthcare and consolidation of the company s customer base

the following is a summary of expenses and profits as a percentage of net sales increase decrease in millions net sales gross profit of net sales marketing  selling and administrative expenses of net sales research and development expenses of net sales amortization of goodwill and other intangibles of net sales re engineering expenses  merger costs and unusual items of net sales corporate operating loss income of net sales interest expense of net sales interest income and other  net of net sales loss income before income taxes of net sales income tax expense benefit of loss income before taxes net loss income of net sales percentage not meaningful in january  the company announced the consolidation of its five us homecare divisions into the home healthcare group based in longmont  colorado  and also initiated a series of consolidations of european operations 
these actions were designed to improve manufacturing and marketing efficiencies while reducing operating costs 
pre tax charges of million were incurred in in connection with these consolidations 
approximately million in non recurring costs were incurred during to complete these activities 
in addition  the company merged with dynavox in april merger related expenses incurred were approximately million 
of the total charges of million incurred in  approximately million required cash payments and million represented non cash charges 
in  after an intensive review of the company s businesses  settlement of stockholder litigation related to the announcement of the investigation of accounting practices in its support surfaces business  subsequent restatement of the company s and financial statements  and the initiation of a major plan of reorganization  the company recorded pre tax charges from unusual items of million 
these charges included million for costs of the internal investigation  restatement  and reissuance of historical financial statements and the settlement of related litigation  including attorneys fees  million for the write down of assets at bio clinic and comfort clinic to reflect revised estimates of net asset realizations  including goodwill  and million related to the company s reorganization and cost reduction program including severance costs of million 
of the total charges of million  approximately million required cash payments and million represented non cash charges

corporate operating income excluding re engineering expenses  merger costs and unusual items decreased to of sales in  compared to in  primarily due to the decline in the gross margin to from in the improvement to in was primarily due to the decrease in marketing  selling and administrative expenses and the improvement in the support surfaces business 
interest expense increased by in to million following a decrease of to million in higher interest rates caused by less favorable terms in the company s credit agreement and higher interest rates for the new senior notes  which fixed interest rates for seven to years  contributed to the increase in interest expense in the reduction resulted from lower average borrowings during  as well as lower average interest rates 
interest income increased in to million after an increase of in  reflecting the growth in installment receivables in and interest resulting from an income tax refund 
management believes that the wide range of installment financing plans offered by its sunmed finance subsidiary is an important contributor to its market position in the us home healthcare market 
other income expense  net increased to million in from 
million in primarily as a result of the receipt of a legal settlement payment of million and approximately 
million from the sale of a facility 
in  the company s tax expense was  compared to tax expense of million in and a tax benefit of million in the effective tax rates of  and differ from the us corporate tax rate of primarily because of non deductible goodwill amortization 
in addition to the goodwill impact  the effective tax rate of in on a loss of million was also driven by tax expense recorded on pre tax income in certain foreign jurisdictions with high tax rates 
the net loss in was million or of net sales compared to net income in of million 
excluding the after tax impact of re engineering expenses and costs associated with the dynavox merger in  net income was million or of net sales 
in  as a result of the unusual item charges  the company incurred a net loss of million 
the company attempts to minimize or offset the impact of inflationary pressures on labor and raw material costs through increased sales volume  improved productivity  active cost control measures  and  to a lesser extent  increases in product pricing 
the company believes that inflationary material cost increases may continue and that the markets in which it sells its products will remain price sensitive  thereby limiting its ability to offset higher costs with pricing actions 
financial position  capital resources and liquidity cash flow primarily as a result of re engineering expenditures  cash flows provided by operations decreased to million in from million in cash flows provided by operations were million in cash generation defined as net income plus non cash charges has historically been an important source of funding for capital spending  working capital and acquisitions 
cash generation was million in  reflecting the impact of re engineering expenses and merger costs 
this compares to million of net income in and million in the company also evaluates the results of operations of the business using ebitda  defined by the company as earnings loss before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
excluding re engineering expenses  merger costs and unusual items  ebitda was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
as noted above  the unusual item charges in included million requiring the payment of cash  of which million was paid in  million in and million in management estimates that the remaining liability of million will be paid out in of the total charges of million incurred in approximately million was paid in cash  and the remaining million is expected to be paid in capital expenditures capital spending in was million  approximately equal to depreciation expense  compared to million  in  or of depreciation expense and million in  which was approximately equal to depreciation expense 
significant investments made in include leasehold improvements  enhancements in machinery and equipment and new product tooling  and computer hardware and software for the conversions taking place throughout the company 
the company expects capital expenditures in to be higher than in acquisitions on april   the company exchanged approximately million shares of common stock valued at approximately million for all of the outstanding common stock of sentient systems technology  inc  now named dynavox systems  a manufacturer of augmentative communication devices and software for persons affected by speech disabilities 
the transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
on november   the company completed the acquisition of mechanical application designs  inc madi  a manufacturer of tilt recline seating systems  for approximately  shares valued at million and cash of 
million 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase 
pro forma results of operations giving effect to the acquisition as though it had occurred on june  would not differ materially from amounts reported 
on december   the company acquired kid kart  inc  a manufacturer of pediatric positioning strollers and other dependent mobility products  for  shares of common stock valued at million and cash of 
million 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase 
pro forma results of operations giving effect to the acquisition as though it had occurred on july  would not differ materially from amounts reported 
capital structure and leverage the company s capital structure consists of two primary components stockholders equity and long term debt 
stockholders equity was million at the end of  a decrease of million from the prior year end primarily from the net loss of million incurred during the year 
analysis of long term debt fixed rate debt as a percentage of total debt at year end foreign denominated debt as a percentage of total debt at year end weighted average annual interest rate interest coverage before unusual items x x x long term debt  excluding current installments  of million at july   was approximately equal to long term debt at june  the ratio of debt to total capitalization increased to at year end  compared to at the end of sunrise attempts to minimize interest expense while also managing exposure to variable interest rates by employing interest rate exchange agreements  or swaps  to convert its bank borrowings from floating rate into the equivalent of fixed rate debt 
however  as a policy sunrise does not use interest rate swaps or any other derivatives that have a level of complexity or risk which  in the judgment of sunrise s management  is higher than the exposure to be hedged 
the company does not hold or issue such instruments for trading purposes 
sunrise has used foreign denominated borrowings from its multi currency credit facility to hedge against foreign currency balance sheet exposures that would otherwise result from changes in currency values 
total foreign denominated debt at year end was million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
on october   the company completed a private placement of million of senior notes  million maturing after seven years and bearing interest at  with the remaining million maturing after years at an interest rate of 
the proceeds of this debt issuance were used to reduce the outstanding debt on the company s unsecured multi currency credit facility 
the company s multi currency credit facility  amended as of july   provides for maximum borrowings of million  declining to million in january  and maturing in january the company must comply with certain covenants  such as the maintenance of leverage ratio and interest coverage  minimum levels of tangible net worth  and certain restrictions on acquisitions 
as of july  the company had approximately million of funds available from the credit facility 
foreign currency risk management operating on a global basis requires a posture of active currency risk management 
to finance imports and exports  the company utilizes a variety of foreign currencies that are constantly shifting in relative value 
the company engages in hedging activities to reduce potential transaction losses on net cash flows and balances denominated in these currencies 
these amounts can arise from cross border trade flows or intercompany financing transactions 
the company s financial statements are also affected by foreign currency translation fluctuations 
these distort the comparative results of foreign operations when they are translated into us dollars using dissimilar rates 
in contrast to transaction gains or losses  translation adjustments are not the result of a cash exchange of currencies and  therefore  do not give rise to a direct economic gain or loss 
in these cases the costs to execute hedges would exceed any consistently realizable tangible benefits 
consequently  sunrise does not commit economic resources to hedge against the potential effect of foreign currency translation fluctuations 
it believes that the best long term protection of stockholder value is to do business in a broad number of currencies 
dividend policy while provisions of the company s credit facility and senior notes restrict the payment of dividends  the company s present policy is to use available cash flow for reinvestment in its core businesses  for future acquisitions and for debt reduction rather than to pay a cash dividend 
this policy reflects an appraisal by management and the board of directors  which includes the company s largest stockholder  of the attractiveness of the company s investment opportunities and their confidence in its ability to increase economic value for its stockholders through cash retention and reinvestment 
this policy is reviewed periodically as industry conditions change 
provisions of the company s credit facility and senior notes currently restricts the payment of dividends 
year compliance many currently installed computer systems and software products in use around the world today are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
this could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
as a result  many companies software and computer systems may need to be upgraded or replaced in order to comply with such year requirements 
a corporate oversight task force is in operation at sunrise to address year issues 
milestones have been established and detailed plans are actively being implemented so that sunrise research programs  products and internal computer  financial  manufacturing and other infrastructure systems are reviewed  and the necessary changes are addressed 
corporate and divisional staff  including the company s internal auditors  are performing independent reviews and evaluations of equipment and systems to verify compliance 
additionally  sunrise customer and supplier relationships are being reviewed to assess and address year issues 
the company has undertaken internal reviews to assess year issues related to sunrise products 
during  all sunrise information processing operations in the us were consolidated onto two system platforms from original legacy systems 
in europe  the conversion of sunrise operations to a common year compliant system is complete in the uk and france  with the conversions for germany  spain and the outlying distribution companies scheduled to be completed by mid calendar due to the mechanical nature and the absence of date dependent functions in most products manufactured and sold by sunrise  year compliance is virtually assured 
those products with date functions will be analyzed and tested by the company s engineering and quality assurance staff by mid calendar to determine whether they will be in any way affected by the year situation 
while the company is taking numerous steps to ensure that all products are year compliant and to make information on the year readiness of sunrise products available to its customers  there is no way to fully guarantee that the company will be completely successful in either case 
also  sunrise is requesting assurances from its major suppliers that they are addressing this issue and that products procured by sunrise will function properly in the year year compliance is a requisite for achieving and maintaining approved supplier status 
certain critical suppliers have been unwilling to provide such assurances and do not expect to provide such assurances prior to the year other critical suppliers do not expect to be able to provide such assurances until in both instances  this is particularly the case outside of the united states where sunrise has significant operations 
this could result in manufacturing delays and backlogs 
in addition  many governmental agencies including agencies which directly or indirectly provide funding for the purchase of products sold by sunrise and other third parties such as telephone  electricity and other utility companies may not be year compliant 
as a result  it is difficult for the company to assess the likelihood  or the impact on its business  of such entities failure to be year compliant 
the company anticipates that its systems  equipment and processes will be substantially year compliant by the end of june although a budget has been established  the cost to the company of achieving year compliance is evolving  however  it is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company currently expects that the year issue will not pose significant operational problems 
however  delays in the company s remediation efforts  or a failure to timely identify all year dependencies in the systems  equipment or processes of the company  its vendors  customers  financial institutions or other third parties could have material adverse consequences  including delays in the manufacture  delivery or sale of products 
the company is in the process of developing contingency plans along with its remediation efforts for continuing operations in the event such problems arise  but no assurances can be given that the company will be fully successful in this regard 
recent accounting developments the company intends to adopt statement of financial accounting standards no 
 reporting comprehensive income sfas  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas  in both standards will require additional disclosure  but will not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
sfas establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and is expected to first be reflected in the company s first quarter of interim financial statements 
components of comprehensive income include items such as net earnings  foreign currency translation adjustments and changes in value of available for sale securities 
sfas changes the way companies report segment information and requires segments to be determined and reported based on how management measures performance and makes decisions about allocating resources 
sfas will first be reflected in the company s annual report 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the statement is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  earlier application of the statement is permitted 
adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
factors that may affect future operating results the company has made forward looking statements in this report  including the estimated benefits to be realized from the consolidation of various sunrise divisions worldwide  timing of the completion of the conversion of european computer systems and the level of future capital expenditures 
these statements are only predictions 
actual events or results may differ materially as a result of risks and uncertainties facing the company including competition the company encounters significant competition domestically from a number of well established manufacturers in each of its product lines  and from foreign sources for some products 
in certain countries and product markets  including the united states  the company may face competition from other manufacturers that have larger market shares or other competitive advantages 
pricing pressures the growth in national chains and buying groups among home medical equipment providers has caused manufacturers  including the company  to reduce their effective prices by offering increased volume discounts 
the increasing penetration of managed care into the home medical equipment industry is exacerbating this trend 
if the company is unable to achieve sufficient manufacturing and technological efficiencies to offset any future price reductions  its profit margins will be adversely affected 
re engineering program the company has completed its three year corporate re engineering program that has consolidated its domestic and european divisions and its us salesforces 
in  the company invested approximately million in this program  including the costs of new and upgraded management information systems necessary to support the newly consolidated operations 
these investments are expected to result in future cost reductions and operating efficiencies 
however  there is no assurance that the anticipated re engineering savings and efficiencies will in fact be achieved 
raw material costs historically  prices paid for certain raw materials  such as aluminum  steel and foam  have fluctuated 
when prices have increased  the company has not always been able to pass along the full effect of such increases to its customers in order to maintain or enhance its market position 
new products the company s future results will depend in part on its ability to enhance existing products and to introduce new products on a timely and cost effective basis that meet evolving customer requirements 
delays in introduction or a disappointing market acceptance could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
medicare medicaid funding the us healthcare industry is heavily reliant upon extensive government regulation and funding at the federal and state levels 
the company is a provider under medicaid through our dynavox division 
the company is not a provider under medicare or medicaid for its homecare or extended care products 
however  such products are sold to home medical equipment hme providers  nursing homes and hospitals that are providers under these programs and do depend upon medicare and or medicaid reimbursement for a portion of their revenue 
changes in medicare medicaid regulations could adversely impact the company s revenues and collections indirectly by reducing the reimbursement rate received by providers and thus make it less profitable for them to sell or rent products to the end user 
this  in turn  can put downward pressure on prices charged for the company s products sold through this channel 
see business government funding and regulation 
government regulation medical equipment manufactured or sold by the company in the us is subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration fda 
all such medical devices must be the subject of device listings filed with the fda  and medical device manufacturers must be registered 
certain products require clearance by the fda prior to marketing and distribution in the united states 
delays in receiving such approval could adversely affect the company s ability to introduce new products on a timely basis  and could impact the company s results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the company and its products are subject to similar regulation in other countries 
international operations a significant portion of the company s sales in recent years has been derived from its international operations 
the company s international financial results could be significantly affected by such factors as government budgetary pressures and payment policies for healthcare products  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  the conversion of certain european countries to the euro currency and other risks associated with international activities 
year the information about the year status of sunrise medical inc and its subsidiaries included in this report under the heading year compliance is believed to be accurate  but is presented for information purposes only  and is not a contractual commitment or modification of any contract that may exist between sunrise and any third party 
the company disclaims any obligation to update any of the above factors that may affect future operating results to announce publicly the result of any revisions to any of the forward looking statements contained in this report or to make corrections to reflect future events or developments
