the two companies may also choose to co develop and co market the identified new gene therapy products  and  in such case  commercialization rights will be held by the company for north america and by transgene for europe and will be shared equally for the rest of the world s markets 
transgene will pay an initial licensing fee and research funding in an amount equal to the proceeds to transgene from the company s purchase of a interest in transgene

recently  national attention has focused on the potential problems and costs resulting from computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  or engage in similar normal business activities 
while the company believes that its internal software applications are year compliant  there can be no assurance until the year that all systems will function adequately 
further  if the software applications of others on whose services the company depends are not year compliant  such noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on the company
