general the company is a leading provider of design  construction  conversion and repair services for ocean going vessels  offshore rigs and engineered products servicing the offshore energy  government and commercial markets 
the company classifies its business into three segments vessels  rigs  and engineered products 
operations within the vessels segment include the new construction and repair of a wide variety of vessels for the government  energy and commercial markets 
products in this segment include offshore support vessels and offshore double hull tank barges for energy markets  offshore and inland tug boats  ocean going barges and oil spill recovery vessels for commercial markets  and oceanographic survey and research ships  high speed patrol boats and ferries for government markets 
operations within the rigs segment include construction  conversion and repair of mobile offshore drilling rigs 
operations within the engineered products segment include the design  manufacture and marketing of cranes  derricks  winches  hoists  windlasses  jacks  linear winches  fairleads  capstans  tuggers  locking devices  turret bearings  control systems  and other related products used in the marine  offshore and construction industries 
at march   the company had shipyards which are strategically located along the gulf coast from florida to texas 
additionally  the company had four gulf coast manufacturing facilities dedicated to its engineered products segment 
on may   the company acquired all of the shares of common stock of trinity marine orange  inc  a shipyard based in orange  texas 
the shipyard will be utilized in the construction of new offshore rigs as well as components for rigs under construction at other shipyards owned by the company 
as of march   the company had firm contracts with an aggregate remaining value of approximately million excluding unexercised options held by customers  covering construction of a total of vessels  the new construction of six drill barges and one jackup drilling rig  the conversion of two rigs into deepwater semi submersible rigs and the repair or conversion of eight jackup drilling rigs 
the company anticipates that approximately million of the aggregate remaining value of the firm contracts as of march  will be filled during fiscal contracts for the construction of vessels  the construction  conversion and repair of mobile offshore rigs  and the design and manufacture of engineered products are usually awarded on a competitive bid basis 
although the company believes customers consider  among other things  the availability and technical capabilities of equipment and personnel  efficiency  condition of equipment  safety record and reputation  price competition is currently a primary factor in determining which qualified bidder is awarded a contract 
accordingly  the company s strategy is to remain a leader in cost effective marine construction 
the company expects that substantial orders for new offshore support vessels and mobile offshore rigs may be made in the next several years due to the demand for larger vessels and rigs to support deep water oil and gas exploration and production activities  as well as the substantial worldwide fleet attrition over the past ten years and the aging of the remaining fleets 
at march   the company had offshore support vessels  three rigs and six drill barges under contract 
although the company believes there will be an increase in demand for offshore support vessels and mobile offshore rigs  the company cannot predict future levels of activity in offshore oil and gas exploration  development and production 
although the demand for vessels and rigs may temporarily decrease as a result of short term declines in oil prices  the company believes that the overall demand will increase in the long term 
the company also expects to capitalize on the anticipated increase in offshore tank barge construction and conversion resulting from opa and the aging of the worldwide fleet 
the company currently has one offshore double hull tank barge under construction 
in addition  the company is bidding on a number of other offshore barge construction projects 
pursuant to the provisions of a separation agreement with trinity  the company will be prohibited  for four years plus an additional period under certain circumstances after the separation from trinity  from engaging in trinity businesses  which include the construction of inland hopper barges and inland tank barges 
under special arrangements with trinity  the company has built a relatively small number of such vessels 
revenue related to this business was million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the company s gross profit from such activities was million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the company s management does not believe that the restrictions imposed pursuant to the separation agreement will have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
the company believes its current production labor force is at near optimum levels and that its multiple yard strategy and aggressive recruiting of personnel will protect it from labor shortfalls in any one market 
the company has experienced a shift in the production labor force over the past year from contract to permanently employed labor which it expects to result in lower labor costs and production efficiencies which should improve gross margins 
the production labor force grew from  employees at march  to  employees at march   partially as a result of employees added through the company s business acquisitions 
results of operations the following tables set forth certain statement of income information as a percentage of the company s revenue for the periods indicated year ended march  amount percent amount percent amount percent in millions contract revenue earned by business segment vessels rigs engineered products year ended march  amount percent amount percent amount percent in millions contract revenue earned by customer type government vessels energy vessels rigs commercial vessels other vessels engineered products consists of revenue from the company s government customers  including the us navy  state and local governments and foreign governments 
consists of revenue from the construction or conversion of vessels and the construction  conversion and repair of mobile offshore drilling rigs 
vessels include offshore support vessels  offshore double hull barges and tank barges 
consists of revenue from the company s commercial customers and includes vessels such as tugboats  hopper barges  inland tow boats and other vessels 
consists of revenue from customers for the construction of yachts  vessel repairs and assorted marine products and the design and manufacture of engineered products 
fiscal compared with fiscal contract revenue increased to million in the fiscal year ended march  compared with million in the fiscal year ended march  the increase was primarily attributable to million in revenue generated by companies acquired during fiscal the majority of this increase in revenue is reflected within the rigs and engineered products segments of the company 
growth was also experienced within the energy customer group of the vessels segment as a result of increased construction of offshore support vessels and within the other customer group resulting from increased vessel repair and yacht activity 
the decline in government revenue within the vessels segment occurred as fiscal included revenue from a major contract that was not replaced in fiscal the gross profit margin decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal excluding newly acquired companies  the gross margin was 
the decrease in gross margin was due to cost overruns on a ferry being constructed for the state of alaska and certain yachts and certain double hull tank barges  increased costs on other contracts resulting from delays in the production of engineering drawings  inefficiencies resulting from the rapid buildup of the company s labor force  use of more expensive contract labor  and adverse weather conditions during the fourth quarter 
gross profit margins  by segment  for fiscal were vessels   rigs   and engineered products  
the gross margin of the company s vessels segment was also adversely impacted by the company s construction of a large number of new designs for the offshore supply vessel market during fiscal which strained internal capacity and caused delays in the production of engineering drawings  resulting in out of sequence work performed at sub optimal efficiencies 
the company has now developed a broad range of industry and regulatory accepted designs that it will be able to use to fill future orders in the vessels segment which the company believes will contribute to higher margins in the future 
during the year  the company initiated a project to review  evaluate  and improve all of its business processes in the vessels segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million in fiscal  or of revenue  compared to million or of revenue in fiscal the increase is a result of the overall growth of the company during the current year

these increases were offset by decreases in legal fees  million  and research and development expenses  million 
during fiscal  the company initiated a project to review  evaluate and improve all of its business processes in the vessels segment committing approximately million to the project during the year  and it expects to commit additional resources during fiscal the company believes that it will realize cost savings from the project in future periods 
the company s construction backlog increased to million at march  compared to million at march  and consisted of the following as of march engin 
vessels rigs products total vessels in millions backlog by customer type government commercial energy other interest expense  net of interest income  increased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal due to the issuance  by the company  of million in convertible subordinated notes in september and million in taxable revenue bonds in january as a result of its acquisitions during fiscal  the company recorded amortization of excess of cost over net assets acquired of million 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal as the company lowered its estimated annual effective tax rate to reflect the anticipated benefit of research and experimentation credits 
fiscal compared with fiscal contract revenue increased to million in the fiscal year ended march  compared with million  all of which was in the vessels segment  in the fiscal year ended march  an increase in revenue from all customer groups was experienced 
specifically  government revenue increased by million or  energy revenue increased by million or  commercial revenue increased by million or  and other revenue increased by million or 
major new government contracts added in fiscal included a large ferry for a state government and a us navy oceanographic research vessel 
the increase in energy revenue was principally a result of increased construction of offshore support vessels 
the increase in other commercial revenue occurred in part from the construction of five casino barges 
the increase in other revenue was a result of a million increase in revenue from yacht construction as well as increased repair and conversion business 
the gross profit margin decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal this decrease is attributable  in part  to the favorable margin received on a major contract in fiscal the company did not replace that contract with a similarly performing contract in further  fiscal gross profit was favorably impacted by a reduction in the workers compensation reserve 
this benefit was substantially offset by specific writedowns in work in process inventory 
in addition  in fiscal  contracts with energy customers had lower than normal margins reflecting the company s efforts to regain entry into a previously dormant market 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal  an increase of million over fiscal these expenses amounted to of revenue in fiscal compared to of revenue in fiscal the increase in dollar costs was attributed to the general overall growth of the company and the new and additional costs the company incurred as a result of becoming a stand alone enterprise 
specifically  salaries and employee benefit costs increased by million  primarily as a result of increased personnel  and research and development costs increased by million resulting from lower billings to the us government for such costs as compared to fiscal the company s construction backlog increased to million at march  compared to million at march  energy related backlog increased by million and other backlog increased by million 
the increase in energy backlog was attributable to new contracts to build offshore support vessels 
the increase in other backlog was attributable to new contracts to build megayachts 
the above increases were offset by a decrease in government related backlog of million and commercial related backlog of million 
the decrease in government backlog was primarily due to revenue recognition during fiscal on a us navy contract to build two barracks barges and the state of alaska contract to build a foot ferry 
the decrease in commercial backlog was due primarily to completion of a large coal barge in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company s principal needs for capital are the funding of ongoing operations  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
the company s principal sources of liquidity during fiscal were cash provided by operating activities  borrowings from the company s existing credit facility and the issuance of convertible subordinated notes and taxable revenue bonds 
cash flows during fiscal from these sources were million from operating activities  million from the issuance of convertible subordinated notes  and million from the issuance of taxable revenue bonds 
these sources were used primarily to fund the company s working capital requirements  capital expenditures  and acquisitions 
on september   the company issued an aggregate principal amount of million of convertible subordinated notes the notes which mature on september  the notes were issued under an indenture the indenture which provided that the notes are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of common stock of the company at a conversion rate equivalent to per share  subject to adjustment for certain events as defined in the indenture

during fiscal year  the company renegotiated its revolving credit agreement the credit facility with a group of banks  increasing the maximum loan amount from million to million  to be used for general corporate purposes and working capital 
all amounts outstanding under the credit facility will become payable on september  letters of credit are limited to million 
the interest rate is to over the london interbank offering rate libor  or the base rate as defined  depending on the company s choice 
the range of rates over libor is set quarterly  depending on the ratio of the company s borrowed debt to ebitda as defined 
under the credit facility  the company is obligated to pay certain fees  including an annual commitment fee in an amount of 
to 
of the unused portion of the commitment 
the loan agreement contains certain restrictive covenants  including minimum net worth requirements and the encumbering of assets 
in addition  the company  among other things  is required to maintain certain financial ratios  including an interest coverage ratio as defined  a debt service coverage ratio as defined and a current ratio as defined 
at march   the company had no amounts outstanding and million available under the line of credit 
prior to the separation from trinity  a significant portion of the company s existing contracts for the construction  repair or conversion of vessels required that the company s performance be guaranteed by trinity  by a surety company or other third party pursuant to a contract bid or performance bond  letter of credit or similar obligation 
these guarantees  bonds  letters of credit and similar obligations will remain in effect until they expire and trinity will remain liable for the obligations on the same basis as any other guarantor 
the company has indemnified trinity against any liability under these obligations 
for the protection of trinity in the event trinity is called upon to satisfy any such obligations  trinity has been granted security interests in certain assets of the company which relate to the company s contracts from which such obligations arise and possesses the rights to complete performance of any such contract on behalf of the company in the event of nonperformance by the company 
such rights and remedies are similar to the rights possessed by surety companies that have issued performance bonds on behalf of the company 
the company has arranged its own contract bid and performance bonds  letters of credit and similar obligations in connection with its business since september  the company believes that amounts available under the credit facility and bonding commitment will be adequate to meet these obligations as they are required 
as of march   the total of all of the company s outstanding performance obligations was approximately million

the company currently has budgeted  for fiscal  approximately million for planned capital projects  which included the acquisition  on may   for million in cash  of a shipyard located in orange  texas which will be used for the construction of new offshore rigs 
the company believes that cash flow from operations  together with funds available under the existing credit facility  and excess cash generated from the issuance of the convertible subordinated notes and taxable revenue bonds will be sufficient to fund its requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other capital needs for at least the next months 
inflation and changing prices the company does not believe that general price inflation has had a significant impact on the company s results of operations during the periods presented 
to the extent that the effects of inflation are not offset by improvements in manufacturing and purchasing efficiency and labor productivity  the company generally has been able to take such effects into account in pricing its contracts with customers 
there can be no assurance  however  that inflation will not have a material effect on the company s business in the future 
year technological issues the company is currently working to assess the potential impact of the year on the processing of time sensitive information by its computerized information systems and equipment 
year issues may arise if computer programs have been written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
in such case  programs that have time sensitive logic may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in miscalculations or system failures 
management is in the process of completing a review of significant software used in the company s operations  and  to the extent practicable  in the operations of its key business relationships such as vendors  suppliers  and financial institutions  in order to determine if any year risks exist that may be material to the company as a whole 
the company has already begun implementing certain measures to alter  validate or replace time sensitive software prior to any anticipated material impact on its computerized information systems and equipment 
costs of addressing potential problems have not been material to date and  based on preliminary information  are not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows in future periods
