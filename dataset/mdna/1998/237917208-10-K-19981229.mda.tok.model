expenditures of approximately  were directly related to the terminated palms technology development project 
in addition  external costs of approximately  attributable to maintenance of q support quetzal  the next generation help desk product  quetzal sc  released in december  and certain enterprise solutions products were also recorded 
internal engineering and product development expenses were  for the fiscal year ended september   a decrease of  or from  for the fiscal year ended september  this decrease was due to both the discontinuance of certain internal development efforts and the non recurrence of development costs incurred in fiscal relating to the macintosh based product line sold to dr solomon s in october  
selling  general and administrative expenses were  for the fiscal year ended september   a decrease of  or approximately from  for the fiscal year ended september  included in the costs for fiscal were approximately  of one time expenses primarily associated with leased space no longer required as a result of the company s restructuring subsequent to the sale of its macintosh based product line in the first quarter of  and  of administrative and consulting costs associated with the company s second restructuring during the fourth quarter of fiscal included in the expenses for the fiscal year ended september  were  of one time expenses principally associated with organizational changes within the company s european subsidiaries 
excluding these expenses  the decrease would have been  or which is principally attributable to selling expenses associated with the company s macintosh based product line 
in october  the company sold its macintosh based product line to dr solomon s software for  in cash 
the company realized a pre tax gain on the sale of approximately  after the sale of this product line the company initiated a corporate wide restructuring effort so as to allow the company to centralize both its administrative infrastructure and the development efforts of its remaining products

the company has recorded a tax provision in the amount of  for the fiscal year ended september  the company recorded a de minimis tax provision during fiscal year ended september  because of its ability to utilize domestic net operating loss carryforwards nol and foreign losses 
the company s effective tax rate of is primarily the result of utilizing domestic nol and certain credit carryforwards 
such carryforwards have been exhausted in the us although the foreign operations still maintain substantial amounts in carryforwards all currently reserved for 
fiscal year ended september  as compared to fiscal year ended september  net sales for the fiscal year ended september  were  which represents an increase of  or from the net sales of  for the fiscal year ended september  sales have been segregated on the statements of operations so as to highlight the product lines which remain after the disposal of the macintosh based product line

the company s cost of sales for the fiscal year ended september  were  or approximately of net sales 
cost of sales for the fiscal year ended september  were  or approximately of net sales 
the increase in cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  results from the inclusion of guildsoft s product sales which bear lower gross margins than the company s other products 
cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales for the fiscal year ended september   excluding guildsoft  would have been  which is relatively consistent with the prior period 
engineering and product development expenses were  for the fiscal year ended september   an increase of  or approximately from  for the fiscal year ended september  this increase net of approximately  of expenses associated with organizational changes is primarily attributable to the increase in personnel costs and expenses necessary for continued development of the q support quetzal product and quality assurance for the monarch product

this increase is primarily attributable to increases in personnel within the sales and marketing organizations  principally for q support quetzal and monarch  and the inclusion of guildsoft operating expenses amounting to approximately  for the period or approximately of the increase 
as a result of the foregoing  the net loss from operations for the fiscal year ended september  was  which compares to the net income of  for the fiscal year ended september  the company recorded a de minimis tax provision  both domestically and internationally  during the periods because of its ability to utilize nol carryforwards during fiscal and because of its ability to utilize domestic nol carryforwards and foreign losses during fiscal liquidity and capital resources in october  the company received  in cash from dr solomon s software for its virex and netoctopus product lines  resulting in a pre tax gain of approximately  this sale provided working capital in the current year to accomplish internal restructuring plans and fund on going operations 
the company s management believes that its currently anticipated capital needs for future operations of the company will be satisfied through at least september  by funds currently available from the above mentioned sale and funds generated from operations 
the company also has a  line of credit pursuant to a letter agreement with a bank 
currently  advances from the line of credit amount to  beginning as of september   the company was not in compliance with one of the financial covenants contained in the letter agreement with the bank 
the bank has effectively waived through maturity january  a default under the line of credit as a result of the company s non compliance with this financial covenant  but has restricted the company from further advances above the  currently outstanding 
the company is currently negotiating the renewal of the line of credit which expires in january working capital increased by approximately  during fiscal primarily as a result of the above mentioned divestiture offset by outflows for operating activities  costs associated with the restructurings of the company  and discontinued development efforts 
management believes that the company s current operations are not materially impacted by the effects of inflation

in march of  the aicpa released sop  accounting for costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  which requires certain expenditures made for internal use software to be capitalized 
the company is currently studying the impact of sop  which is required to be adopted by the company in october in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the new standard requires that all companies record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
management is currently assessing whether there will be any impact of sfas no 
on the company s consolidated financial statements upon adoption  which is required in october year readiness disclosure statement general the company is aware of the global concerns related to what is known as the year issue and the potential for the associated system failures and business interruptions that may result 
the year issue concerns three main areas the ambiguity that may result from processing and storing data using digit year formats  the recognition that the year is a leap year  and the use of dates most commonly for special programming functions 
any of these problems could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in normal business activities for both the company and its customers who rely on its products 
year compliance program the company has been aware of the year issue for several years and has been actively engaged in correcting year deficiencies as they are recognized  but has not yet completed reviewing  correcting and testing all facets of the year compliance issues facing it 
the company is currently in the process of developing a year compliance program  the purpose of which will be to identify important internal systems that are not yet year compliant  to initiate replacement or remedial action to assure that key systems and products will continue to operate in the year and to test the replaced or remediated systems and products  to identify and contact key suppliers  vendors  customers and business partners to evaluate their ability to maintain normal operations in the year  and to develop appropriate contingency plans for dealing with foreseeable year complications 
the company has appointed a year readiness coordinator who is responsible for developing and administering the company s year compliance program 
the company expects to complete its year compliance plan by the end of january and substantially implement the plan by the end of internal systems based on the preliminary results of the company s assessment of its internal use hardware and software  including telephone systems and other facilities equipment  the company has determined that it may be necessary to modify or replace some of its internal use software and hardware 
during  a project was initiated at the corporate offices in wilmington  massachusetts and at the company s largest subsidiary  datawatch international  in potters bar  england to upgrade the company s accounting software to a year compliant version 
these simultaneous projects were completed in september the company anticipates that the accounting systems at some of its other subsidiaries will be replaced by the end of  however  the accounting systems at these locations are significantly less critical than at the locations already upgraded 
the company currently believes that all other mission critical software is year compliant 
the company anticipates completing a full review of all internal software and hardware by april  the cost to bring internal operations into compliance is estimated to be approximately in early  the company will begin contacting vendors concerning the status of their year readiness 
all supplies used to market  sell or produce the company s products are readily available from many different suppliers  therefore  the company intends that only vendors who are determined to be year compliant will be used for supplies after september  software products the company has designed  tested and continues to test the most current versions of its products for year issues 
the company believes that the latest versions of its products are substantially year compliant and are not likely to pose a significant year liability issue for the company or any significant operational problems for its customers 
the company continues to test the current versions of its products for year compliance  and in the event problems are discovered  the company intends to issue product updates to correct such anomalies 
the company has requested and is waiting to receive year compliance statements from vendors of certain widely accepted database and middleware tools which are used in the development of its products  in the event such tools are not compliant  the company believes achieving compliance will require upgrades to newer versions of such tools 
the company also has performed and continues to perform limited year compliance assessments of certain older versions of its products  and where problems are discovered  will determine the practicality of modifying older versions 
certain of the company s customers use older bit operating systems which are believed not to be year compliant  the company makes available to these customers older bit versions of its software  which in some cases are not year compliant 
the company believes it does not have material financial exposure to customers with respect to older version of its products 
the company estimates testing costs for its products to be approximately  and an additional  for vendor compliance and customer communication 
as the year compliance assessment and or testing of a product is complete  the company will make available information to its customers via the company s web site 
this information may also be communicated to registered customers in news letters or other special mailings 
risks associated with year issue the company believes it will have an effective year compliance program in place prior to the end of which will allow it to identify and correct any year compliance deficiencies 
this assessment is subject to revision based on the results of the company s on going year compliance efforts 
if unforeseen compliance efforts are required or if present compliance efforts are not completed on time  or if the cost of any required updating  modification or replacement of the company s systems or equipment exceeds the company s estimates  the year issue could result in material costs and have a material adverse effect on the company 
however  the company believes that the risk is minimal 
the company utilizes third party vendors for product development and testing 
should these vendors not be compliant in a timely manner  product releases scheduled to take place after december  could be delayed 
the company also utilizes third party vendors for processing data and payments  eg payroll services  k plan administration  check processing  medical benefits processing  etc 
should these vendors not be compliant in a timely manner  the company may be required to process transactions manually or delay processing until such time as the vendors are year compliant 
the company has warranted  to certain customers  that certain of its products are or will be year compliant 
non compliance with these warranties may result in legal action for breach of warranty 
various statements in this discussion of year are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of as discussed below under risk factors 
these statements include statements of the company s expectations  statements with regard to schedules and expected completion dates and statements regarding expected year compliance 
these forward looking statements are subject to various risk factors which may materially affect the company s efforts to achieve year compliance 
these risk factors include the inability of the company to complete in a timely manner the plans and modifications that it has identified  any inaccuracy in the assessment of the cost and financial exposure of the company with respect to current and older versions of the company s products  the failure of software vendors to deliver the upgrades and repairs to which they have committed  the wide variety of information technology systems and components  both hardware and software  that must be evaluated  and the large number vendors and customers with which the company interacts 
the company s assessments of the effects of year on the company are based  in part  upon information received from third parties and the company s reasonable reliance on that information 
therefore  the risk that inaccurate information is supplied by third parties upon which the company reasonably relies must be considered as a risk factor that might affect the company s year efforts 
the company is attempting to reduce the risks by utilizing an organized approach  extensive testing  and allowance of ample contingency time to address issues identified by tests 
contingency plans the company has not established a specific contingency plan at this time 
the company is in the process of developing a general corporate contingency plan which it anticipates will be in place prior to december  the purpose of this plan is to allow the company to recognize system failures  if any  and identify resources needed and available to restore operations in a timely manner 
if the need for an additional year specific contingency plan is recognized  such plan will be developed 
risk factors the company does not provide forecasts of its future financial performance 
however  from time to time  information provided by the company or statements made by its employees may contain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
in particular  statements contained in this form k that are not historical facts including  but not limited to statements contained in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relating to liquidity and capital resources may constitute forward looking statements and are made under the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company s actual results of operations and financial condition have varied and may in the future vary significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  without limitation  the risks  uncertainties and other information discussed below and within this form k  as well as the accuracy of the company s internal estimates of revenue and operating expense levels 
the following discussion of the company s risk factors should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto 
such factors  among others  may have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results the company s future operating results could vary substantially from quarter to quarter because of uncertainties and or risks associated with such things as technological change  competition  delays in the introduction of products or product enhancements and general market trends 
historically  the company has operated with little backlog of orders because its software products are generally shipped as orders are received 
as a result  net sales in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
because the company s staffing and operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of the company s costs are fixed in the short term  small variations in the timing of revenues can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
because of these factors  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience such variations in operating results in the future or that such variations will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operation 
dependence on principal products in fiscal  monarch and q support quetzal accounted for approximately and  respectively  of the company s net sales 
with the disposal of the virex and netoctopus products  the company is wholly dependent on monarch and q support quetzal 
as a result  any factor adversely affecting sales of either of these products could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s future financial performance will depend in part on the successful introduction of its new and enhanced versions of these products and development of new versions of these and other products and subsequent acceptance of such new and enhanced products 
in addition  competitive pressures or other factors may result in significant price erosion that could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
international sales in  and  international sales accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the company s net sales 
the company anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of its net sales 
a significant portion of the company s net sales will therefore be subject to risks associated with international sales  including unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements  changes in tariffs  exchange rates and other barriers  political and economic instability  difficulties in account receivable collection  difficulties in managing distributors or representatives  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  difficulties in protecting the company s intellectual property overseas  seasonality of sales and potentially adverse tax consequences 
acquisition strategy although the company has no current acquisition plans  it has addressed and may continue to address the need to develop new products  in part  through the acquisition of other companies 
acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies and products of the acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which the company has no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
achieving and maintaining the anticipated benefits of an acquisition will depend in part upon whether the integration of the companies business is accomplished in an efficient and effective manner  and there can be no assurance that this will occur 
the successful combination of companies in the high technology industry may be more difficult to accomplish than in other industries 
dependence on new introductions  new product delays growth in the company s business depends in substantial part on the continuing introduction of new products 
the length of product life cycles depends in part on end user demand for new or additional functionality in the company s products 
if the company fails to accurately anticipate the demand for  or encounters any significant delays in developing or introducing  new products or additional functionality on its products  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s business 
product life cycles can also be affected by the introduction by suppliers of operating systems of comparable functionality within their products 
the failure of the company to anticipate the introduction of additional functionality in products developed by such suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
in addition  the company s competitors may introduce products with more features and lower prices than the company s products 
such increase in competition could adversely affect the life cycles of the company s products  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
software products may contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
there can be no assurance that  despite testing by the company and by current and potential end users  errors will not be found in new products after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance 
any failure by the company to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology and customer preferences  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
rapid technological change the markets in which the company competes have undergone  and can be expected to continue to undergo  rapid and significant technological change 
the ability of the company to grow will depend on its ability to successfully update and improve its existing products and market and license new products to meet the changing demands of the marketplace and that can compete successfully with the existing and new products of the company s competitors 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully anticipate and satisfy the changing demands of the personal computer software marketplace  that the company will be able to continue to enhance its product offerings  or that technological changes in hardware platforms or software operating systems  or the introduction of a new product by a competitor  will not render the company s products obsolete 
year issue although the company does not expect that the year issue will have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition  the company is potentially exposed to year issues with respect to internal software and external product offerings 
if the company s internal systems or its products fail to operate properly as a result of year  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted 
the company continues to evaluate the year issue 
see year readiness disclosure statement 
particularly the subsection headed risks associated with year issue which appears immediately before this risk factors section of this report on form k  for a discussion of the company s year readiness and the risks associated with the year issue 
competition in the pc software industry the software market for personal computers is highly competitive and characterized by continual change and improvement in technology 
several of the company s existing and potential competitors including ibm  network associates  inc  remedy  and actuate have substantially greater financial  marketing and technological resources than the company 
no assurance can be given that the company will have the resources required to compete successfully in the future 
dependence on proprietary software technology the company s success is dependent upon proprietary software technology 
although the company does not own any patents on any such technology  it does hold exclusive licenses to such technology and relies principally on a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect its rights to such proprietary technology 
despite such precautions  there can be no assurance that such steps will be adequate to deter misappropriation of such technology 
reliance on software license agreements substantially all of the company s products incorporate third party proprietary technology which is generally licensed to the company on an exclusive  worldwide basis 
failure by such third parties to continue to develop technology for the company and license such technology to the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
litigation the company is currently engaged in litigation with a former independent software developer 
see item  legal proceedings  of this report on form k 
although the company believes that the developer s claims have no merit  an unexpected adverse result in this litigation could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  the legal costs for this litigation may be substantial 
indirect distribution channels during  and  the company derived approximately  and  respectively  of its net sales through resellers  none of which are under the direct control of the company 
the loss of major resellers of the company s products  or a significant decline in their sales  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
other than ingram micro inc  which accounted for approximately   and of the company s  and net sales  respectively  no reseller or other customer accounted for more than of the company s revenues in  or there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract or retain additional qualified resellers or that any such resellers will be able to effectively sell the company s products 
the company seeks to select and retain resellers on the basis of their business credentials and their ability to add value through expertise in specific vertical markets or application programming expertise 
in addition  the company relies on resellers to provide post sales service and support  and any deficiencies in such service and support could adversely affect the company s business 
volatility of stock price as is frequently the case with the stocks of high technology companies  the market price of the company s common stock has been  and may continue to be  volatile 
factors such as quarterly fluctuations in results of operations  increased competition  the introduction of new products by the company or its competitors  expenses or other difficulties associated with assimilating companies acquired by the company  changes in the mix of sales channels  the timing of significant customer orders  and macroeconomic conditions generally  may have a significant impact on the market price of the stock of the company 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings from the levels anticipated by securities analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the market price of the company s common stock in any given period 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market price for many high technology companies and which  on occasion  have appeared to be unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments 
at september   the company did not participate in any derivative financial instruments  or other financial and commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under sfas no 
the company holds no investment securities which would require disclosure of market risk 
primary market risk exposures 
the company s primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the company utilizes us dollar denominated borrowings to fund its operational needs through its  working capital line 
the line  which currently bears an interest rate of prime plus 
at september   is subject to annual renewal 
had the interest rates under the line of credit been greater or lesser than actual rates  the impact would not have been material in the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended september  as of september   the company had  outstanding on its working capital line 
the company s exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations has been and is expected to continue to be modest due to the fact that the operations of its international subsidiaries are almost exclusively conducted in their respective local currencies 
international subsidiary operating results are translated into us dollars and consolidated for reporting purposes 
the impact of currency exchange rate movements on intercompany transactions was immaterial for fiscal currently the company does not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
