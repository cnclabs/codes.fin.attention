earnings summary the company s net income for was  compared with net income for of  an increase of  or

for the years ended december   and  net interest income was   and  respectively 
this represents an increase in of   and an increase in of  
increased net interest income contributed significantly to the net income growth during the period 
average earning assets increased to  in from  in  an increase of  
average loans increased  to  in increasing loan balances were a primary driver for the increase in net interest income during increases in security balances were also a source of growth in net interest income 
as part of its efforts to manage interest rate risk  the company increased its balances of fixed rate securities 
as interest rates declined  this contributed to an increase in the unrealized gain on securities net of tax to  at december  from  at december  increases in loans and securities were funded through significant increases in time deposits 
average deposits increased  to  in from  in the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  information regarding the average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the dollar amount of interest income and interest expense  and the resulting yield on average earning assets and rates on average interest bearing liabilities 
average balances are also provided for non earning assets  non interest bearing liabilities and shareholders equity

the net interest margin represents net interest income as a percent of average earning assets 
the net interest margin decreased to in from in  but was still up from in the most significant reason for the decrease in the net interest margin in was the increase in security balances 
while this strategy reduced interest rate risk  enhanced net interest income  and resulted in significant unrealized gains  it also reduced the net interest margin 
had the company not initiated this transaction during  the net interest margin would have increased between and in addition  during  the company repositioned much of its securities portfolio to be longer term as part of a strategy to balance interest rate risk  further contributing to the increase in the unrealized gain on securities  and locking in a higher rate of return on that portfolio 
the following table presents the change in interest income or interest expense which is attributable to the change in the average balance volume and the change in interest income or interest expense which is related to change in rates 
changes in balances were responsible for an increase in net interest income of  during as both securities and loans grew and were funded by growth in time deposits and  to some extent  savings deposits 
the most significant change due to rate was the increase in the yield on securities  more than offsetting declines in net interest income resulting from lower loan rates 
also  deposit rates were generally lower in as compared to  despite the significant growth in balances

the increase in revenue from the trust investment management group in is reflective of the continuing sales effort and the increased focus on growth 
management believes that the trust investment management group possesses a competitive advantage by offering customers local trust and funds management services 
service charges on deposit accounts and other retail related fees increased  to  during following an increase of  in fee income increased for a variety of services 
fees charged to customers for overdrawn accounts were up in  as were fees charged to business customers who did not maintain significant balances but utilized a variety of cash management related services 
peoples provides free access to automated teller machines to customers who maintain checking accounts with the bank  but implemented a fee for non customers who use peoples bank automated teller machines 
this new fee produced  during  an increase from  in when the fee was only in place for six months 
mortgage banking revenue includes net gains and losses realized when mortgage loans are sold into the secondary market  service fee revenue earned from servicing those loans after they are sold and  in  a gain on the sale of loan servicing rights 
mortgage banking revenue  as reflected in the company s financial statements  has not been reduced by the associated costs  such as compensation expense  which is shown elsewhere within non interest expense 
mortgage banking revenue was  in   in and  in this reflects a decrease in of  against a decrease in of  
the sale of loan servicing rights during generated  the decrease in mortgage banking revenue can be attributed to a change in strategy which focused peoples on generating less volume  with an emphasis on loans which would not be sold into the secondary market but would remain on the balance sheet 
at december  the company serviced mortgage loans with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of approximately million 
the company does not engage in the purchase and sale of securities with the intent to generate gains 
the company may sell available for sale securities for liquidity or to manage its asset liability position 
during  such sales  as well as gains and losses realized when securities were called prior to their maturity  generated net losses of  compared to net losses of  during non interest expense non interest expense  or overhead  includes the costs of personnel  occupancy  equipment  insurance  and other costs of sustaining operations 
overhead for the years ended december  and was   and  respectively 
this reflects an increase of  in compared to a decrease of  in more than half of total non interest expense is comprised of salaries and employee benefits 
salaries and employee benefit expense increased  compared to a decrease of  in during  peoples added staff in critical areas to enhance its sales and service capacity and to accommodate the bank s strong growth 
the decrease in salary and benefit expense during resulted from the reorganization of certain operations to improve process efficiency 
advertising expense increased  in  following a decrease of  in fdic insurance expense was  during  up from  in  but down from  during as a result of changes in the fdic s assessment rate 
other expenses increased  due to increases in training and professional services aimed at improving the bank s ability to increase market share  retain existing relationships  and improve profitability 
income taxes the company s income tax expense was affected primarily by the level of pre tax income 
as income increased  tax expense did as well 
tax expense for increased  following an increase of  during the company can and does purchase tax free securities and originates tax free loans as a means of generating tax free income  effectively mitigating tax expense 
the company also has invested in several low income housing tax partnerships with the intent of generating lower income tax expense in future years  in addition to serving the community by providing subsidized housing for lower income families 
another measure of the company s tax expense is the effective tax rate 
it increased from in to in to in without tax favored and tax credit producing investments  the company s maximum effective tax rate would be approximately 
net deferred tax assets at december  and were  and  deferred tax assets result  primarily  from book bad debt deductions in excess of those deductible for tax purposes 
the asset will be realized as loans are charged off in future periods 
based on the company s historical levels of taxable income and the relatively small size of the deferred tax assets recorded  management does not believe a valuation allowance for those assets was needed at december  asset and liability management the company engages in a formal process of measuring and defining the amount of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the effect on net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates 
the goal of the asset and liability management process is to maintain a high  yet stable  net interest margin by identifying the degree of interest rate risk and developing tactics and strategies to mitigate the extent to which net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates 
the following tables illustrate the repricing opportunities  or rate sensitivity  of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
a repricing may occur if the rate on the asset or liability changes as interest rates change  or  when the rate is fixed  at the time they mature 
the gap is the difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities within a specific time frame 
gap is considered an indicator of the effect a change in interest rates may have on net interest income 
at december  repriceable or maturing within to to months to after months months to year years years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets loans       available for sale securities       total interest earning assets       interest bearing liabilities savings accounts   time deposits      short term borrowings   total interest bearing liabilities      asset liability gap       cumulative asset liability gap      cumulative gap to total assets as of december   the company s rate sensitive liabilities exceeded rate sensitive assets through one year 
this would indicate that when rates increase  net interest income may decline 
in order to accurately determine the effect of changes in interest rates  the repricing effect of each type of interest earning asset and interest bearing liability must be measured 
assets and liabilities have different characteristics and the magnitude of change differs for each 
management continually monitors the changes to net interest income which may result from changing interest rates 
a significant assumption that creates the large negative gap in the to month category is that all interest bearing demand and savings accounts are subject to immediate repricing 
while it is true that contractually  those accounts are subject to immediate repricing  the rates paid on those accounts are not generally tied to specific indices and are influenced by market conditions and other factors 
accordingly  a general movement in interest rates  either up or down  may not have any immediate effect on the rates paid on these deposit accounts 
the foregoing table illustrates only one source of information about sensitivity to interest rate movements 
the core of the company s asset and liability management process consists of simulations that take into account the time that various assets and liabilities may reprice and the degree to which various categories of such assets and liabilities will respond to general interest rate movements 
interest rate risk can only be represented by a measurement of the effects of changing interest rates given the capacity for and magnitude of change on specific assets and liabilities 
liquidity liquidity refers to the availability of funds to meet deposit withdrawals  fund loan commitments and pay expenses 
the company s loan portfolio  excluding loans held for sale  increased to  at december  from  at december   an increase of  
increases in deposits provided funding for loan growth in total deposits at december  were  an increase of  from balances of  at december  a measure of liquidity is the loan to deposit ratio 
as of december  the net loan to deposit ratio was in  and in at these levels  management believes that peoples had adequate liquidity to meet its current and future needs 
loan commitments include unfunded portions of lines of credit and commercial letters of credit 
these unfunded commitments may or may not require funding 
at december  and  such commitments totaled  and  respectively 
loan commitments generate fee income for the company 
loan quality the company has maintained a high level of quality in the loan portfolio 
non performing loans are those loans which are past due more than days and still accruing interest  and those loans on which the company no longer accrues interest 
as of december  and  non performing loans totaled  and  respectively 
as a percent of total loans  non performing loans were 
at december  and 
at december  loans are considered impaired if full principal or interest payments are not anticipated 
impaired loans are carried at the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
a portion of the allowance for loan losses is allocated to impaired loans 
the company s average investment in impaired loans during and was  and  respectively 
at december    of loans were deemed to be impaired and  of the allowance for loan losses was allocated to those loans 
the loans that are classified as impaired and are still accruing interest are generally collateralized and currently making payments 
however  based on past experience with the customer and their analysis of the situation  management believes that it is not probable that these loans will be repaid in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
as a result  management classifies these loan relationships as impaired 
the provision for loan losses is a charge to earnings to provide for potential loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was  in   in and  in the increase in the provision for loan losses in and was considered necessary by management to maintain the allowance at a desirable level and provide for the substantial loan growth during the years 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated at least quarterly by management based upon a review of identified loans with more than a normal degree of risk  historical loss percentages  and present and forecast economic conditions affecting borrowers 
at december  the allowance for loan losses was  for and  for as a percent of total loans  the allowance for loan losses was at december  and at december  management s analysis indicates that the allowance for loan losses at december  was adequate to cover potential losses on identified loans with credit problems and on the remaining portfolio based on historical percentages

capital position both the company and peoples are required to comply with capital requirements promulgated by their primary regulators 
those regulations require the maintenance of specified levels of capital to total assets the leverage ratio and to risk weighted assets the risk based capital ratio 
these regulations require maintaining a leverage ratio of for sound entities and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
the company and peoples were in full compliance with all regulatory capital requirements at december  the table indicates the company s actual capital levels at the dates indicated

 reporting comprehensive income  is effective for both interim and year end financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  and establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components revenues  expenses  gains and losses in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
comprehensive income is defined as all changes in equity other than those resulting from investments by owners or distributions to owners 
net income is  therefore  a component of comprehensive income 
while full disclosure for each reported period is required in year end financial statements  interim financial statements need only disclose total comprehensive income for each reported period 
the standard does not mandate a specific format for reporting comprehensive income  but does require that all items that are required to be recognized as components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements 
implementation of this standard will require additional disclosures in future financial reports but will not otherwise affect the company 
financial accounting standard no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  is effective for reported periods included in year end financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  and for all reported periods in interim financial statements for reporting periods following the first required full fiscal year disclosures 
fas no 
establishes new guidance for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected information about reportable operating segments in interim financial reports issued to shareholders 
fas no 
supersedes the industry approach to segment disclosures previously required by fas no 
 financial reporting for segments of business enterprise  replacing it with a method of segment reporting which is based on the structure of an enterprise s internal organization reporting 
the statement also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
management expects that implementation of this standard may result in the identification of other reportable business segments 
year compliance because computer memory was so expensive on early mainframe computers  some computer programs used only the final two digits for the year in the date field and assumed that the first two digits were as a result  some computer applications may be unable to interpret the change from year to year peoples has identified a number of critical software vendors  and is in the process of communicating with each vendor about their compliance with the year issue 
peoples has no internally generated code  and all of its core processing is supplied by fiserv  one of the nation s leading software suppliers for community banks 
management believes that peoples core processing systems will be year compliant by the middle of  and anticipates completion of testing by the end of as a result  management does not believe that the year issue represents a significant risk to peoples operations  and the expense in connection with year compliance is not expected to be material to its overall financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a derivative financial instrument includes futures  forwards  interest rate swaps  option contracts  and other financial instruments with similar characteristics 
peoples has entered into variable pay interest rate swaps in the notional amount of million with other financial institutions 
this means that peoples receives a fixed rate of interest calculated on million and pays a variable rate of interest calculated on million 
these swaps were purchased to hedge risk because peoples had funded growth in variable rate assets with fixed rate cd s 
if interest rates declined  bank earnings would have decreased on variable rate loans  which would have been offset with earnings on the swaps 
the board of directors has approved a policy regarding derivative financial instruments  and has included limits on the use of these instruments tied to the term of the swap and the credit risk of the other financial institution 
peoples is also a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and may require collateral from the borrower if deemed necessary by peoples 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by peoples to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party up to a stipulated amount and with specified terms and conditions 
commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are not recorded as an asset or liability by the company until the instrument is exercised 
peoples exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the asset liability committee 
interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes 
these economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and or a loss of current fair market values 
the objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximize income 
management realizes that certain risks are inherent and the goal is to identify and minimize the risks 
tools used by management include the standard gap report and a recently instituted interest rate shock simulation report 
peoples has no market risk sensitive instruments held for trading purposes 
it appears that peoples market risk is reasonable at this time
