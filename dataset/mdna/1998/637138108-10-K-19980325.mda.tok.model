item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and is intended to assist in understanding and evaluating the major changes in the financial condition and earnings results of operations of the company with a primary focus on the company s performance 
financial condition during total assets increased to billion  an increase of million or over the billion at year end total assets at the end of increased million or over the billion at year end total cash and cash equivalents decreased 
million or in compared to versus an increase of 
million or in compared to the decrease in is due to the maintenance of vault cash in branch locations  as well as a decrease in the level of interest bearing deposits in banks 
net loans and leases increased to billion during  an increase of million or compared to net loans increased million in or compared to loan growth in was primarily the result of the investment of deposits and long term borrowings 
residential mortgages originated for immediate resale during amounted to million 
the company s credit quality is reflected by the annualized ratio of net chargeoffs to total loans of 
for versus 
for the year  and the ratio of nonperforming assets to total loans of 
at december   compared to at december  nonperforming assets  including nonaccruals  loans days past due  restructured loans and other real estate owned  were million at december   compared to million at december  of these amounts  nonaccrual loans represented million and million at december   and december   respectively 
loans days past due and still accruing interest were million and million at december   and december   respectively 
other real estate owned was  and  at december   and december   respectively 
the company had no restructured loans at december  or december  the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming assets was and at december   and december   respectively 
as is evident from the above amounts relative to nonperforming assets  there have been no significant changes between december   and december  the company has no significant exposure to energy and agricultural related loans 
investments  which are the company s secondary use of funds  increased million or to million at year end in  the investment portfolio reflected a decrease of million or compared to the increase in was due to investment purchases of million  primarily in municipal securities  which were partially offset by calls and maturities of securities  securities sales and payments on mortgage backed securities 
at year end  the fasb provided a one time window of opportunity for reclassifying investments accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
as a result  the company designated its entire investment portfolio as available for sale 
changes in the market value of these securities are accounted for  net of tax  as an adjustment to shareholder s equity 
because sfas explicitly allows for a held to maturity category for investment securities  reclassifications from the held to maturity category that resulted from the one time reassessment will not call into question the intent of the company to hold investment securities to maturity in the future 
proceeds from the sale of investment securities in were million  on which a net gain of million was recognized 
as the primary source of funds  aggregate deposits of billion increased million or compared to deposits of million increased million in or compared to in addition to deposits  growth in earning assets has been funded somewhat through purchased funds and borrowings 
these include securities sold under repurchase agreements  federal funds purchased  short term borrowings  and long term borrowings 
in the aggregate  these funds totaled million at the end of  a million or increase compared to the amount of borrowings and purchased funds of million represented an increase of million or compared to the increase in  was due to the issuance of million in junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures and an increase in long term obligations of million which was partially offset by a decrease in short term borrowings  primarily securities sold under repurchase agreements and federal funds purchased 
shareholders equity increased by million or in to million 
this increase was due primarily to the retention of earnings and reinvestment of cash dividends under the company s dividend reinvestment plan 
cash dividends paid in increased  or compared to the cash dividends paid in which increased  or compared to cash dividends paid in earnings retained in were compared to in results of operations net income for of million was more than the million reported in the amount was more than the million in on a per share basis  basic earnings were  and for  and  respectively 
diluted earnings per share were  and for  and respectively 
net interest income is the difference between interest income on assets and interest expense on liabilities 
net interest income increased million or to million in from the amount of million 
the increase in interest income is a result of growth in average loans outstanding and higher rates on loans that were partially offset by growth in average deposits and higher rates on deposits and borrowings 
interest rate risk is a major concern in forecasting the earnings potential 
the company s prime rate from january  to march  was 
on march   the prime rate changed to 
in  the company s prime rate was through january  on february  the prime rate changed to 
net interest income in increased million or to million from interest expense during increased million or compared to the prior year due to higher interest rates on deposits and long term borrowings 
interest expense during increased million or compared to despite the current rate environment  the cost of attracting and holding deposited funds is an ever increasing expense in the banking industry 
these increases are the real costs of deposit accumulation and retention  including fdic insurance costs  marketing and branch overhead expenses 
such costs are necessary for continued growth and to maintain and increase market share of available deposits 
the provision for loan and lease losses is determined by periodic reviews of loan quality  current economic conditions  loss experience and loan growth 
based on these factors  the provision for loan and lease losses increased  to  for the provision for loan and lease losses was  for and  for the allowance for loan and lease losses of million at year end and million at year end as a percentage of total loans was for both and  respectively 
net loan charge offs of   and  during  and  respectively  continue to be comparable with those of the company s peers 
the increase in other income in compared to was  or as a result of increased gains on sale of investment securities and mortgages of  increased other service charges and fees of  increased service charges on deposit accounts of  increased trust income of  and increased equity in undistributed net earnings of affiliates of  the increase in other income in compared to was  million or and was due to increased service charges on deposit accounts of  increased trust income of  increased other service charges and fees of  and increased equity in undistributed net earnings of affiliates of  net gains on sales of investment securities and mortgages decreased  in compared to sales of investment securities in and totaled million and million  respectively 
total other expenses increased  or in when compared to by category  the company s salaries  wages and employee benefits increased  other operating expenses increased  net premises and equipment increased  while fdic assessment decreased  due to lower fdic insurance premiums on bank deposits and a one time rebate of the fourth quarter assessment 
total other expenses increased  or in when compared to by category  the company s salaries  wages and employee benefits increased  other operating expenses increased  and net premises and equipment increased  while fdic assessment decreased  due to lower fdic insurance premiums on all commercial bank deposits partially offset by a one time fdic assessment in the amount of  on approximately million of thrift deposits acquired from sellersville savings and loan association and central pennsylvania savings association 
for  and  there are no individual items of other operating expenses that exceed one percent of the aggregate of total interest income and other income  with the exception of advertising and marketing related expenses 
income before income taxes increased in by  or compared to when income before income taxes increased by  or compared to income taxes decreased  in compared to when income taxes increased  compared to liquidity and interest rate sensitivity the primary functions of asset liability management are to assure adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of customers who may be either depositors wanting to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs 
funding affecting short term liquidity  including deposits  repurchase agreements  federal funds purchased  and short term borrowings increased million during long term borrowings increased million during as described in footnote to the financial statements  cash flow was increased by a million debt offering on may  the goal of interest rate sensitivity management is to avoid fluctuating net interest margins  and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
such sensitivity is measured as the difference in the volume of assets and liabilities in the existing portfolio that are subject to repricing in a future time period 
the following table shows separately the interest rate sensitivity of each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  repricing periods within three months one year three through through over months one year five years five years assets in thousands interest bearing deposits at banks  investment securities     loans and leases     other assets   liabilities and equity non interest bearing deposits  interest bearing deposits     borrowed funds     other liabilities  hedging instruments   shareholders equity  interest sensitivity gap     cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap    adjustable rate loans are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period in which they are due 
fixed rate loans are included in the period in which they are scheduled to be repaid and are adjusted to take into account estimated prepayments based upon assumptions estimating the prepayments in the interest rate environment prevailing during the fourth calendar quarter of the table assumes prepayments and scheduled principal amortization of fixed rate loans and mortgage backed securities  and assumes that adjustable rate mortgages will reprice at contractual repricing intervals 
there has been no adjustment for the impact of future commitments and loans in process 
savings and now deposits are scheduled for repricing based on historical deposit decay rate analyses  as well as historical moving averages of run off for the company s deposits in these categories 
while generally subject to immediate withdrawal  management considers a portion of these accounts to be core deposits having significantly longer effective maturities based upon the company s historical retention of such deposits in changing interest rate environments 
specifically  of these deposits are considered repriceable within three months and are considered repriceable in the over five years category 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the company s assets and liabilities 
these characteristics include the volume of assets and liabilities repricing  the timing of the repricing  and the relative levels of repricing 
attempting to minimize the interest rate sensitivity gaps is a continual challenge in a changing rate environment 
based on the company s gap position as reflected in the above table  current accepted theory would indicate that net interest income would increase in a falling interest rate environment and would decrease in a rising interest rate environment 
an interest rate gap table does not  however  present a complete picture of the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income 
first  changes in the general level of interest rates do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously 
second  assets and liabilities which can contractually reprice within the same period may not  in fact  reprice at the same time or to the same extent 
third  the table represents a one day position  variations occur daily as the company adjusts its interest sensitivity throughout the year 
fourth  assumptions must be made to construct such a table 
for example  non interest bearing deposits are assigned a repricing interval of within three months  although history indicates a significant amount of these deposits will not move into interest bearing categories regardless of the general level of interest rates 
finally  the repricing distribution of interest sensitive assets may not be indicative of the liquidity of those assets 
gap analysis is a useful measurement of asset and liability management  however  it is difficult to predict the effect of changing interest rates based solely on this measure 
therefore  the company supplements gap analysis with the calculation of the economic value of equity 
this report forecasts changes in the company s market value of portfolio equity mvpe under alternative interest rate environments 
the mvpe is defined as the net present value of the company s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments 
the calculated estimates of change in mvpe at december  are as follows mvpe change in interest rate amount change in thousands basis points  basis points  basis points  flat rate  basis points  basis points  basis points  management believes that the assumptions utilized in evaluating the vulnerability of the company s earnings and capital to changes in interest rates approximate actual experience  however  the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities as well as the estimated effect of changes in interest rates on mvpe could vary substantially if different assumptions are used or actual experience differs from the experience on which the assumptions were based 
in the event the company should experience a mismatch in its desired gap ranges or an excessive decline in its mvpe subsequent to an immediate and sustained change in interest rate  it has a number of options which it could utilize to remedy such mismatch 
the company could restructure its investment portfolio through the sale or purchase of securities with more favorable repricing attributes 
it could also emphasize loan products with appropriate maturities or repricing attributes  or it could attract deposits or obtain borrowings with desired maturities 
the company anticipates volatile interest rate levels in given this assumption  the company s asset liability strategy for is to remain in a negative gap position interest bearing liabilities subject to repricing greater than interest earning assets subject to repricing for periods up to a year 
the impact of a volatile interest rate environment on net interest income is not expected to be significant to the company s results of operations 
effective monitoring of these interest sensitivity gaps is the priority of the company s asset liability management committee 
capital adequacy the following table sets forth certain capital performance ratios for the company 
capital levels tier leverage ratio tier risk based ratio total risk based ratio capital performance return on average assets return on average equity earnings retained the company s capital ratios above compare favorably to the minimum required amounts of tier and total capital to risk weighted assets and the minimum tier leverage ratio  as defined by banking regulators 
at december   the company was required to have minimum tier and total capital ratios of and  respectively  and a minimum tier leverage ratio of 
in order for the company to be considered well capitalized  as defined by banking regulators  the company must have tier and total capital ratios of and  respectively  and a minimum tier leverage ratio of 
the company currently meets the criteria for a well capitalized institution  and management believes that  under current regulations  the company will continue to meet its minimum capital requirements in the foreseeable future 
the company does not presently have any commitments for significant capital expenditures 
the company is not under any agreement with regulatory authorities nor is it aware of any current recommendations by the regulatory authorities which  if they were to be implemented  would have a material effect on liquidity  capital resources or operations of the company 
in december  the company s board of directors approved the repurchase of up to  shares of its common stock to be used for the company s dividend reinvestment  stock option  employee stock purchase plans  and other stock based corporate plans 
the stock repurchase plan authorizes the company to make repurchases from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
at december   a total of shares have been repurchased at an aggregate cost of  a prior repurchase program of  shares authorized in june was completed in december future outlook based on a preliminary study  the company expects to spend approximately  in to modify its computer information systems enabling proper processing of transactions relating to the year and beyond 
the company has evaluated appropriate courses of corrective action  including replacement of certain systems whose associated costs would be recorded as assets and amortized 
accordingly  the company does not expect the amounts required to be expensed over the next three years to have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
the amount expensed in was immaterial 
in  the company intends to open up to one new supermarket branch and will possibly close one supermarket branch 
additionally  the company is converting its mainframe hardware and software systems to new fully integrated systems in may these new systems will offer improved operating efficiencies and enhanced customer service and reporting 
these new initiatives  if completed  are not expected to start contributing to profits until and beyond so that earnings may be somewhat negatively impacted by the initial costs of these new items
