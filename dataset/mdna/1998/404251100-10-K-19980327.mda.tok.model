industry 
according to the business and institutional furniture manufacturer s association bifma  us office furniture industry shipments are estimated to be approximately  in  have grown at a compound annual growth rate of approximately over the three year period ended december  the company believes that growth in the office furniture industry is being driven by changing customer needs due to the emergence of open office floor plans to support team work environments  shared and multi purpose office spaces for flexible work arrangements  new office technology which requires furniture systems that support the use of hardware and software  and an increased focus on ergonomics and employee comfort 
the us office furniture market consists of two primary segments the project segment and the transactional segment 
the project segment has traditionally been characterized by one time sales of large quantities of office furniture to large corporations  such as for new office facilities  relocations or department or office redesigns  which are frequently customized to meet specific client and designer preferences 
project furniture is generally purchased through office furniture dealers who typically prepare a custom designed office layout emphasizing image and design 
the process is often lengthy and generally has several manufacturers competing for the same projects 
overhead and support associated with the sales and customization efforts in this segment are major reasons why the prices for project office furniture have traditionally been relatively high 
the transactional segment of the market  in which the company is a leader  primarily represents smaller orders of office furniture purchased by businesses and home office users on the basis of price  quality  selection and quick delivery 
office products dealers  wholesalers and retailers  such as office products superstores  are the primary distribution channels in this market segment 
office products dealers many of whom also participate in the project segment of the market publish periodic catalogs that display office furniture and products from various manufacturers

manufacturing 
the hon company manufactures office furniture in california  georgia  iowa  kentucky  mississippi  north carolina  pennsylvania  south carolina  tennessee  texas  and virginia 
bpi inc manufactures office furniture in california  north carolina  and washington 
holga inc manufactures office furniture in california 
the gunlocke company manufactures office furniture in new york 
hearth technologies inc manufactures hearth products in iowa  minnesota  and alberta  canada 
the company purchases raw materials and components from a variety of vendors  and generally most items are available from multiple sources 
major raw materials and components include coil steel  bar stock  castings  lumber  veneer  particle board  fabric  paint  lacquer  hardware  rubber products  plastic products  and shipping cartons 
since its inception  the company has focused on making its manufacturing facilities and processes more flexible while at the same time reducing costs and improving product quality 
in  the company adopted the principles of rci  which focus on developing flexible and efficient design  manufacturing and administrative processes that remove excess cost 
to achieve flexibility and attain efficiency goals  the company has adopted a variety of production techniques including cell manufacturing  focused factories  just in time inventory management and value engineering 
the application of the rci process has increased productivity by reducing set up and processing times  square footage  inventory levels  product costs and delivery times  while improving quality and enhancing member safety 
the company s rci process involves production and administrative employees  management  customers and suppliers 
the company has facilitators  coaches and consultants dedicated to the rci process and strives to involve all members in the rci process 
in addition  the company has organized a group that designs  fabricates  tests and installs proprietary manufacturing equipment 
manufacturing also plays a key role in the company s concurrent product development process that primarily seeks to design new products for ease of manufacturability 
product development 
the company s product development efforts are primarily focused on reducing the cost to manufacture existing products and designing new products that provide additional features and quality 
the company accomplishes this through improving existing products  extending product lines  applying ergonomic research  improving manufacturing processes  applying alternative materials and providing engineering support and training to its operating units 
the company conducts its product development efforts at both the corporate and operating unit level 
at the corporate level  the staff at the company s stanley howe technical center  working in conjunction with operating staff  seeks breakthrough developments in product design  manufacturability and materials usage 
at the operating unit level  development efforts are focused on achieving incremental improvements in product features and manufacturing processes 
the company invested approximately million  million  and million in product development during fiscal  and  respectively  and has budgeted in excess of million for product development in fiscal intellectual property 
as of january   the company owns us and foreign patents and has applications pending for us and foreign patents 
in addition  the company holds registrations for us and foreign trademarks  and has applications pending for us and foreign trademarks 
the company s principal office furniture products do not require frequent technical changes 
the majority of the company s patents are design patents which expire at various times depending on the patent s date of issuance 
the company believes that neither any individual patents nor the company s patents in the aggregate are material to the company s business as a whole 
when hearth technologies acquired heat n glo in october  it also acquired its patent for the design of a zero clearance direct vent gas fireplace the direct vent patent 
the direct vent design replaces the traditional top venting chimney system by permitting the exhaust pipe to traverse a structure s exterior wall 
the sealed combustion chamber of the direct vent gas fireplace increases indoor air quality by using outside rather than inside air for combustion and the direct vent design achieves heating efficiency  which means that the patented direct vent gas fireplaces are an efficient alternative heat source in individual rooms 
the direct vent gas fireplaces are highly versatile for use in home design because the direct vent design eliminates the need for a traditional chimney system with top venting  thus opening the space above the fireplace up for use 
the company currently offers numerous product designs that would not be possible without the direct vent technology 
additionally  since a chimney is not employed in the direct vent design  the cost of adding a new fireplace to a home is greatly reduced 
the direct vent patent has been successfully enforced against numerous infringers 
hearth technologies presently is engaged as a plaintiff in two patent infringement cases involving this patent 
final disposition of these cases is not likely for several years 
although the company believes that the protection afforded by the direct vent patent is not vital to sustaining hearth technologies gross profit margins on its direct vent gas fireplaces due to other technological innovations that support the direct vent design  the technology that underlies the patent is a significant distinguishing feature for the company s products 
the company applies for patent protection when it believes the expense of doing so is justified  and believes that the duration of its registered patents is adequate to protect these rights 
the company also pays royalties in certain instances for the use of patents on products and processes owned by others 
the company actively protects its trademarks which it believes have significant goodwill value 
sales and distribution customers 
over the last ten years  the office products and office furniture industries have experienced substantial consolidation as larger dealers have acquired smaller local and regional dealers 
consolidation permits large dealers to benefit from economies of scale  increased purchasing power and the elimination of redundant management and overhead expenses 
larger dealers have also been able to take advantage of more sophisticated management techniques designed to enhance customer service  lower costs and increase operating efficiency 
at the same time  office products superstores have emerged and replaced local  retail office supply stores 
the company believes that these trends may continue to result in fewer  larger dealers and retailers as customers for the company s products 
in  the company s ten largest customers represented approximately of its consolidated net sales 
the increased purchasing power exercised by large customers may adversely affect the prices at which the company can successfully offer its products 
as a result of this consolidation  changes in the purchase patterns or the loss of a single customer may have a greater impact on the company s financial results that such events would have had prior to such consolidation 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its customer relationships as consolidation of its customers occur 
as a result of these trends  the company today sells its products through five principal distribution channels 
the first channel  independent  local office furniture and office products dealers  specialize in the sale of a broad range of office furniture and office furniture systems  mostly to small and medium sized businesses  branch offices of large corporations and home office owners 
the second distribution channel comprises nationwide chains of office products dealers  or mega dealers  including boise cascade corporation  bt office products international  inc  us office products company  corporate express inc  office depot inc 
business services division and staples commercial advantage 
many of the independent dealers and mega dealer locations assist their customers with the evaluation of office space requirements  systems lay out and product selection  and design and office solution services provided by professional designers 
the third distribution channel  wholesalers  serve as distributors of the company s products to independent dealers  mega dealers and superstores 
the company sells to the nation s largest wholesalers  united stationers and sp richards  as well as to smaller  regional wholesalers 
wholesalers maintain stocks of standard product lines for resale to dealers 
they also special order products from the company in customer selected models and colors 
the company s wholesalers maintain warehouse locations throughout the united states  which enable the company to make its products available for rapid delivery to dealers anywhere in the country 
one customer  united stationers  accounted for approximately   and of the company s consolidated net sales in   and  respectively 
the fourth distribution channel is retail stores  which include office products superstores such as office depot  office max and staples  and warehouse clubs like sam s club and costco 
the fifth distribution channel consists of government focused dealers that sell the company s products to federal  state and local government offices in accordance with contract terms to which the company has agreed 
as of january   the company s office furniture sales force consisted of regional sales managers supervising salespersons  plus approximately firms of independent manufacturers representatives  who collectively provided national sales coverage 
sales managers and salespersons are compensated by a combination of salary and incentive bonus 
office products dealers  national wholesalers and retailers market their products through catalogs published periodically and distributed to existing and potential customers 
the company s marketing objective is to gain share in its customers catalogs 
the company believes that the inclusion of the company s product lines in customer catalogs offers strong potential for increased sales of the listed product items due to the exposure provided by these publications 
the company also makes export sales through hon export limited to approximately office furniture dealers and wholesale distributors serving select foreign markets 
distributors are principally located in latin america and the caribbean 
the company has an international field sales organization consisting of a vice president of sales and marketing and four regional managers 
sales outside of the united states and canada represented approximately of net sales in fiscal limited quantities of select finished goods inventories are maintained at the company s principal manufacturing plants and at its various distribution centers 
hearth technologies inc sells its fireplace and stove products through approximately  dealers and distributors 
the company has a field sales organization of regional sales managers supervising salespersons and firms of independent manufacturers representatives 
as of january   the company has an order backlog of approximately million which will be filled in the ordinary course of business within the current fiscal year 
this compares with million as of december   and million as of december  backlog  in terms of percentage of net sales  was   and for fiscal years   and  respectively 
the dollar amount of the ongoing backlog of orders at any point in time is not considered by management to be a leading indicator of the company s expected sales for any particular fiscal period 
large dollar amounts of order backlogs are unusual since most of the company s products are manufactured and shipped within a few weeks following receipt of order  and a low backlog is an indicator of responsive customer service 
for a discussion of the seasonal nature of the company s sales  see business segment information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
competition 
the office furniture industry is highly competitive  with a significant number of competitors offering similar products 
the company competes by emphasizing its ability to deliver compelling value products 
in executing this strategy  the company has two significant classes of competitors 
first  the company competes with numerous small and medium sized office furniture manufacturers that focus on more limited product lines and or end user segments and include global furniture inc  anderson hickey co  globe business furniture and united chair  inc  divisions of haworth  inc  national office furniture  a division of kimball office furniture co  and high point furniture industries  inc second  the company competes with a small number of large office furniture manufacturers which control a substantial portion of the market share in the project oriented office furniture market  such as steelcase inc  haworth  inc  herman miller  inc and knoll  inc 
some of these large competitors have substantially greater assets  resources and capabilities in the traditional project market than the company 
products and brands offered by these project oriented office furniture market participants have strong acceptance in the market place  and have developed and may continue to develop value priced product designs to compete with the company 
the company also faces significant price competition from its competitors and may encounter competition from new market entrants 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in its markets in the future 
hearth products  consisting of prefabricated metal fireplaces and related products  are manufactured by a number of national and regional competitors 
a limited number of manufacturers  however  are predominant in this relatively small industry 
both office furniture and hearth products compete on the basis of price  product performance  product quality  complete and on time delivery to the customer and customer service and support 
the company believes that it competes principally by providing compelling value products designed to be among the best in their price range for product quality and performance  superior customer service and short lead times 
this is made possible  in part  by the company s significant on going investment in product development  highly efficient and low cost manufacturing operations  and an extensive distribution network 
the company is one of the largest office furniture manufacturers in the united states  and believes that it is the largest manufacturer of value priced furniture 
the company is also the largest manufacturer and marketer of fireplaces in the united states 
for further discussion of the company s competitive situation  refer to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
effects of inflation 
certain business costs may  from time to time  increase at a rate exceeding the general rate of inflation 
the company s objective is to offset the effect of inflation on its costs primarily through productivity increases in combination with certain adjustments to the selling price of its products as competitive market and general economic conditions permit 
investments are routinely made in modern plants  equipment  support systems  and for rapid continuous improvement programs 
these investments collectively focus on increasing productivity which helps to offset the effect of rising material and labor costs 
ongoing cost control disciplines are also routinely employed 
in addition  the last in  first out lifo valuation method is used for most of the company s inventories  which ensures the changing material and labor costs are recognized in reported income  and more importantly  these costs are recognized in pricing decisions 
environmental 
the company is subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water  the handling  storage  and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials  and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances 
although the company believes it is in material compliance with all of the various regulations applicable to its business  there can be no assurance that requirements will not change in the future or that the company will not incur material cost to comply with such regulations 
the company has trained staff responsible for monitoring compliance with environmental  health  and safety requirements 
the company s environmental professionals work with responsible personnel at each manufacturing facility  the company s environmental legal counsel  and consultants on the management of environmental  health  and safety issues 
the company s ultimate goal is to reduce  and wherever practical  eliminate the creation of hazardous waste in its manufacturing processes 
compliance with federal  state  and local environmental regulations has not had a material effect on the capital expenditures  earnings  or competitive position of the company to date 
the company does not anticipate that financially material capital expenditures will be required during fiscal year for environmental control facilities 
it is management s judgment that compliance with current regulations should not have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
however  the uncertainty of new environmental legislation and technology in this area makes it impossible to know with confidence 
for further information regarding the company s environmental matters  refer to item legal proceedings  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and the contingencies note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
business development

of this total  approximately  square feet are leased 
the company also leases sales showroom space in office furniture market centers in several major metropolitan areas 
the company has a  square foot leased plant in savage  minnesota  which is in the process of being subleased 
this plant has been used for the manufacture of metal prefabricated fireplaces 
the production from this facility was consolidated with production at the company s lake city  minnesota  and calgary  alberta  canada  plants 
there are no major encumbrances on company owned properties other than outstanding mortgages on certain properties  the amount of which is disclosed in the long term debt note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  filed as a part of this report 
refer to the property  plant  and equipment note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for related cost  accumulated depreciation  and net book value data 
as of january   the company has approximately  additional square feet of production and warehousing space in various stages of construction at six existing plant sites which are scheduled for completion during item legal proceedings 
along with several other potentially responsible parties prps  the company has been involved with site investigation and clean up activities imposed by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla at one waste disposal site in georgia which allegedly received waste materials containing hazardous substances generated by the company or its subsidiaries 
in general  under cercla  each prp which actually contributes hazardous substances to a superfund site is jointly and severally liable for the costs associated with investigating and cleaning up the site 
customarily  the prps will work with the environmental protection agency epa or equivalent state agency to agree upon and implement a plan for site remediation 
prps for the georgia site have been required to institute a monitoring program  a background groundwater study  and a possible remediation work plan 
the epa has issued a record of decision for the site rod following the completion of a remedial investigation feasibility study 
the rod identified manganese  a constituent not included in waste sent by the company to the site  as the sole constituent of concern 
the company also owns a portion of the property which is part of the site 
the original property owner has agreed to repurchase the property from the company and indemnify the company against environmental liabilities arising from the company s ownership of the property 
the company also is involved in certain continuing clean up activities under the supervision of the pennsylvania state environmental authorities at one site formerly used by a company subsidiary 
the costs associated with this site are comprised primarily of remediation efforts associated with groundwater contamination 
in this matter  the company has worked with appropriate authorities to resolve the issues involved 
the company was named  along with three other prps  as a party to an imminent or substantial endangerment order and remedial action order dated april  by the california department of toxic substances control dtsc in connection with the former firestone tire rubber company facility in south gate  california firestone site 
the dtsc is seeking to cover the cost of investigating soil and groundwater contamination and preparing a remedial action plan for the firestone site 
from to  the site was owned by the firestone tire rubber company now known as bridgestone firestone  inc and operated from to primarily as a tire manufacturing facility 
the company purchased a portion of the firestone site in  and subsequently sold a portion of that property to a company now in bankruptcy proceedings 
the company continues to own a part of the firestone site 
the company believes its potential liability at the firestone site arises from the company s status as an owner of the property and not as a contributor to contamination 
the company has cooperated in the preparation of a remedial investigation feasibility study work plan ri fs work plan which was approved by dtsc in june the investigation under the ri fs work plan began in august and is expected to be completed in the company has  however  denied liability and believes that substantially all investigation and clean up costs should be borne by bridgestone firestone  inc the company also is reviewing available defenses and claims it may have against third parties  including bridgestone firestone  inc due to such factors as the wide discretion of regulatory authorities regarding clean up levels and uncertain allocation of liability at multiple party sites  estimates made prior to the approval of a formal plan of action represent management s best judgment as to estimates of reasonably foreseeable expenses based upon average remediation costs at comparable sites 
the company  therefore  has accrued liabilities reflecting management s best estimate of the eventual future cost of the company s anticipated share based upon estimated ranges of remediation costs  the existence of many other larger prps to share in such costs who are financially viable  the company s experience to date in relation to the determination of its allocable share  the volume and type of waste the company is believed to have contributed to the sites  and the anticipated periods of time over which such costs may be paid of remediation costs 
potential insurance reimbursements are not anticipated 
while the final resolution of these contingencies could result in expenses in excess of current accruals and  therefore  have an impact on the company s consolidated financial result in a future reporting period  management believes that the ultimate outcome will not have a material effect on the company s financial position or operations
