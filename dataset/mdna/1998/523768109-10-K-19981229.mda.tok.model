year the year issue concerns the inability of information technology it systems and equipment utilizing microprocessors to recognize and process date sensitive information after due to the use of only the last two digits to refer to a year 
this problem could affect both computer software and hardware and other equipment that relies on microprocessors 
management has completed a company wide evaluation of this impact on its it systems 
evaluation of date sensitive publishing equipment is expected to be complete by december  with the evaluation of broadcasting equipment expected to be complete by march  renovation and testing have been completed on all significant it systems that utilize company developed software that were not year compliant with the exception of the newspaper advertising system 
that system has been renovated and is currently being tested 
installation of the renovated advertising system is scheduled to be complete by january  the company has received representations that significant software developed by others is year compliant 
testing of these systems is expected to be complete by march  installation of a new year compliant financial system is approximately complete and is planned to be complete by july  testing of computer hardware for it systems is approximately complete 
renovation efforts and testing of systems equipment are expected to be complete by june  the company will monitor the progress of material vendors and suppliers whose uninterrupted delivery of product or service is material to the production or distribution of our print and broadcast products in their efforts to become year compliant

total costs to address year issues for it systems are currently estimated to be less than  and consist primarily of staff and consultant costs 
year remediation will require the replacement of telephone switches and software at a cost of  to  through september  approximately  had been spent for new telephone equipment 
an estimate of the cost of replacement of newspaper and broadcasting equipment will be available after the completion of the evaluations described above 
funds for these costs are expected to be provided by the operating cash flows or bank line of credit of the company 
the company could be faced with severe consequences if year issues are not identified and resolved in a timely manner by the company and material third parties 
a worst case scenario would result in the short term inability of the company to produce distribute newspapers or broadcast television programming due to unresolved year issues 
this would result in lost revenues  however  the amount would be dependent on the length and nature of the disruption  which cannot be predicted or estimated 
in light of the possible consequences  the company is devoting the resources needed to address year issues in a timely manner 
management monitors the progress of the company s year efforts and provides update reports to the audit committee of the board of directors at each meeting 
while management expects a successful resolution of these issues  there can be no guarantee that material third parties  on which the company relies  will address all year issues on a timely basis or that their failure to successfully address all issues would not have an adverse effect on the company 
the company is in the process of reviewing its existing contingency plans in case business interruptions do occur 
management expects the review of these plans to be complete by june  quarterly results the company s largest source of publishing revenue  local run of press advertising  is seasonal and tends to fluctuate with retail sales in markets served 
historically  local run of press advertising is higher in the first and third quarters
