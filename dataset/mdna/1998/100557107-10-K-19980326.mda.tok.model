item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview effective in fiscal  the company changed its fiscal year to end on the last saturday in december 
the impact on and of three and two fewer days of operations  respectively  was not material 
the company prices its beers at a premium compared to domestic mass produced beers but at a level consistent with others in the better beer category 
the company believes that this pricing is appropriate given the quality and reputation of its core products 
the company expects that its pricing may become subject to change as sales volume and competition increase  however  such expectations have not been realized in a material way 
the company s gross profit may be affected by the company s product mix  packaging and brewing location 
seasonal beers tend to be more expensive to produce and the additional expenses may not be fully offset by increased pricing 
increases in sales of seasonal beers  therefore  may reduce the company s gross profit per barrel in certain quarters 
the company sells its products in bottles and kegs 
the ratio of kegs to cases has increased in its core business excluding sales of the cincinnati brewery to others 
a shift toward a higher proportion of keg sales versus bottle sales may not have a negative impact on profit due to the fact that while kegs generate lower revenue per barrel  there is generally a corresponding reduction in the cost of producing keg products 
however  it does reduce the revenue realized per barrel 
an increase in sales of the pack package in has also reduced the revenue realized per case without a corresponding reduction in cost of goods sold 
the financial statements of the company for the periods prior to the recapitalization do not include a provision for income taxes 
prior to the recapitalization  the company operated solely as boston beer company limited partnership 
as a partnership  the income of the company was included in the income tax returns of the partnership s partners 
for information purposes  the statements of income include a pro forma income tax provision on taxable income for financial statement purposes using the effective federal and state rates that would have resulted if the partnership had filed corporate tax returns during those periods 
the company had historically distributed between and of pre tax income to its partners for the purpose of funding their tax obligations 
tax payments by the company following the recapitalization  therefore  have not caused a material change to the company s cash flow or liquidity 
effective march   the company acquired all of the equipment and other brewery related personal property of an independent brewing company located in cincinnati  ohio 
the cincinnati brewery is currently owned and managed by the samuel adams brewery company  ltd  a wholly owned affiliate of the company 
the results of operations of the samuel adams brewery company  ltd  since the date of acquisition  are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
primarily because the sales revenue per barrel sold by the cincinnati brewery to outsiders is much lower than the comparable revenue of the core business  net sales per barrel and net sales per employee are lower in fiscal than in fiscal quarterly results the company has historically experienced  and expects to continue experiencing quarterly fluctuations in its sales  operating income and net income 
the company s sales also historically tend to be lower in the first quarter of each year 
sales tend to increase in the third and fourth quarters  while decreasing in the month of december 
however  over the last two years  the second quarter has been the strongest quarter for sales 
the company has also historically expended less on advertising  promotion  and selling expenses in the first quarter 
quarterly sales and quarterly spending on advertising  promotion  and selling expenses are shown in the following table which sets forth certain unaudited quarterly results of operations for each of the eight quarters ended december  in management s opinion  this unaudited information includes all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the quarters presented

certain factors affecting future operating results statements made or incorporated in this form k include a number of forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of forward looking statements include  without limitation  statements containing the words anticipates  believes  expects  intends  future and words of similar import which express management s belief  expectations  or intentions regarding the company s future performance 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements 
the company may experience significant fluctuations in future operating results  which may be caused by many factors  including  but not limited to further slowing of the growth rate of the craft brewing segment  share of market erosion due to increased competition  increased promotional expenditures versus historical spending and versus the operating plan  higher than planned costs of operating the samuel adams brewery in cincinnati  an unexpected increase in raw material or packaging costs which cannot be passed along through increased prices  slower than planned acceptance of hardcore r cider by the trade and consumer  and inability of oregon original tm beers and other samuel adams r styles to maintain historic growth rates 
many computer systems experience problems handling dates beyond the year therefore  some computer hardware and software will need to be modified prior to the year in order to remain functional 
the company is assessing both the internal readiness of its systems as well the compliance of its vendors for the handling of the year the company expects to implement successfully the systems and programming changes necessary to address year issues  and does not believe that the cost of such actions will have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
there can be no assurance  however  that there will not be a delay in  or increased costs associated with  the implementation of such changes  and the company s inability to implement such changes could have an adverse effect on future results of operations
