southeast asia economic issues a substantial portion of the company s oil and gas operations are conducted in southeast asia  and a substantial portion of its natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon production are sold there 
in recent months  southeast asia in general  and the kingdom of thailand in particular  have experienced severe economic difficulties which have been characterized by sharply reduced economic activity  illiquidity  highly volatile foreign currency exchange rates and unstable stock markets 
the government of the kingdom of thailand and other governments in the region are currently acting to address these issues 
however  the economic difficulties currently being experienced in thailand  together with the volatility of the thai baht against the us dollar  will continue to have a material impact on the company s operations in the kingdom of thailand  together with the prices that the company receives for its oil and natural gas production there 
see results of operations  income and revenue data and results of operations  operating costs and expenses  foreign currency transaction loss 
all of the company s current natural gas production from the thailand concession is committed under a long term gas sales agreement to ptt at a price denominated in thai baht which is determined in accordance with a formula that is intended to ameliorate  at least in part  any decline in the purchasing power of the thai baht against the us dollar 
see business international operations  contractual terms governing the thailand concession and business miscellaneous  sales 
although the company currently believes that ptt will honor its commitments under the gas sales agreement  a failure by ptt to honor such commitments could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s crude oil and condensate production from the thailand concession is sold on a tanker load by tanker load basis 
prices that the company receives for such production are based on world benchmark prices  which are denominated in us dollars  and are currently expected on future crude oil sales to be paid in us dollars 
see business international operations  contractual terms governing the thailand concession and related production and business miscellaneous  sales 
the company believes that the current economic difficulties in southeast asia have resulted in a decreased demand for petroleum products in the region  which has contributed to the recent general decline in crude oil and condensate prices throughout the world 
this price decline has had an adverse effect on all oil and gas companies that sell their production on the world spot markets  including the company  without regard to where their respective production is located 
year issue many computer software systems  as well as certain hardware  were structured to utilize a two digit date field meaning that they may not be able to properly recognize dates in the year this could result in significant system failures 
the company has a process in place to identify potential year problems and implement solutions 
the company has addressed the year issue in those areas where replacement systems have been installed for other business reasons 
where existing systems are expected to remain in place beyond  the company is implementing systems changes utilizing a combination of internal and external resources 
in addition  the company intends to communicate with its major suppliers and others with whom it conducts business to determine that they will be able to resolve the year issue 
while the company believes it will be able to resolve the year issue  if it is unable to complete the required systems changes or if those with whom the company conducts business are unsuccessful in implementing solutions  the year issue could have an adverse impact on the company s operations and revenues 
based upon current estimates  the company believes that it will not incur material costs during and to implement the necessary changes to existing systems 
these costs are being expensed as they are incurred
