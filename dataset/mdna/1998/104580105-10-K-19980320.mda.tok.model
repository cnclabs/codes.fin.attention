ffo  as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit and as followed by the company  represents net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization 
in computing ffo  the company does not add back to net income the amortization of costs incurred in connection with the company s financing activities or depreciation of non real estate assets  but does add back to net income significant non recurring events that materially distort the comparative measurement of company performance over time 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity

however  there can be no assurance that further acquisitions will be made or that the acquisitions that are made will be on as economically advantageous terms to the company as those made during while the public capital markets have generally been favorable for selected reits during the past few years  there can be no assurance either that the public markets will remain receptive to providing new capital to reits or that the terms upon which the company may be able to raise funds will be attractive or favorable to the company or to its share owners 
at december   the company was holding for sale one north state because the property does not fit with the company s grocery anchored community shopping center focus and the company believes  given the current strong investment sales market in downtown chicago  that it is an opportune time to sell this asset 
proceeds received from the sale of one north state would provide a significant source of capital and liquidity to the company 
management currently expects to use the net proceeds from a sale to reduce outstanding borrowings under the line of credit with the expectation that the increased borrowing capacity under the line of credit would be used to acquire additional shopping centers within the company s target market and that are more in keeping with the company s strategic focus 
proceeds received from such sale may also be applied in whole or in part to tax deferred like kind exchange acquisitions of additional properties 
there can be no assurance that a sale will be completed  or that if a sale is completed  the net proceeds will be redeployed into investments with favorable economic conditions 
year issues the company conducts its business primarily with commercial software provided by third party vendors
