the credit agreement contains customary events of default and covenants which prohibit  among other things  incurring additional indebtedness in excess of a specified amount  paying dividends  creating liens  and engaging in mergers and acquisitions without the prior consent of gecc 
the credit agreement also contains certain financial covenants relating to net worth  interest coverage and other financial ratios 
during the fiscal year ended march   the company was not in compliance with certain financial covenants relating to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  minimum tangible net worth and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  as well as a restricted payment covenant concerning the amount of treasury stock which can be purchased by the company

and to have a significant impact on the company s reporting and disclosure requirements in fiscal impact of currency exchange and inflation the company s business operations were positively affected in the amount of   and  in the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively  due to the movement of the french franc vs 
the us dollar 
prior to march   the company s sales and purchases were virtually all in us dollars or french francs 
a weakening of the french franc vis a vis the us dollar resulted in exchange rate gains for the company 
conversely  a strengthening of the french franc vis a vis the us dollar resulted in exchange rate losses for the company 
the company monitors exchange rates on a daily basis and regularly seeks to evaluate long term expectations for the french franc in order to minimize its exchange rate risk
