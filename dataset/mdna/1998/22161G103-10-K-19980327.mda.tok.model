special note certain statements set forth below under this caption constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the reform act 
see special note regarding forward looking statements for additional factors relating to such statements 
general costilla is an independent energy company engaged in the exploration  acquisition and development of oil and gas properties 
in june  costilla consummated the acquisition for a purchase price of approximately million  in june  costilla consummated the acquisition for a purchase price of approximately million and in august  costilla consummated the ballard acquisition for a purchase price of approximately million 
the company s strategy is to utilize its technical staff and technological advances to increase its oil and gas reserves  production and cash flow from operations through an active exploration program and the acquisition and development of proved reserves 
in addition  costilla continues to evaluate the acquisition of undeveloped acreage for its exploration efforts 
costilla has in house exploration expertise using d seismic technology to identify new drilling opportunities as well as for the development of acquired properties 
the company has grown primarily through acquisitions which impacted its reported financial results in a number of ways 
properties sold by others frequently have not received focused attention prior to sale 
after acquisition  certain of these properties are in need of maintenance  workovers  recompletions and other remedial activity not constituting capital expenditures  which substantially increase lease operating expenses 
the increased production and revenue resulting from these expenditures is predominately realized in periods subsequent to the period of expense 
in addition  the rapid growth of the company has required it to develop operating  accounting and administrative personnel compatible with its increased size 
the company believes it has now achieved a sufficient size to expand its reserve base without a corresponding increase in its general and administrative expense 
the company also believes it now has a sufficient inventory of prospects and the professional staff necessary to follow a more balanced program of exploration and development activities to complement its acquisition efforts 
the company has shown a significant increase in its oil and gas reserves and production  especially due to its acquisitions from through the following table sets forth certain operating data of costilla for the periods presented year ended december  oil and gas production oil mbbls   gas mmcf    mboe    average sales prices oil per bbl gas per mcf production cost per boe per dollar of sales depreciation  depletion and amortization per boe per dollar of sales before deduction of production taxes and net of any hedging results 
production cost includes lease operating expenses and production and ad valorem taxes  if applicable  and excludes depreciation  depletion and amortization 
costilla uses the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas activities 
costs to acquire mineral interests in oil and gas properties  to drill and equip exploratory wells that result in proved reserves  and to drill and equip development wells are capitalized 
costs to drill exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves  geological  geophysical and seismic costs  and costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties are expensed 
capitalized costs of producing oil and gas properties  after considering estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs and estimated salvage values  are depreciated and depleted using the unit of production method 
unproved oil and gas properties that are individually significant are periodically reviewed for impairment of value  and a loss is recognized at the time of impairment by providing an impairment allowance 
other unproved properties are amortized based on the company s experience of successful drilling and average holding period 
the company utilizes option contracts to hedge the effect of price changes on a portion of its future oil and gas production 
premiums paid and amounts receivable under the option contracts are amortized and accrued to oil and gas sales  respectively 
if market prices of oil and gas exceed the strike price of put options  the options will expire unexercised  therefore  reducing the effective price received for oil and gas sales by the cost of the related option 
conversely  if market prices of oil and gas decline below the strike price of put options  the options will be exercised  therefore  increasing the effective price received for oil and gas sales by the proceeds received from the related option 
if market prices of oil and gas exceed the strike price of call options  the company is obligated to pay the contracting counterparty an amount equal to the contracted volumes times the difference between the market price and the strike price  therefore  reducing the effective price received for oil and gas sales by the amount paid to the counterparty 
the net effect of the company s commodity hedging activities reduced oil and gas revenues by   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company has purchased put options on  bbls of oil per day which establish a floor price of per bbl and sold call options on  bbls of oil per day at per bbl 
these oil option contracts continue through august the referenced oil prices are based upon the price at which west texas intermediate crude oil wti trades on the new york mercantile exchange nymex 
the company has historically received a gross wellhead sales price for oil of approximately of the nymex price 
the company has also purchased put options on  mmbtu of gas per day which provide for a floor of per mmbtu through october additionally  the company has purchased put options on  mmbtu of gas per day which establish a floor price of per mmbtu and sold call options on  mmbtu of gas per day at per mmbtu 
these gas option contracts are for the period april through october the referenced gas prices are based upon the index price for houston ship channel gas sales  which is approximately of nymex 
the company has historically received a gross wellhead sales price for gas of approximately of nymex 
the company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to reduce the potential impact of increases in interest rates on floating rate  long term debt 
if market rates of interest experienced during the applicable swap term are below the rate of interest effectively fixed by the swap agreement  the rate of interest incurred by the company will exceed the rate that would have been experienced under its then outstanding floating rate indebtedness 
the net effect of the company s interest rate hedging activities decreased interest expense by approximately  for the year ended december  the net effect of the company s interest rate hedging activities increased interest expense by approximately  for the year ended december  concurrent with the payment of all of the company s floating rate debt from proceeds of the initial public offering and the notes offering consummated in the fourth quarter of  the interest rate swap agreements ceased to qualify as hedges 
these interest rate swap agreements were marked to market and the related liability of  was recorded 
a million interest rate swap expired in may as a result of the company s borrowings against its line of credit  which bears interest on a floating rate basis  the remaining million interest rate swap agreement again qualified as a hedge beginning in august at each borrowing date from october to august  a portion of the interest rate swap agreement was marked to market with the resulting gains or losses recorded as investment income or loss while the hedge portion is being amortized over the remaining life of the agreement 
as a result of expiration and marking the agreements to market  the company recorded a net investment gain of approximately  during the year ended december  concurrent with the payment of all of the company s floating rate debt from proceeds of the notes offering in january  the interest rate swap agreement ceased to qualify as a hedge 
as a result of marking to market the interest rate swap agreement in january  the company recorded an additional liability of approximately  the company s predecessor was classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
therefore  no income taxes were paid or provided by the company prior to the company s ipo and the offering of the existing notes 
future tax amounts  if any  will be dependent upon several factors  including but not limited to the company s results of operations 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the company s total oil and gas revenues for the year ended december  were  representing an increase of  over revenues of  in this increase was primarily due to successful drilling activities and the acquisition  which accounted for approximately  and  of increased revenue  respectively 
the ballard acquisition accounted for approximately  of the increase 
gas imbalances accounted for approximately  of the increase  with an average price of per mcf 
approximately of the gas imbalance relates to production in prior periods against which a valuation allowance had been recorded due to uncertainty of ultimate collection 
during the year ended december   uncertainties related to these imbalances were substantially reduced and the related valuation allowance reversed 
management does not expect similar effects from gas imbalances in future periods 
these increases were partially offset by the  net effect of lower commodity prices 
the average oil price per barrel received in was compared to in  an decrease  and the average gas price received in was compared to in  a increase 
the sale of certain properties in april and december  also partially offset the increased revenues in the amount of  oil and gas production was  mboe in compared to  mboe in  a increase 
of the  mboe increase  approximately mboe was due to successful drilling activities and mboe was due to the properties acquired in the acquisition 
gas imbalances accounted for approximately mboe of the increase 
the ballard acquisition properties accounted for approximately mboe of the increase 
the sale of certain properties in april and december partially offset the increased production volumes 
interest and other revenues were  for the year ended december  compared to  in  representing an increase of  of this increase   was related to increased interest income due to increased funds earning interest 
gains on investment transactions of  were recorded for the year ended december  related to an interest rate swap contract which was marked to market 
in the year ended december  losses of  were recognized on certain investment transactions 
during  losses of  related to an oil collar which was marked to market 
no comparable transactions existed in other income was  for the year ended december  compared to  for  representing an increase of  
gains from the sale of certain oil and gas properties increased by approximately  the remainder of the increase was due primarily to a gain of approximately  recognized on the sale of the company s interest in a partnership which owned the independence plaza building in midland  texas 
oil and gas production costs for the year ended december  were  per boe  compared to  in per boe  representing an increase of   with approximately  of the increase relating to the acquisition and  to successful drilling activities 
the remainder of the increase was due primarily to increased treating and transportation costs due to increased gas production and  to a lesser extent  the ballard acquisition  offset in part by the sale of certain high operating cost properties in april on a per boe basis  production costs decreased due to a combination of the sale of certain high operating cost properties in april  the gas imbalance volumes and lower production costs on newly completed wells 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  representing an increase of  from of  the increase is primarily due to additional personnel and related costs necessary to accommodate the acceleration of the company s oil and gas activities  the ballard acquisition  increased insurance costs and other costs for a full twelve month period related to becoming a public company in october  exploration and abandonment expense increased to  for the year ended december  compared to  in the company incurred  of seismic costs for the year ended december   compared to  in dry hole and abandonment costs increased to  in from  in the company incurred  of other geological and geophysical costs during the year ended december   compared to  in the increase in exploration and abandonments expense was primarily related to the company s increased drilling activities in compared to a very low level of activity in d d a expense for the year ended december  was  compared to  for  representing an increase of  
during the period  d d a on oil and gas production was provided at an average rate of per boe compared to per boe for approximately  of this increase was due to successful drilling activities   related to the acquisition and an additional  of the increase was due to the recording of gas imbalances 
the remainder of the increase was due primarily to the effect of lower oil and gas prices at december  than those experienced at december  impairment of oil and gas properties for the year ended december  was  no comparable expense was recorded in this impairment expense was determined under the guidelines of fas impairment of long lived assets using estimates of net undiscounted cash flow and estimated present values for the company s oil and gas reserves based upon the non escalated prices used in the company s december  reserve report 
interest expense was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the comparable period in the  increase was attributable primarily to increased levels of debt offset in part by a decrease in the effective interest rate 
the average amounts of applicable interest bearing debt in and were  and  respectively 
the effective annualized interest rate in was  as compared to in results of operations for the year ended december  include an extraordinary charge of  compared to  for the comparable period in these extraordinary charges related to the early extinguishment of the company s prior bank credit facilities and consisted of the unamortized balance of previously capitalized debt issuance costs 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the company s total oil and gas revenues for the year ended december  were  representing an increase of  over revenues of  in this increase was primarily due to the acquisition and acquisition  which accounted for approximately  and  of the revenue increase  respectively 
the remainder of the increase was due to a combination of increased product prices  successful drilling activities and the enhancement of existing production 
the average oil price per barrel received in was compared to in  a increase  and the average gas price per mcf received in was compared to in  a increase 
oil and gas production was  mboe in compared to  mboe in  an increase of 
of the  mboe increase  approximately mboe was due to the properties acquired in the acquisition and mboe was due to the properties acquired in the acquisition  in each case including enhancements of production after such acquisition 
the remainder of the increase was due to a combination of successful drilling activities and the enhancement of existing production 
interest and other revenues were  for the year ended december  compared to  in  representing a decrease of  which was primarily comprised of  in losses on investments held for trading purposes and an increase in interest income of  in due to increased funds earning interest 
also in  the company realized gains of  on various transactions for which no comparable sales were recorded in oil and gas production costs in were  per boe  compared to  in per boe  representing an increase of   due principally to the acquisition and to a lesser extent the acquisition 
on a per boe basis  production costs increased due primarily to higher production costs per boe for the properties acquired in the acquisition 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  representing an increase of  from of  the increase is primarily due to an increase in personnel and related costs necessary to accommodate the increased activities of the company due to the and acquisitions 
however  as noted above  production volumes increased and  therefore  general and administrative expenses per boe decreased to per boe for the year ended december  from the per boe in results of operations for the year ended december  include non cash compensation expense of  deemed to have been received by a minority interest owner of the company who was deemed to have benefited from the cancellation of an option to purchase an additional interest held by the other minority interest owner 
exploration and abandonment expense increased to  in compared to  in the company incurred  of seismic costs for the year ended december   compared to  which were incurred in dry hole and abandonment costs increased to  in from  in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense for was  compared to  for  representing an increase of  
during  depreciation  depletion and amortization on oil and gas production was provided at an average rate of per boe compared to per boe for the increases were due primarily to the and acquisitions 
interest expense was  in  compared to  in the  increase was attributable primarily to increased levels of debt which the company used to finance the acquisition and amortization of financing costs 
the average amounts of applicable interest bearing debt in and were  and  respectively 
the effective annualized interest rate in was  as compared to in results of operations for the year ended december  include an extraordinary charge of  net of the related deferred tax benefit of  related to the early extinguishment of the company s prior bank credit facilities the credit facility and the bridge facility 
the credit facility was replaced by the bridge facility in june and the bridge facility was paid off with proceeds from the ipo and the sale of the existing notes in october liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities increased to million from million for the corresponding period in cash provided by operations  before changes in operating assets and liabilities  increased to million from million for the comparable period in due primarily to the ballard acquisition  the acquisition and the increase in results of operations therefrom 
net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million 
approximately million was used for the ballard acquisition  million was used for other oil and gas expenditures and million was used for other property and equipment 
during the year ended december   approximately million net cash was provided by sales of oil and gas properties 
for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was million 
approximately million was used for the acquisition  million for additional acquisition of producing oil and gas properties and exploration and development activities and million primarily for other property and equipment 
during that period  approximately million net cash was provided by sales of oil and gas properties 
financing activities for the year ended december   the company incurred million of debt  of which approximately million was used to repay certain prior bank debt  million was used for the ballard acquisition and the remainder was used in connection with its exploration and development activities 
in addition  the company used approximately million for the purchase of  shares of its common stock 
the company entered into a million senior credit agreement in june  which was fully funded prior to the company s initial public offering in october approximately million was used for the extension and refinancing of prior debt  million was used for the acquisition and approximately million was used for general corporate purposes 
in october  this senior credit facility was paid with the proceeds from the initial public offering and an offering of senior notes  and the company entered into a new million credit agreement 
approximately million was outstanding under this senior credit facility prior to its refinancing in august the company replaced the above described senior credit facility with the revolving credit facility in august approximately million was used for the extension and refinancing of the prior senior credit facility and million was used as a portion of the purchase price in the ballard acquisition 
the revolving credit facility provides for a maximum availability of million  with an initial borrowing base of million 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest  at the company s option  at a floating rate which is at or above the lender s prime rate or above the applicable eurodollar rate  depending on the percentage of committed funds which have been borrowed 
interest is payable quarterly as to base rate loans  and at the end of the applicable interest period as to eurodollar rate loans 
the borrowing base of the revolving credit facility is automatically reduced by each quarter beginning in august  and payments of principal are required in each such quarter in which the outstanding principal balance is greater than the reduced borrowing base 
the remaining balance is payable on august   the maturity date of the revolving credit facility 
in connection with the sale of certain oil and gas properties on december  for proceeds of million  the borrowing base was reduced to million  of which was borrowed at december  contemporaneous with entering into the revolving credit facility  the company also entered into the acquisition credit facility to provide the remaining financing for the ballard acquisition 
the acquisition credit facility was a term loan in the amount of million which was repaid in full in connection with the sale of notes by the company described in the following paragraph 
in january the company issued million of senior notes due the supplemental notes offering 
the net proceeds of the supplemental notes offering were approximately million 
the company used million to repay the acquisition credit facility and million to repay all but million of the revolving credit facility 
in mid january approximately million of the remaining proceeds were used to fund the manti acquisition 
capital resources funding for the company s business activities has historically been provided by bank financings  cash flow from operations  equity sales  property divestitures and joint ventures with industry participants 
the acquisition  acquisition and ballard acquisition were substantially funded by bank financings 
the company plans to execute its business strategy with cash flow from operations  net proceeds from the supplemental notes offering and borrowings available under the revolving credit facility 
while the company regularly engages in discussions relating to potential acquisitions  the company has no present agreement  commitment or understanding with respect to any such acquisition  other than the acquisition of undeveloped acreage and various mineral interests in its normal course of business 
any future acquisition may require additional financing and will be dependent upon financing arrangements available at the time 
the company believes that the increased availability under the revolving credit facility resulting from the application of net proceeds of the supplemental notes offering  the remaining net proceeds from the supplemental notes offering and cash flow from operations will be sufficient for its budgeted capital expenditures 
however  because the company s ultimate capital expenditures  future cash flows and the availability of financing are subject to a number of variables  there can be no assurance that the company s capital resources will be sufficient to maintain its capital expenditures 
in addition  if the company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service its debt  it may be required to refinance all or a portion of its debt or to obtain additional financing 
there can be no assurance that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained 
although certain of the company s costs and expenses may be affected by inflation  inflationary costs have not had a significant effect on the company s results of operations 
since december  oil and gas prices have continued to deteriorate 
the company estimates that its cash flow would be reduced by million and million for each per barrel reduction in the price of oil and for each per mcf reduction in the price of gas  respectively 
capital expenditures the company originally announced a capital budget of approximately million of which approximately million was budgeted for the acquisition of undeveloped acreage  seismic and exploitation activities 
given the current low level of oil prices and its extensive undeveloped acreage and seismic inventory  the company has elected to temporarily defer non drilling activities pending an improvement in oil prices 
in addition  the company intends to concentrate its drilling activities on gas prospects 
since a significant portion of the company s capital budget is discretionary  the company is able to increase or decrease its level of activity as product prices warrant 
recent accounting pronouncements information systems for the year the company will be required to modify its information systems in order to accurately process data referencing the year because of the importance of occurrence dates in the oil and gas industry  the consequences of not pursuing these modifications could be very significant to the company s ability to manage and report operating activities 
the company s third party software vendor for its integrated oil and gas information system is currently modifying the system to accurately handle the year issue 
all necessary programming modifications are scheduled to be completed by december  from a cost viewpoint  these modifications will be part of the routine updates the company receives from its third party software vendor as part of its systems support contract already in place 
thus  the company believes it will not incur any marginal costs with respect to the year issue
