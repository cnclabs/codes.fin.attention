products fib workstations the company is a world leader in the design  manufacture and sale of fib workstations 
a fib workstation consists of a vacuum stand  ion beam focusing column  sample holder device stage  associated electronics and software and various optional enhancements 
the company s line of fib workstations includes the two inch stage model  the eight inch stage model and the dualbeam models and  which place both ion and electron beam columns on a single vacuum chamber 
sales of fib workstations accounted for approximately of the company s net sales in the company s fib workstations enable users to image  mill  cut  modify and analyze the features of samples within submicron tolerances 
the unique combination of capabilities of fib workstations allows users to perform analysis and modification with precision and speed that previously were not possible at such tolerances 
the company believes its fib workstations significantly speed and improve the functions of design edit  failure analysis and process monitoring performed by ic manufacturers  thereby shortening time to market for new generations of ics and increasing the yield of fabrication lines 
the company also believes its fib workstations can be used in other sub micron  micromachining applications  including the manufacture of thin film heads 
the following table summarizes key features of the company s line of fib workstations

the company s electron microscope products consist of a range of both transmission electron microscopes tems and scanning electron microscopes sems  as described below 
in the use of a tem  the specimen is irradiated by an electron beam which is focused onto and then passes through the specimen 
the resulting image of the internal structure of the specimen is then magnified by a series of magnetic lens fields and projected on a fluorescent screen or an imaging camera 
the specimen  in order to be transparent to an electron beam  generally should be no thicker than approximately micron the required sample preparation is usually an involved and lengthy process  however  in many cases  tems are the only tool available to reveal sub nanometer one billionth of a meter features 
in some cases  fib instruments may be used to mill and prepare tem samples 
tems developed  manufactured and sold by the company are used by a broad range of hospitals  pharmaceutical laboratories  university and government biological research centers  materials science laboratories and semiconductor research laboratories 
a market for tem use in process development and process monitoring in the ic industry has begun to develop 
unlike the tem  which produces images by passing electrons through a very thin specimen  a sem provides images of a specimen above one nanometer by scanning the electron beam over the surface of the specimen 
sems developed  manufactured and sold by the company are used by a broad range of hospitals  pharmaceutical laboratories  university and government biological research centers  materials science laboratories  semiconductor research laboratories as well as in manufacturing processes of ic manufacturers 
in addition to high magnification imaging  sems are used to gather other specimen information  such as elemental composition 
the company s xl series of sems  introduced in  has a user friendly windows based interface 
the company believes the xl series was the first sem to implement this technology fully and its introduction allowed philips electron optics business to strengthen its position in the sem market 
the xl series has been further improved through advancements in specimen handling capabilities and improved image resolution to satisfy a greater and more demanding range of applications 
the following tables summarize key features of the company s lines of tems and sems 
tems model first shipped features em kv tem provides high contrast imaging and enhanced ease of use cm kv tem  designed for life science applications  provides high contrast images  with flexible recording media  complete computerized documentation and specimen protection cm kv tem combines ergonomic user interface for simple  secure operations  optimal optical performance and specimen protection cm cm with dedicated microscope for high biotwin contrast imaging of life science specimens at liquid nitrogen temperatures cm cm biotwin with energy filter and image bio filter processing software to enhance life science specimen protection cm kv tem stem system  designed for materials science applications  provides ultra high resolution to permit visualization and characterization of crystal structures  microstructures  composition  defects and interfaces at atomic level cm cm with field emission source provides feg ultra high resolution in tem stem imaging  diffracting microanalysis and scanning cm kv tem with greater penetration and resolution capacity than cm cm cm with field emission source provides feg resolution to angstrom level xl general purpose x millimeter stage sem xls xl with field emission source for feg examination of uncoated specimens at low kv and high magnification sems model first shipped features xlcp xl with controlled pressure  permitting specimen vacuum up to torr xl top xl plug and play requiring mains connection only xl xl with secondary electron imaging at a esem wide range of accurately controlled high chamber pressures mbar or more  which reduces charge effects and prevents desiccation of wet specimens xl xl with field emission source and gaseous esem secondary electron detector system feg xl general purpose inch wafer sem xl feg xl with field emission source for examination of large samples  from semiconductors to advanced materials such as ceramics and coated metals  featuring flexible port configuration xl sem with inch stage  provides fully digital control and wafer navigation using the hexalens electron column for high resolution imaging at low beam energies xl expected xl with robotic handling of wafer cassettes for defect review and wafer inspection in the fab emitters the company is a world leader in ion and electron emitter research and manufacture 
the company manufactures both ion and electron emitters with a variety of technical features to meet the needs of its customers 
sales of emitters accounted for approximately of the company s net sales in the company believes its emitters are characterized by a relatively long useful life and provide a mechanically stable  high brightness beam 
the useful life of an emitter is limited by the natural loss of emitter material during the emission process and varies  depending on the type of emitter and customer use 
the company s current ion emitter has a source life of approximately  hours 
the company sells its electron emitters primarily to manufacturers of electron beam equipment and to scientific research facilities  as well as using them in its tem  sem and dualbeam systems 
the company sells its ion emitters primarily to research and scientific facilities and incorporates them in its ion focusing columns and fib workstations 
the prices of the company s emitters generally range from to  the company also manufactures single crystal electron source rods and wire  which it sells to researchers and to emitter manufacturers for use in electron emitter fabrication and other research applications 
focusing columns the company is a market leader in focusing column technology 
the company manufactures a variety of focusing columns  including single lens electron columns and two lens electron and ion columns that incorporate an electronically variable aperture 
sales of focusing columns to third party customers for on a pro forma combined basis were  or approximately of net sales 
the company recently introduced for use in its fib workstations a magnum ion focusing column  which provides resolution within less than microns nanometers  and a high current density that provides improved milling performance while maintaining a resolution accuracy among the highest in the industry 
the company sells electron beam columns primarily to sem manufacturers and sells ion beam columns primarily to manufacturers of surface analysis systems and other ion beam systems  as well as to research and scientific facilities 
for specialty uses  the company manufactures customized focusing columns to purchaser specifications 
columns manufactured for sale as stand alone products are packaged as compact units on standard flanges 
these columns can be adapted to existing microscopy  lithography and other systems to supplement the capabilities of those systems 
research and development the company s research and development staff at december  consisted of employees  including scientists  engineers  designer draftsmen and technicians 
the company also contracts with philips research laboratories for basic research applicable to the company s electron optics product line 
the company believes its knowledge of field emission technology and products incorporating focused ion beams is critical to its past and future performance in the focused charged particle beam business 
in developing new field emission based products  the company has been able to combine its own experience since formation in with a number of outside resources 
drawing on these resources  the company has developed a number of product innovations  including the enhanced etch process to remove metals  insulators and carbon based materials quickly and accurately during ion milling and to heighten surface contrast for electron imaging  simsmap for visual display of chemical and elemental analysis  a rigid stacked disk focusing column for greater beam control  a process for deposition of insulating layers in ic modification and enhanced processes for wafer mapping and coordination between fib tools and cad navigational software 
the peo operations  which the company acquired in the combination  introduced its first tem in and has continued to be a leader in the design  manufacture and sale of tems and sems 
the company has recently developed kv and kv tems  which can provide atomic resolution imaging for materials science applications  as well as kv tems with integrated atomic element mapping for life sciences applications 
the company s sems are user friendly  and have used a windows based user interface since the company s latest sems incorporate its new electron column which provides extremely high image resolution at low voltages  and its environmental sems esems provide superior resolution at low vacuum pressure 
from time to time the company engages in joint research and development projects with certain of its customers and other parties 
electron microscope development is conducted in collaboration with universities and research institutions  often supported by european community research and development programs 
in the company received public funds under dutch government and european community funded research and development programs  the most significant of which is the micro electronics development for european applications medea program  which was established in the company also maintains other informal collaborative relationships with universities and other research institutions and the company works with several of its customers for evaluation of new products 
the semiconductor manufacturing market and other markets into which the company sells its principal products are subject to rapid technological development  product innovation and competitive pressures 
consequently  the company has expended substantial amounts on research and development  and it generally intends to continue at or above its present level of research and development expenditures 
research and development expenses for were million and on a pro forma combined basis would have been million  or approximately of net sales 
manufacturing the company has manufacturing operations located in hillsboro  oregon  eindhoven  the netherlands  and brno  czech republic 
the company s fib workstation manufacturing operations consist of fabricating components  testing components and subassemblies from eindhoven and assembling and testing finished products 
the company s electron microscope manufacturing operations consist primarily of the assembly of electronic and mechanical modules and final assembly and testing of systems to meet customer specifications 
orders are executed using an integrated logistics automation system which controls the flow of goods 
the company also fabricates electron and ion source materials and manufactures electron and ion emitters and columns at its facilities in oregon 
the company s production schedule for its systems products is generally based on a combination of sales forecasts and the receipt of specific customer orders 
all components  subassemblies and finished products are inspected for compliance with company and customer specifications 
following assembly  all products are shipped in custom protective packaging to prevent damage during shipment 
although many of the components and subassemblies included in the company s system products are standard products  a significant portion of the mechanical parts and subassemblies are custom made by one or two suppliers  including philips machinefabrieken bv philips machine shop  located in eindhoven 
the company believes some of the components supplied to it are available to the suppliers only from single sources 
those parts subject to single or limited source supply are monitored by the company to ensure that adequate sources are available to maintain manufacturing schedules 
although the company believes it would be able to develop alternate sources for any of the components used in its products  significant delays or interruptions in the delivery of components from suppliers or difficulties or delays in shifting manufacturing capacity to new suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the company 
sales and marketing the company s sales and marketing staff at december  consisted of approximately employees  including direct salespersons  applications specialists and technical writers 
applications specialists identify and develop new applications for the company s products  which the company believes will further expand its fib workstation and electron microscope markets 
products manufactured by the company are sold in canada  france  germany  italy  japan  the netherlands  the united kingdom and the united states through wholly owned sales and service subsidiaries of the company  and elsewhere in the world through philips affiliated agents distributors and through independent agents distributors 
the company s fib workstations and columns are sold generally with a month warranty  and warranty periods have typically been shorter for used workstations 
the company s fib workstations are generally covered by service contracts after expiration of any warranty 
the company employs fib workstation engineers in the united states  in europe and in southeast asia 
the company also contracts with independent service representatives for fib workstation service in japan  israel  south korea  taiwan and singapore  and the company expects to add additional service engineers in other locations as needed 
the company s electron optics products typically have a month warranty and are generally covered by service contracts at the end of the warranty period 
service contracts are specific to customer requirements  but typically cover parts  materials and labor and include one routine maintenance per year 
due to a shift in sales towards the ic manufacturing market  which generally has higher demands for responsiveness and hour support  the company anticipates further increasing its investment in service and support activities for its electron microscope business 
the company uses sales type leases to enhance the affordability of its fib workstations 
as of december   the company had six lease contracts for fib workstations  with an aggregate outstanding balance of approximately million 
the company anticipates using third party leasing for future sales that require purchaser financing 
international sales defined as sales outside the united states were of net sales in international sales are expected to continue to represent a significant percentage of net sales for the company 
certain risks are inherent in international operations  including changes in demand resulting from fluctuations in interest and exchange rates  the risk of government financed competition  changes in trade policies  tariff regulations and difficulties in obtaining export licenses 
in addition  a substantial portion of the company s international sales are denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
consequently  a decrease in the value of a relevant foreign currency in relation to the us dollar occurring after agreement on price and before receipt of payment would have an adverse impact on results of operations 
the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on the results of operations of the company cannot be accurately predicted 
the company is establishing a hedging program for foreign currency exposure  but there is no assurance that any hedging techniques will eliminate the effects of currency fluctuations 
backlog the company s backlog consists of purchase orders it has received for products it expects to ship within the next nine months 
the company s backlog at december  was million  compared with a pro forma combined backlog of million at december  the company expects to ship all products representing this backlog in  although there is no assurance the company will be able to do so 
for sales of fib workstations  advance or progress payments typically have not been received from customers unless the system ordered includes custom features 
a significant portion of the company s backlog consists of relatively high unit price products 
as a result  the timing of the receipt of an order from a single customer could have a material impact on the company s backlog at any date 
for this and other reasons  the amount of backlog at any date is not necessarily indicative of revenue in future periods 
competition the markets for sale of fib workstations  electron microscopes and related components  are highly competitive 
the company s principal competitors for the sale of fib workstations are seiko instruments inc  schlumberger technologies ate division  micrion corporation  jeol usa  inc and hitachi  ltd 
the company s principal competitors for the sale of electron microscopes are jeol  ltd  hitachi  ltd  amray inc and leo electron microscopy  inc a number of the company s competitors and potential competitors may have greater financial  marketing and production resources than the company 
additionally  these markets are rapidly changing  and one or more of the company s competitors might achieve a technological advance that would put the company at a competitive disadvantage 
the company believes the key competitive factors in the fib workstation market are performance  range of features  reliability and price 
the company believes it is competitive with respect to each of these factors 
the company has experienced price competition in the sale of its fib workstations and believes price may continue to be an important factor in the sale of most models 
intense price competition in the sale of fib workstations to strategic customers has in the past adversely affected the company s profit margins 
the principal elements of competition in the electron microscope market are the performance characteristics of the system and the cost of ownership of the system  based on purchase price and maintenance costs 
the company believes it is competitive with respect to each of these factors 
in both the tem and sem markets  the ability of the company to remain competitive will depend in part upon its success in developing new and enhanced systems and introducing these systems at competitive prices on a timely basis 
the company believes the key competitive factors in the emitter market are emitter life  brightness  stability  ease of use and price 
the company believes it competes favorably with respect to each of these factors 
although the company has relatively few competitors in the manufacture and sale of specialized electron beam and ion beam focusing columns  many of the company s customers  including certain manufacturers of electron microscopes  have the technical and other resources to manufacture focusing columns 
the company believes other key competitive factors in the focusing column business are beam performance  packaging and reliability 
the company believes it competes favorably with respect to each of these factors in the focusing column market 
in each of the company s markets  there are few barriers to entry 
given the fact that these markets are in the developmental stage  there is no assurance that other companies  including but not limited to certain of the company s customers  will not enter one or more of these markets in the future 
patents and intellectual property the company relies on a combination of trade secret protection  nondisclosure agreements and patents to establish and protect its proprietary rights 
there is no assurance  however  that any of these intellectual property rights will have commercial value or will be sufficiently broad to protect the aspect of the company s technology to which the patents relate or that competitors will not design around the patents 
the company has nine us patents and one patent application pending relating to its fib workstation business 
all of the patents used by the company relating to its electron microscope products are licensed from philips and its affiliates 
the company also has access to technology through cross licenses between philips affiliates and a large number of manufacturers in the electronics industry worldwide 
as part of its fib workstations  the company sells the software used for control of its ion and electron focusing columns and does not retain ownership rights to the software 
cad software incorporated into fib workstations is provided to the company on an oem basis 
policing unauthorized use of the company s technology is difficult  and there is no assurance that measures taken by the company to protect this technology will be successful 
although the company s competitive position may be affected by its ability to protect its proprietary information  the company believes that other factors  such as the company s years of experience in the development of charged particle emission technology  its technical expertise  its name recognition and its continuing product support and enhancement  may be more significant in maintaining the company s competitive position 
several of the company s competitors hold patents covering a variety of focused ion beam products and applications and methods of use of focused ion and electron beam products 
some of the company s customers may use the company s fib workstations for applications that are similar to those covered by these patents 
from time to time the company and its customers have received correspondence from competitors of the company claiming that certain of the company s products  as used by its customers  may be infringing one or more of these patents 
other than as described below under item legal proceedings  none of these allegations has resulted in litigation 
the company believes it has credible arguments that these patents are either invalid  not infringed or would not be enforced by a court 
the company is aware of a patent held by micrion corporation micrion which  if valid  could be infringed by the sale of the company s ion focusing columns  whether sold separately or as part of the company s fib workstations 
the patent relates to the use of certain materials in the construction of parts of an ion focusing column 
the company believes  however  that if infringement were alleged  the patent would either be construed narrowly so as not to cover products sold by the company or their use or would be invalid based upon prior art references which the company believes anticipate or render obvious those claims and based upon sales by the company of focusing columns that incorporated the patented technology more than one year prior to the patent application date 
the company has not received any allegation of infringement or any other formal communication from micrion with respect to this patent 
the company believes the ion focusing columns manufactured by all of its other competitors also use technology that could infringe the patent if valid 
to the company s knowledge  no other focusing column manufacturer has received any allegation of infringement with respect to this patent 
there is no assurance that competitors or others will not assert infringement claims against the company or its customers in the future with respect to current or future products or uses or that any such assertion may not result in costly litigation or require the company to obtain a license to intellectual property rights of others 
there is no assurance that such licenses will be available on satisfactory terms or at all 
if claims of infringement are asserted against customers of the company  those customers may seek indemnification from the company for damages or expenses they incur 
as the number and sophistication of focused ion and electron beam products in the industry increase through the continued introduction of new products by the company and others  and the functionality of these products further overlaps  manufacturers and users of ion and electron beam products may become increasingly subject to infringement claims 
employees at december   the company had approximately full time employees worldwide  including approximately in manufacturing  approximately in research and development  approximately in marketing and sales  approximately in finance  accounting and information services  approximately in customer service and approximately in administration 
many of the approximately employees of the company employed outside the us participate in collective labor agreements 
none of the company s us employees are represented by a labor union  and the company has never experienced a work stoppage  slowdown or strike 
the company believes it maintains good employee relations

the company also maintains an administrative and manufacturing facility in eindhoven  the netherlands  consisting of approximately  square meters of space leased by the company for a ten year term commencing february the lease payment for the first year was  and  assuming a constant currency exchange rate of nlg per us dollar  will be approximately  in years two through ten under the lease 
the company also maintains leased manufacturing facilities in brno  czech republic 
the company expects that its facilities will be adequate to meet its needs for the foreseeable future 
item legal proceedings in may micrion corporation micrion  a principal competitor of the company  filed a lawsuit against the company in the us district court for the district of massachusetts the court alleging infringement of a patent issued to micrion relating to the use of an electron beam to neutralize a positive charge that can develop with the use of an ion beam in a fib workstation 
the complaint also alleges that the company used information confidential to micrion to develop devices to effect charge neutralization  to incorporate such devices into the company s fib workstations  to manufacture certain ion emitters  and to persuade prospective purchasers of fib workstations to purchase workstations from the company rather than from micrion 
micrion sought an injunction against infringement of the micrion patent  damages of at least million for misuse of confidential information  treble damages for infringement of the micrion patent  attorneys fees and other damages 
the company believes it has valid defenses to micrion s claims 
the company initiated a proceeding with the american arbitration association seeking to arbitrate micrion s non patent claims 
in response to motions filed by the company in the court and the us district court for the district of oregon  micrion was ordered to arbitrate these matters in oregon  and the court action has been stayed with respect to these matters 
the company filed an answer and counterclaim in the court  asserting that the patent is not infringed and is invalid 
in may the parties dismissed the court action and the arbitration  each without prejudice 
either micrion or the company may re initiate either the court action or the arbitration 
in both micrion and the company initiated procedures to have the united states patent and trademark office the pto reexamine the validity of the micrion patent 
the pto ordered that the patent be reexamined  and the reexamination proceeding is pending 
the pto has so far rejected all the claims that it has reexamined  and micrion may attempt to overcome these rejections by argument or by amending its claims

on february  the company completed a combination transaction the combination with the electron optics business of philips industrial electronics international bv pie  a wholly owned subsidiary of philips electronics nv philips 
pursuant to the combination  the company acquired shares of two philips subsidiaries owning substantially all of the assets and liabilities of philips electron optics business the peo operations  and the company issued to pie  shares of its common stock equal  after issuance  to percent of the outstanding shares of common stock of the company 
because pie acquired control of the company by acquiring of the outstanding voting securities of the company  the combination was treated as a reverse acquisition for accounting and financial reporting purposes whereby purchase accounting was applied to the financial statements of pre combination fei 
the results of operations of pre combination fei are excluded from the consolidated financial statements prior to february  the financial statements for and earlier periods represent the results of only the peo operations 
in february the company acquired delmi sro  a czech republic company peo brno  with headquarters in brno  czech republic for  peo brno s results of operations are included in the consolidated financial statements of the company for periods after january in july the company acquired substantially all of the assets of electroscan corporation  a massachusetts corporation electroscan  for million 
electroscan s results of operations are included in the company s consolidated financial statements for periods after june the company s products include focused ion beam fib workstations  transmission electron microscopes tems  scanning electron microscopes sems and components of these products 
the company s fib workstations are sold primarily to manufacturers of integrated circuits ics and are used in the design  failure analysis and process monitoring of ics 
the company s electron microscope products are sold primarily to life science and materials science research institutes  universities and industrial customers  as well as to ic manufacturers 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain unaudited financial data for the periods indicated as a percentage of net sales 
year ended december  combined peo operations company net sales fib workstations electron microscopes components service total net sales cost of sales gross profit total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense income loss before taxes income tax expense net income loss years ended december  and combined company operations compared to peo operations net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  increased million compared to the year ended december  the increase in sales is primarily attributable to the fact that the period includes net sales of the combined company  and the period includes net sales of the peo operations only 
pre combination fei contributed approximately million in revenue for the period from the closing of the combination on february  closing to december  sales of electron microscopes decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the period as reported 
however  a portion of the company s sales are eliminated in consolidation for the period subsequent to the combination 
before eliminations for intercompany sales  electron microscope sales increased approximately million from to sales outside the us for the combined company accounted for of sales for the year ended december  and for the peo operations for the year ended december  the decrease in percentage of international sales reflects the historically lower percentage of pre combination fei sales made outside the united states 
the company expects that sales outside the us will continue to represent a significant percentage of its net sales 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december  increased million compared to the year ended december  gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended december   increased to from for  primarily due to changes in product mix and a lower percentage of total sales attributed to the service business 
these increases in gross margin were partially offset by purchase accounting adjustments that stepped up the basis in inventory of pre combination fei at the date of the combination and obsolescence charges related to certain discontinued parts 
research and development 
research and development expense increased million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  this increase primarily reflects the fact that research and development costs for the period were those of the peo operations only  and the period costs are those of the combined company 
research and development costs of pre combination fei were million for the period from the combination through december  as a percentage of sales  research and development expense was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  this comparative decrease as a percentage of sales during was the result of increased sales volume  and the averaging effect which resulted from combining the historically lower percentage research and development expense of pre combination fei and the historically higher percentage research and development expense of the peo operations 
general  selling and administrative 
general  selling and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million compared to the year ended december  this increase primarily reflects the fact that the period included the operations of the combined company  and the period included the operations of only the peo operations 
general  selling and administrative expenses incurred by pre combination fei were million for the period from the combination through december  general  selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were and for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the increase in these expenses as a percentage of sales in compared to resulted primarily from the higher costs incurred as a separate publicly reporting entity compared to the peo operations expenses as a business unit within philips 
amortization of intangibles 
purchase accounting for the combination as of february  resulted in the recognition of intangible assets in the amount of million for existing technology that is being amortized over a year period  and goodwill of million that is being amortized over a year period 
purchased in process research and development 
purchase accounting for the combination as of february  resulted in the recognition of an intangible asset in the amount of million representing the estimated fair value of in process research and development at pre combination fei 
this intangible asset was written off with a charge to earnings immediately following the combination in keeping with the company s policy to expense all research and development costs as they are incurred 
restructuring and reorganization costs 
in march a charge to earnings of million was recognized in connection with the company plan to move manufacturing of certain products from massachusetts to eindhoven  the netherlands 
the charge included million for the write off of goodwill related to the company s acquisition of electroscan along with estimated severance costs for certain electroscan employees and other related costs 
other income expense 
prior to the date of the combination  the peo operations participated in philips centralized cash management program and therefore earned no interest income and incurred no interest expense 
interest income for the year ended december  represents interest earned on the investment of excess cash

income tax expense 
the effective income tax rate was and for the year ended december  and december   respectively 
the company did not record a tax benefit for the year ended december   primarily because the million of purchased in process research and development costs written off immediately subsequent to the closing were non deductible for income tax purposes 
the company s tax rates generally vary from the us federal statutory tax rate of primarily as a result of state and foreign taxes and the amortization of intangible assets 
risks of international operations 
certain risks are inherent in international operations  including changes in demand resulting from fluctuations in interest and exchange rates  the risk of government financed competition  changes in trade policies  tariff regulations and difficulties in obtaining export licenses 
changes in relevant foreign currency exchange rates between time of sale and time of payment can also have a material effect on reported financial results 
years ended december  and peo operations compared to peo operations net sales 
net sales of the peo operations consisted of revenues from sales of electron microscope equipment and platforms and related customer service activities 
net sales for the year ended december  increased million compared to the year ended december  gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december  declined by million compared to the year ended december  gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended december  decreased to from for this decrease was primarily attributable to a provision for inventory obsolescence of million  additional costs incurred in rescheduling the production process as a result of a decline in sales due to lower than planned demand from the semiconductor market and intense price competition on sales in certain geographic areas  such as asia 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased by million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase was the result of additional expenditures for the peo operations ongoing research program in sem technology and research and development activities conducted at electroscan and peo brno  each of which were acquired in general  selling and administrative expenses 
general  selling and administrative expenses for the peo operations represented the costs of sales departments and the allocated costs of general management and administration in the countries where the peo operations had sales offices  the costs of general management and administration at the production facilities and the allocated portion of philips corporate costs 
general  selling and administrative expenses increased by million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase is attributable to greater expenditures to develop the market share of the peo operations in the us and asia  and to higher levels of expenditures to develop sales of environmental sem products 
other income and expenses 
in january the peo operations realized other income of million from a single transaction involving the sale of technology licensing rights in the us income taxes 
the peo operations were included in the consolidated income tax return of philips for each country where the peo operations had operations

shares used in per share calculation  basic and diluted   the restatement was primarily the result of the company evaluating its capitalized software development costs and determining that the impairment of value was an event that occurred in the quarter ended march  the company s operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
fluctuations in operating results may be caused by a variety of factors  including the relatively high unit cost of the company s fib workstations and electron microscopes  competitive pricing pressure  conditions in the semiconductor industry  the timing of orders from major customers and new product introductions  customer cancellation or delay of shipments  long sales cycles  changes in the mix of products sold and the proportion of domestic and international sales  specific feature requests by customers  product delays and currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the company will continue to derive a substantial portion of its revenues from the sale of a relatively small number of fib workstations and electron microscopes 
as a result  the timing of revenue recognition from a single order could have a significant impact on the company s net sales and operating results for a reporting period 
a substantial portion of the company s net sales have generally been realized near the end of each quarter and sales of electron microscopes by the peo operations to government funded customers have generally been significantly higher in the fourth quarter 
accordingly  delays in shipments near the end of a quarter could have a substantial negative effect on operating results for that quarter 
announcements by the company or its competitors of new products and technologies could cause customers to defer purchases of the company s existing systems  which could also have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the impact of these and other factors on the company s sales and operating results in any future period cannot be forecast with certainty
