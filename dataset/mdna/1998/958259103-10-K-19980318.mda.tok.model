contributing to the increase in product purchases for the year ended december  compared to were higher payments to producers related to the company s keepwhole contracts at its granger facility 
under a keepwhole contract  the company s margin is reduced when the value of ngls declines relative to the value of gas 
also  contributing to the increases in product purchases for the year ended december  compared to  were lower of cost or market write downs of ngl and gas inventories of million and  respectively 
plant operating expense increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the increase was primarily due to additional compression costs associated with the migc pipeline

however  the company s borrowings under its long term debt agreements  as of december   are consistent with prior year balances  primarily due to costs associated with the construction of the bethel treating facility 
a portion of the decrease in interest expense was also due to interest being capitalized related to the construction of the bethel treating facility 
the bethel treating facility is expected to be substantially completed during the first quarter of  at which time interest will no longer be capitalized to this project

net income increased million and net cash provided by operating activities increased million for the year ended december  compared to the increase in net income for the year was partially due to a million  after tax  impairment loss recorded in in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
and a million  after tax  restructuring charge the company recorded in relating to its cost reduction program 
in addition  net income was positively affected by higher revenues attributable to increases in prices and volumes  partially offset by higher product purchase costs associated with the company s third party gas sales 
revenues from the sale of gas increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to average gas sales volumes increased mmcf per day to  mmcf per day for the year ended december  compared to  largely due to an increase of approximately mmcf per day in the sale of gas purchased from third parties  partially offset by decreased sales at the company s black lake facility

revenue associated with electric power marketing was approximately million  the company entered this market at the end of other net revenue increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the increase was largely due to an increase of approximately million in partnership income  primarily attributable to redman smackover  and a million gain recognized on the sale of the temple facility 
the increase in product purchases corresponds to the increase in third party product sales 
combined product purchases as a percentage of gas  ngl and electric power sales increased from to for the year ended december  compared to the increased product purchase percentage is a continuing trend based upon the growth of third party sales  which typically have lower margins than sales of the company s equity production 
over the past several years  the company has experienced narrowing margins related to the increasing competitiveness of the natural gas marketing industry 
selling and administrative expense increased million for the year ended december  compared to  primarily as a result of growth in the company s marketing operations and higher benefit costs 
depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the decrease was attributable to decreases in production related to the company s oil and gas properties  primarily at the company s black lake facility 
in addition  the company recorded a million write down of certain oil and gas assets and plant facilities in the fourth quarter of in connection with its adoption of sfas no 
the lower asset values contributed to the reduction in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense for the year ended december  these decreases were offset by increases related to various property additions 
interest expense decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to the use of improved cash flows from operations and the use of the company s net proceeds from the november public offering of  shares of common stock to reduce indebtedness under the revolving credit facility 
liquidity and capital resources the company s sources of liquidity and capital resources historically have been net cash provided by operating activities  funds available under its financing facilities and proceeds from offerings of equity securities 
in the past  these sources have been sufficient to meet its needs and finance the growth of the company s business 
the company can give no assurance that the historical sources of liquidity and capital resources will be available for future development and acquisition projects  and it may be required to seek alternative financing sources 
net cash provided by operating activities is primarily affected by product prices and sales of inventory  the company s success in increasing the number and efficiency of its facilities and the volumes of natural gas processed by such facilities  as well as the margin on third party product purchased for resale 
the company s continued growth will be dependent upon success in the areas of marketing  additions to dedicated plant reserves  acquisitions and new project development 
historically  oil prices have been volatile and subject to rapid price fluctuations 
the oil and gas industry is currently experiencing significantly declining oil prices 
such prices have declined approximately during the first quarter of to approximately per barrell as of march  in addition  the start up volumes associated with the bethel treating facility have been lower that anticipated 
if the current price in of oil and associated ngls continues or declines and volumes associated with the bethel treating facility do not increase  the company is uncertain as to its ability to satisfy its interest coverage covenants under certain of its debt agreements during the last half of however  the company believes it can obtain amendments or waivers from the necessary lenders 
the company believes that the amounts available to be borrowed under the revolving credit facility  together with cash provided by operating activities  will provide it with sufficient funds to connect new reserves  maintain its existing facilities and complete its current capital expenditure program 
depending on the timing and the amount of the company s future projects  it may be required to seek additional sources of capital 
the company s ability to secure such capital is restricted by its credit facilities  although it may request additional borrowing capacity from its lenders  seek waivers from its lenders to permit it to borrow funds from third parties  seek replacement credit facilities from other lenders  use stock as a currency for an acquisition  sell existing assets or a combination of such alternatives 
while the company believes that it would be able to secure additional financing  if required  no assurance can be given that it will be able to do so or as to the terms of any such financing 
despite the declining oil prices experienced in the first quarter of  the company also believes that cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet its debt service and preferred stock dividend requirements in the company s sources and uses of funds for the year ended december  are summarized as follows s sources of funds borrowings under revolving credit facility 
 net cash provided by operating activities  other  total sources of funds  uses of funds payments related to long term debt  capital expenditures  dividends paid  total uses of funds  additional sources of liquidity available to the company are volumes of gas and ngls in storage facilities 
the company stores gas and ngls primarily to ensure an adequate supply for long term sales contracts and for resale during periods when prices are favorable 
the company held gas in storage and held imbalances for such purposes of approximately bcf at an average cost of per mcf at december  compared to bcf at an average cost of per mcf at december   at various storage facilities  including the katy facility 
at december   the company had hedging contracts in place for anticipated sales of approximately bcf of stored gas at a weighted average price of per mcf for the stored inventory 
the company held ngls in storage of  mgal  consisting primarily of propane and normal butane  at an average cost of 
per gallon and  mgal at an average cost of 
per gallon at december  and december   respectively  at various third party storage facilities 
at december   the company had hedging contracts in place for anticipated sales  consisting primarily of propane  at a weighted average price of 
per gallon for approximately  mgal of the stored ngls in inventory 
the company has been successful overall in replacing production with new reserves 
historically  the company has connected additional reserves that more than offset production from reserves dedicated to existing facilities 
however  certain individual plants have experienced declines in dedicated reserves 
in  including the reserves associated with the company s joint ventures and partnerships  the company connected new reserves to its gathering systems to replace approximately of production 
on a company wide basis  dedicated reserves increased from approximately tcf as of december  to approximately tcf at december  in november  the company issued  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share 
the net proceeds to the company of million were primarily used to reduce indebtedness under the revolving credit facility

risk management activities the company s commodity price risk management program has two primary objectives 
the first goal is to preserve and enhance the value of the company s equity volumes of gas and ngls with regard to the impact of commodity price movements on cash flow  net income and earnings per share in relation to those anticipated by the company s operating budget 
the second goal is to manage price risk related to the company s physical gas  ngl and power marketing activities to protect profit margins 
this risk relates to hedging fixed price purchase and sale commitments  preserving the value of storage inventories  reducing exposure to physical market price volatility and providing risk management services to a variety of customers 
the company utilizes a combination of fixed price forward contracts  exchange traded futures and options  as well as fixed index swaps  basis swaps and options traded in the over the counter otc market to accomplish these objectives 
these instruments allow the company to preserve value and protect margins because gains or losses in the physical market are offset by corresponding losses or gains in the value of the financial instruments 
the company uses futures  swaps and options to reduce price risk and basis risk 
basis is the difference in price between the physical commodity being hedged and the price of the futures contract used for hedging 
basis risk is the risk that an adverse change in the futures market will not be completely offset by an equal and opposite change in the cash price of the commodity being hedged 
basis risk exists in gas primarily due to the geographic price differentials between cash market locations and futures contract delivery locations 
the company enters into futures transactions on the new york mercantile exchange nymex and the kansas city board of trade and through otc swaps and options with creditworthy counterparties  consisting primarily of financial institutions and other natural gas companies 
the company conducts its standard credit review of otc counterparties and has agreements with such parties that contain collateral requirements 
the company generally uses standardized swap agreements that allow for offset of positive and negative exposures 
otc exposure is marked to market daily for the credit review process 
the company s otc credit risk exposure is partially limited by its ability to require a margin deposit from its major counterparties based upon the mark to market value of their net exposure 
the company is subject to margin deposit requirements under these same agreements 
in addition  the company is subject to similar margin deposit requirements for its nymex counterparties related to its net exposures 
the use of financial instruments may expose the company to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances when i equity volumes are less than expected  ii the company s customers fail to purchase or deliver the contracted quantities of natural gas or ngls  or iii the company s otc counterparties fail to perform 
to the extent that the company engages in hedging activities  it may be prevented from realizing the benefits of favorable price changes in the physical market 
however  it is similarly insulated against decreases in such prices 
as of december   the company held a notional quantity of approximately bcf of natural gas futures  swaps and options  extending from january to december with a weighted average duration of approximately four months 
this was comprised of approximately bcf of long positions and bcf of short positions in such instruments 
as of december   the company held a notional quantity of approximately  mgal of ngl futures  swaps and options  extending from january to december with a weighted average duration of approximately five months

as of december  and  the company did not have any material hedging contracts in place associated with electric power 
the company has hedged a portion of its equity volumes of gas and ngls in  particularly in the first quarter  at pricing levels in excess of its operating budget 
the company s hedging strategy establishes a minimum and maximum price to the company while allowing market participation between these levels 
as of march   the company had hedged approximately of its anticipated equity gas for at a weighted average nymex equivalent minimum price of per mcf  including approximately of first quarter anticipated equity volumes at a weighted average nymex equivalent minimum price of per mcf 
additionally  the company has hedged approximately of its anticipated equity ngls for at a weighted average composite mont belvieu and west texas intermediate crude equivalent minimum price of 
per gallon per barrel  including approximately of first quarter anticipated equity volumes at a weighted average composite mont belvieu and west texas intermediate crude equivalent minimum price of 
per gallon per barrel 
at december   the company had  of losses deferred in inventory that will be recognized primarily during the first quarter of and are expected to be offset by margins from the company s related forward fixed price hedges and physical sales 
at december   the company had unrecognized net losses of million related to financial instruments that are expected to be offset by corresponding unrecognized net gains from the company s obligations to sell physical quantities of gas and ngls 
during  the company began to enter into physical gas transactions payable in canadian dollars 
the company enters into forward purchases of canadian dollars from time to time to fix the cost of its future canadian dollar denominated natural gas purchase  storage and transportation obligations 
this is done to protect marketing margins from adverse changes in the us and canadian dollar exchange rate between the time future payment obligation is made and the actual payment date of such obligation 
as of december  the notional value of such contracts was approximately million in canadian dollars 
as of december   the notional value of such contracts was immaterial 
the company enters into speculative futures  swap and option trades on a very limited basis for purposes that include testing of hedging techniques 
the company s policies contain strict guidelines for such trading including predetermined stop loss requirements and net open positions limits

the company has initiated a comprehensive review of its computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the year issue and is in the process of making the appropriate modifications to its computer systems 
the company expects to incur internal staff costs as well as some consulting and other expenses in order to prepare the systems for the year a portion of these costs are not likely to be incremental costs to the company  but rather will represent costs which will be recorded as assets and depreciated 
accordingly  the company does not expect the amounts required to be expensed over the next year to have a material effect on its results of operations 
costs incurred during the year ended december  were immaterial 
the company anticipates its year conversion project to be completed in a timely manner 
however  there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which the company relies  will also be converted in a timely manner or that any such failure to convert by another company would not have an adverse effect on the company 
in order to minimize this impact  the company is in contact with its vendors and customers to work towards their compliance

the oil and gas industry is currently experiencing significantly declining oil prices 
such prices have declined approximately during the first quarter of to approximately per barrel as of march  in addition  the start up volumes associated with the bethel treating facility have been lower than anticipated 
if the current pricing of oil and associated ngls continues or declines and volumes associated with the bethel treating facility do not increase  the company is uncertain as to its ability to satisfy its interest coverage covenants under certain of its debt agreements during the last half of however  the company believes it can obtain amendments or waivers from the necessary lenders 
environmental the construction and operation of the company s gathering lines  plants and other facilities used for the gathering  transporting  processing  treating or storing of gas and ngls are subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  including those that can impose obligations to clean up hazardous substances at the company s facilities or at facilities to which the company sends wastes for disposal 
in most instances  the applicable regulatory requirements relate to water and air pollution control or waste management

in september  the texas natural resources conservation commission the tnrcc  which has authority to regulate  among other things  stationary air emissions sources  created a committee to make recommendations to the tnrcc regarding a voluntary emissions reduction plan for the permitting of existing grandfathered air emissions sources within the state of texas 
a grandfathered air emissions source is one that does not need a state operating permit because it was constructed prior to the company operates a number of such sources within the state of texas  including its edgewood plant  portions of its midkiff plant and many of its compressors 
the recommendations proposed by the committee would create a voluntary permitting program for grandfathered sources  including certain incentives to participate  such as the ability to operate in such a source in a flexible manner 
it is not clear which of the committee s recommendations  if any  that the tnrcc will implement and it is not possible to assess the potential effect on the company until final regulations are promulgated 
the company anticipates that it is reasonably likely that the trend in environmental legislation and regulation will continue to be towards stricter standards 
the company is unaware of future environmental standards that are reasonably likely to be adopted that will have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations  but it cannot rule out that possibility 
the company is in the process of voluntarily cleaning up substances at certain facilities that it operates
