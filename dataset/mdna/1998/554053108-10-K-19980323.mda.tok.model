the commercial and industrial services include a major electrical job for a hotel and casino in nevada that did not have significant revenue until the fourth quarter of the increase is also a result of the company s success at capitalizing on the rapidly growing trend by its customers to outsource their electrical  telecommunication  facility management and mechanical construction and service requirements

such variables include unusual or unseasonable weather and delays in receipt of construction materials on projects where the materials are provided to the company by its clients 
the different mix of the company s work from period to period can impact gross margin percentage

finally  since the company s revenues are derived principally from providing construction labor services  insurance costs  particularly for workers compensation  are a significant factor in the company s contract cost structure 
fluctuations in insurance reserves for claims under the retrospective rated insurance programs can have a significant impact on gross margins  either upward or downward  in the period in which such insurance reserve adjustments are made
