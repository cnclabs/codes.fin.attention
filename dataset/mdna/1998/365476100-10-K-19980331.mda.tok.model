the company disclaims any obligation to update any such factors or to publicly announce the result of any revisions to any of the forward looking statements contained in this report to reflect future events or developments 
a major element of the company s growth strategy includes a significant print and television media advertising campaign 
the company s past advertising and promotional activities focused primarily on print ads  trade shows and radio advertising  the company has had limited experience with large scale national broadcast advertising 
television advertising is relatively expensive compared to other forms of advertising in terms of dollar outlays 
consequently  the company s increased emphasis on this medium will significantly increase sales and marketing expenses in terms of absolute dollars without any assurance that consumer demand will increase proportionately  if at all 
the majority of the company s net sales have been attributable to its flagship product  the gardenburger veggie patty 
sales of the gardenburger veggie patty and its variants accounted for substantially all of the company s net sales in the company believes that the gardenburger veggie patty will continue to constitute a substantial portion of net sales 
any decrease in the overall level of sales of  or the prices for  the company s gardenburger veggie patty or the failure of demand for the gardenburger veggie patty to increase at the rate currently anticipated  whether as a result of competition  change in consumer demand  or other unforeseen events  could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company currently plans to introduce several new products to its line of meat replacement products during there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully introduce these new products or that any of the new products will gain market acceptance 
the company commenced operations at its new utah facility during the first quarter of and may eventually transfer all manufacturing operations to the utah facility if circumstances so warrant 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience significant difficulties in its transition to the new facility  including  but not limited to  difficulties in maintaining product quality and its ability to hire and train a new workforce 
in addition  the company may experience higher than expected costs in connection with the transition  including costs associated with operating both new and existing facilities simultaneously for longer than anticipated 
in light of the foregoing factors  as well as other variables  past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance and management believes that historical trends should not be relied on to anticipate results or trends in future periods
