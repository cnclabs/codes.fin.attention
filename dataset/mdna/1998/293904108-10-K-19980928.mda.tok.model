item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal years ended june   and revenues 
revenues for the year ended june  increased to  as compared to  for fiscal the components of revenues are sales  which consist of sales of the company s products and royalties on the sale of such products by others  and contract revenues 
sales increased by to  for the year ended june  as compared to  for the prior year 
the increase was due to an increase in adagen sales of approximately  resulting from an increase in patients receiving adagen treatment 
net sales of adagen  which is marketed by enzon  for the years ended june  and were  and  respectively 
oncaspar  the company s other approved product  is marketed in the us and canada by rpr and in europe by medac 
oncaspar revenues are comprised of manufacturing revenues  as well as royalties on sales of oncaspar by rpr 
oncaspar revenues decreased due to a decline in manufacturing revenue resulting from difficulties encountered in the company s manufacturing process  as described below 
the decrease in manufacturing revenue was partially offset by increased royalties due to an increase in sales of oncaspar by rpr 
recently the company s quality assurance department has observed increased levels of particulates in certain batches on oncaspar which it manufactures 
these batches were not shipped and the company s recent rejection rate for the manufacture of this product is significantly higher than it has been historically 
the company is engaged in an extensive review of its manufacturing procedures for this product and believes that the problem may be related to certain materials which are used in the filling process  although this has not yet been determined 
the company has been in discussions with the fda regarding this problem and expects to have further discussions shortly with the fda 
it is possible that the fda may not allow the company to ship oncaspar until this problem is resolved 
however  it is also possible that the fda may permit the company to ship units of oncaspar which the company determines are free from particulates  including units currently on hand 
this problem may result in a temporary or extended disruption in the distribution of oncaspar 
an extended disruption could have a material adverse impact on future oncaspar sales 
the company expects sales of adagen to increase at comparable rates as those achieved during the last two years as additional patients are treated 
the company also anticipates moderate growth of oncaspar sales to its partners and increased royalties on rpr sales of oncaspar for the currently approved indication 
rpr and medac are conducting clinical trials to expand the use of oncaspar beyond its current approved indication which could also result in additional revenues from this product  subject to the manufacturing issue discussed in the preceeding paragraph 
there can be no assurance that any particular sales levels of oncaspar or adagen will be achieved or maintained
