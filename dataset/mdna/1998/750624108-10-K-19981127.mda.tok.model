seasonality the company s business is seasonal  which the company believes is typical of the retail fabric and craft industry 
the company s highest sales and earnings levels historically occur between september and december 
this period includes the back to school  halloween and christmas seasons 
the company has generally operated at a loss during its fourth quarter  the june through august summer period 
see business seasonality 
year to year comparisons of quarterly results and comparable store sales can be affected by a variety of factors  including the timing and duration of holiday selling seasons and the timing of new store openings and promotional markdowns 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary needs for liquidity are to maintain inventory for the company s existing stores and to fund the costs of opening new stores  including capital improvements  initial inventory and pre opening expenses 
in and  the company relied on short term borrowings  internally generated funds and credit made available by suppliers to finance inventories and new store openings 
the company s working capital has increased  in as compared to primarily as a result of the increase in its merchandise inventories and reduction in note payable bank which was partially offset by an increase in accounts payable trade 
the company maintains a million credit facility with a bank 
the credit facility is renewable annually on or before each december and consists of a discretionary  unsecured line of credit for direct borrowings and the issuance and refinance of letters of credit and a  three year term loan maturing may  borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at the bank s prime rate at august  and under the term loan are fixed at seven and one half percent effective march   formerly at eight percent since inception 
the credit facility requires the company to maintain a compensating balance of  in addition to certain financial covenants which require a minimum defined working capital and tangible net worth  a maximum ratio of debt to tangible net worth and set limits on the payment of dividends 
as of august   the company was in compliance with such covenants 
historically  the amount borrowed has varied based on the company s seasonal requirements  generally reaching a maximum amount outstanding during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
the maximum amount borrowed under the line was   and  in  and  respectively 
as of august  and august    and  respectively  was outstanding under the line of credit for direct borrowings and  and  respectively  was outstanding under the term loan with  maturing in the company intends to maintain the availability of the line of credit for working capital requirements and in order to be able to take advantage of future opportunities and to continue to utilize the term loan to finance its new point of sale systems 
the company completed installation of its point of sale systems in all stores as of july in addition  the company is in the test phase of its automated store ordering and receiving systems and anticipates having all stores fully operational by march the company purchases merchandise directly from manufacturers in the far east 
generally  these purchases are supported by letters of credit payable in united states dollars 
the results of operations of the company have not been significantly affected by foreign currency fluctuation 
at august   the company had outstanding letters of credit in the approximate amount of  during  and  the company had net cash provided by operating activities of   and  respectively  and used   and  respectively  for purchases of property and equipment 
cash provided by operating activities increased in primarily as a result of increases in net income and accounts payable partially offset by an increase in merchandise inventories 
the company expects to open five to seven stores and close one existing store during costs associated with opening of new stores  including capital expenditures  inventory and pre opening expenses have approximated  per store 
these costs will be financed primarily from cash provided by operating activities  credit made available by suppliers to finance inventories and  if necessary  from the company s bank line of credit 
however  the company will redeploy assets of stores being closed to the new stores as opportunities evolve in order to curtail the costs of opening stores 
year to conduct its business efficiently  the company relies on several critical information technology it systems for functions including point of sale operations  inventory control  financial and accounting management  communications  purchasing  records retention  and general administrative procedures 
beginning in  the company began an internal review of its it systems to ensure their viability in light of the highly publicized year problem 
the company has also begun to assess other  non it systems such as security and electrical to identify potential year issues that may arise from embedded chip technology 
because the company s use of internal systems that include such technology is limited  management does not expect its non it systems to pose a material year issue 
concurrently  management has been undertaking a general reevaluation of the company s it systems in its effort to enhance efficiency and increase profitability in a highly competitive marketplace 
in several cases  this modernization program has allowed management to address year compliance issues by entirely replacing certain obsolete technology with new systems that are year compliant 
among the systems whose modernization is completed or underway are those controlling inventory  purchasing  point of sale data and central administration 
as part of this review  management has also communicated with its most important suppliers and other vendors to ensure their year compliance 
the company is cooperating with these vendors to upgrade certain software and maintain year compliance both internally and externally 
management believes that its current efforts will allow the company to be fully year compliant by june of  including allowances for integrated testing 
management has allowed for further time in the event certain system elements need additional upgrading 
however  management believes that this possibility is unlikely as much of the necessary work has already been completed and tested 
because the company has focused its attention primarily on updating its systems  it has not yet developed a contingency plan in the event of any interruption of key internal or external services 
management currently expects to complete such a plan by the middle of calendar year  subject to further review and refinement thereafter to reflect changing circumstances 
in particular  the company s plan will seek to establish alternatives in the event of any disturbance in external telecommunications  electric power  financial or transportation networks 
although at this time the company cannot estimate the impact of an interruption in any of these services  it is possible that a sustained disruption would materially affect the company s operations and financial results 
since most of the company s year compliance expenses have arisen in the context of a general it modernization  management does not believe that these remediation costs will rise to a material level
