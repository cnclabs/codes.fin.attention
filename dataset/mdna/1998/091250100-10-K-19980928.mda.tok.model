the company is currently in compliance with its restrictive debt covenants 
however  should any of the factors described under risk factors that may affect future results adversely affect fiscal operating results  the company could violate one or more of its restrictive covenants within the next twelve months 
the company is evaluating its alternatives in the event that it is unable to comply with its restrictive covenants in the near term 
the alternatives include  but are not limited to  obtaining waivers for possible future violations  amending the covenants or refinancing the company s outstanding obligations 
if it becomes necessary to obtain waivers or amendments  the company does not expect that these alternatives would have a significant impact on future results of operations 
however  should it become necessary to refinance one or more of the company s long term facilities  the company may incur increased interest costs and debt extinguishment losses  both of which could be material to future results of operations

market risk sensitive instruments the market risk inherent in the company s financial instruments represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates principally us treasury and prime bank rates 
in order to manage this risk  the company attempts to maintain certain ratios of fixed to variable rate debt 
however  the company does not currently use derivative financial instruments 
at june   the company had fixed rate long term debt with a carrying value of million and variable rate borrowings of million outstanding 
assuming a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates  the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt would decrease by million and the company would incur an additional million in interest expense on variable rate borrowings 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical change in interest rates on the company s cost of borrowing 
the analysis does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure 
working capital working capital in fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal outlook from a long term perspective  the company s broad access to capital markets and internal cash flows are expected to be sufficient to provide the capital resources necessary to support increased operating needs and to finance continued growth 
risk factors that may affect future results all forward looking statements included in this document are based upon information available to the company on the date hereof  and the company assumes no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
it is important to note that the company s actual results could differ materially from those described or implied in such forward looking statements 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the factors detailed below 
in addition  readers should consider the risk factors described from time to time in company reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
the company is in the steel industry  an industry that is vulnerable to unpredictable economic cycles 
a downturn in the economy or in the company s markets could have an adverse effect on the company s performance 
the company produces some products which are subject to competition from foreign imports 
fluctuations in exchange rates or a decline in foreign economic conditions may adversely affect the company s performance 
in fiscal  an economic downturn in asia has led to an excess supply of world steel products 
although demand for steel products in the united states is strong  this situation has created precarious conditions in the us steel industry  particularly with respect to price and volumes 
continuation of the economic crisis in asia could negatively impact the company s results 
the company has attempted to spread its sales across the reinforcing bar  merchant product and special bar quality markets to reduce the company s vulnerability to an economic downturn in any one product market 
the company s performance  however  can still be materially affected by changes in demand for any one of its product lines and by changes in the economic condition of the construction industry  manufacturing industry or automobile industry 
the cost of scrap is the largest element in the cost of the company s finished rebar and merchant products 
the company purchases most of its scrap on a short term basis 
changes in the price of scrap can significantly affect the company s profitability 
changes in other raw material prices can also influence the company s profitability 
prices for some of the company s products are positively affected by the influence of trade sanctions or restrictions imposed on the company s foreign competitors 
changes in these sanctions or restrictions or their enforcement could adversely affect the company s results 
energy costs are also a significant factor influencing the company s results 
current reforms in the electric utility industry at the state and federal level are expected to lower energy costs in the long run 
however  numerous utilities and political groups are contesting these reforms and states are approaching the reforms in different fashions 
the possibility exists  therefore  that the company could be exposed to energy costs which are less favorable than those available to its competitors 
such a situation could materially affect the company s performance 
further  the partial deregulation of certain energy markets now in effect may lead to significant price increases that would adversely affect the company s performance 
the company s new melt shop in memphis  tennessee continues to be in a start up mode and is not currently operating at a commercially viable production level 
continued delays or other start up issues in this project could materially adversely affect the company s future results 
while in start up operations  the facility can experience learning curve problems which would prevent the company from realizing the timing of certain plans that it has made for the future 
in addition  a decrease in demand for sbq products could result in reduced production requirements and delay the planned ramp up of production at memphis 
until the memphis melt shop begins producing at acceptable levels and costs  the company s sbq division will continue to purchase some of its steel billets from third parties 
the cost of these steel billets is a significant portion of the cost of the sbq division s finished products 
thus  the performance of this division  and in turn  the performance of the company  can be materially affected by changes in the price of the steel billets it buys from third parties 
the company is constantly engaged in the process of evaluating new opportunities to strengthen its long term business and financial prospects 
from time to time  this process may lead the company to make strategic investments  such as acquisitions and joint ventures  which have the potential to improve the company s position in the markets in which it currently competes  as well as new markets it may choose to enter 
in connection with these investments  the company may incur  either directly or indirectly  start up expenses  losses and other charges that may have a material affect on the company s financial performance 
the company expects to begin start up operations of a new mid section rolling mill at its cartersville facility in the second half of fiscal results in fiscal will reflect start up losses associated with this project and unexpected start up losses could negatively impact the company s financial performance 
the company s scrap joint venture in california was established to collect and process scrap in the southern california region for export to the pacific rim countries 
the west coast scrap venture is particularly susceptible to changes to the economic situation in asia 
in fiscal  the west coast scrap venture recorded a loss 
continuation of the present economic conditions in asia would have an adverse impact on the results of the operations for this joint venture 
the company believes its labor relations are generally good 
almost the entire work force is non union and the company has never suffered a strike or other labor related work stoppage 
if this situation changes  the company s performance could suffer material adverse effects 
the company operates in an industry subject to numerous environmental regulations 
changes in environmental regulations or in the interpretation or manner of enforcement of environmental regulations could materially affect the company s performance 
the company is not currently planning or performing any environmental remediations 
if  however  the need to perform an environmental remediation should arise  costs could be substantial 
depending upon the nature and location of the problem  insurance coverage may or may not cover some or all of the costs associated with the remediation 
the company s economic performance  like most manufacturing companies  is vulnerable to a catastrophe that disables one or more of its manufacturing facilities and to major equipment failure 
depending upon the nature of the catastrophe or equipment failure  available insurance may or may not cover a loss resulting from such a catastrophe or equipment failure and the loss resulting from such a catastrophe or equipment failure could materially affect the company s earnings 
the company s efforts to address year issues are dependent in part upon the ability of certain software vendors to deliver certain modifications to software used by the company timely and are dependent upon information received from customers and vendors upon which the company has reasonably relied 
should such software vendors fail to deliver its modifications timely  the company s efforts to address its year issues may be affected 
should any significant third party representation be inaccurate  the company may be negatively affected 
the company anticipates that it will continue to borrow funds in the future 
increases in interest rates or changes in the company s ability to borrow funds could materially affect the company s performance 
the company s ability to borrow funds and the interest rates at which it can borrow such funds can be affected by the company s financial performance and compliance with various ratios and covenants employed by lenders 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations the company is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning  among other matters  waste water effluents  air emissions and furnace dust management and disposal 
company management is highly conscious of these regulations  and supports an ongoing program to maintain the company s strict adherence to required standards 
the company was previously advised by the virginia department of waste management of certain conditions involving the disposal of hazardous materials at the company s norfolk  virginia property which existed prior to the company s acquisition of the facility 
the site was accepted into virginia s voluntary remediation program 
this program allows regulatory closure upon certification by the virginia department of environmental quality of the site remediation 
on december   the property was sold to a company specializing in remediation and rehabilitation or brownfield properties 
environmental liabilities and the obligation to perform the remediation site plan as approved by the virginia department of environmental quality were transferred to or assumed by the purchaser 
the company was notified by the department of toxic substances control dtsc of the environmental protection agency of the state of california of certain environmental conditions regarding its property in emeryville  california 
the company performed complete environmental remediation of that property in accordance with the remediation plan for the site which was approved by dtsc 
the company received letters from dtsc confirming that the site has been remediated in accordance with the approved remedial implementation plan and an approved remedial completion report and thereafter sold the emeryville property in october as part of its ongoing environmental compliance and monitoring programs  the company is voluntarily developing work plans for environmental conditions involving certain of its operating facilities 
based upon the company s study of the known conditions and its prior experience in investigating and correcting environmental conditions  the company believes that the costs associated with these work plans will not be material 
except as stated above  the company believes that it is currently in compliance with all known material and applicable environmental regulations 
year the following year discussion is provided in response to the securities and exchange commission s recent interpretative statement expressing its view that public companies should include detailed discussion of year issues in their md a 
the company is pursuing an organized program to assure the company s information technology systems and related infrastructure will be year compliant 
the company has divided its year issues into five areas including business systems at corporate headquarters  business systems at the cleveland  ohio operation  infrastructure systems at all locations  manufacturing systems at all locations  and facility and support systems at all locations 
the company includes certain systems which might not be considered as it systems  such as phone switches and certain safety systems  in the facility and support systems area of the year project 
the company s year program includes three phases an audit and assessment phase designed to identify year issues  a modification phase designed to correct year issues this phase includes testing of individual modifications as they are installed  and a testing phase to test entire systems for year compliance after individual modifications have been installed and tested 
a dedicated year project manager has been assigned to this project for over one year 
project teams have been assembled for each area  specific responsibilities have been identified and specific time lines have been prepared for the activities to take place within each area of the project 
senior management receives monthly updates on the progress against the time lines for each strategic area 
the company has completed the audit and assessment phase for both the business systems at the corporate headquarters and at the cleveland  ohio operation and for infrastructure at all locations 
the company currently expects that the audit and assessment phase will be completed for the remaining areas prior to december  the company is currently performing the second phase of its program  involving modifications and testing of the individual modifications  on its business systems at both the corporate headquarters and the cleveland  ohio operation 
the company expects to complete the second phase of its program for these business systems by december  this schedule allows for six months of contingency time prior to the july  deadline the beginning of the company s fiscal year for completion of these upgrades 
the company expects to conduct the third phase test of its business systems in the first calendar quarter of the company currently expects to complete the second phase of its program modifications and testing for its infrastructure systems  manufacturing systems  facility and support systems by june  leaving six months of contingency time before the december  deadline for completion of year modifications of these systems 
appropriate systems testing will be conducted after june  and problems which are identified will then be corrected 
management has determined that the costs for correction of the year issues  including any software and hardware changes but excluding any hardware systems that would have been replaced in any event and the cost of personnel involved in working on this project  will be less than million 
the company estimates that of the costs have been spent to date 
the year upgrades are being funded out of the normal operating funds  and account for less than of the company s it budget 
the year compliance effort is a priority project for the company s it department 
other it projects  however  including upgrades of certain existing systems and design and installation of new systems  continue while the year effort is being accomplished 
the company s year program also includes investigation of major vendors and customers year readiness 
the company is using questionnaires  letters and protocols to determine its vendors and customers year readiness 
the company is contacting  for example  energy and scrap vendors and its phone and data line service vendors to determine their year compliance status 
if any such vendors indicate that they will not be year compliant  the company will develop contingency plans to address the issue  which may include changing vendors 
in addition  the company is contacting significant customers to determine their progress towards year compliance and to identify issues  if any  which might develop because of customers failure to be prepared for year issues 
in the event issues are identified  the company expects to try to develop procedures to permit the company to continue to supply the customer involved despite the year issues 
the company has been assured by its key financial institutions that they are already year compliant or will be year compliant in early at the present time  the company does not have a contingency plan to operate in the event that its business systems are not year compliant 
if testing scheduled for the first calendar quarter of suggests that there is a significant risk that the business systems might not be year compliance  a contingency plan will be developed 
notice various statements in this discussion of year are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements include statements of the company s expectations  statements with regard to schedules and expected completion dates and statements regarding expected year compliance 
these forward looking statements are subject to various risk factors which may materially affect the company s efforts to achieve year compliance 
these risk factors include the inability of the company to complete the plans and modifications that it has identified  the failure of software vendors to deliver the upgrades and repairs to which they have committed  the wide variety of information technology systems and components  both hardware and software  that must be evaluated and the large number of vendors and customers with which the company interacts 
the company s assessments of the effects of year on the company are based  in part  upon information received from third parties and the company s reasonable reliance on that information 
therefore  the risk that inaccurate information is supplied by third parties upon which the company reasonably relied must be considered as a risk factor that might affect the company s year efforts 
the company is attempting to reduce the risks by utilizing an organized approach  extensive testing  and allowance of ample contingency time to address issues identified by tests 
impact of inflation the company has not experienced any material adverse effects on operations in recent years because of inflation  though margins can be affected by inflationary conditions 
the company s primary cost components are ferrous scrap  high quality semi finished steel billets  energy and labor  all of which are susceptible to domestic inflationary pressures 
finished product prices  however  are influenced by nationwide construction activity  automotive production and manufacturing capacity within the steel industry and  to a lesser extent  the availability of lower priced foreign steel in the company s market channels 
while the company has generally been successful in passing on cost increases through price adjustments  the effect of steel imports  severe market price competition and under utilized industry capacity has in the past  and could in the future  limit the company s ability to adjust pricing
