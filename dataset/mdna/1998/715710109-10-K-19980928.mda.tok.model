overview pervasive is a worldwide provider of ultra light  embedded database and information management software for packaged client server applications 
the software is designed for integration by independent software vendors isvs into packaged applications that are deployed in environments without a dedicated database administrator dba 
the company s pervasive 
sql tm database engine  which combines high performance transactional and industry standard relational data access  enables isvs to deliver easy to use  reliable and cost effective applications to end users 
as a result  end users can concentrate on running their businesses instead of managing the database underlying their applications 
this is particularly critical in the large number of zero dba or z dba tm environments typically found in small and mid sized businesses or departments of large organizations that lack the information technology infrastructure or personnel required to deploy and support client server applications 
the company derives its revenues primarily from shrink wrap licenses through isvs  vars and distributors and from oem license agreements with isvs 
additionally  the company generates revenues from user count upgrades as well as from upgrades to client server environments from single user workstation or peer to peer environments 
shrink wrap license fees depend on both the user count of the license and whether the license is for the company s client or server based products 
the company s oem licensing program offers isvs volume discounts and specialized technical support  training and consulting in exchange for embedding the company s products in packaged applications and paying to the company a royalty based on sales of the applications 
revenues are generally recognized from the license of software upon the later of shipment or when all significant vendor obligations have been satisfied 
revenues related to agreements involving nonrefundable fixed minimum license fees are generally recognized upon delivery of the product master or first copy if no significant vendor obligations remain 
per copy royalties in excess of a fixed minimum amount are recognized as revenues when such amounts are reported to the company 
the company operates with virtually no order backlog because its software products are shipped shortly after orders are received  which makes product revenues in any quarter substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped throughout that quarter 
the company enters into agreements with certain distributors that provide for certain stock rotation and price protection rights 
these rights allow the distributor to return products in a non cash exchange for other products or for credits against future purchases 
the company reserves for the cost of estimated sales returns  stock rotation and price protection rights  as well as for uncollectable accounts based on experience 
on february   the company announced the introduction of pervasive 
sql tm  an enhanced database software product that enables packaged client server applications to simultaneously access a single database engine with both high volume transactional processing and industry standard sql capabilities 
the software is designed for integration by isvs into packaged client server and internet based applications that are deployed in z dba environments 
pervasive 
sql delivers improved performance  simplified installation and maintenance  low cost of ownership and compatibility with existing btrieve and scalable sql based applications 
the company began shipping pervasive 
sql in february of prior to the release of pervasive 
sql  the company derived substantially all of its revenues from the license of its btrieve and scalable sql products 
the company expects that its future operating results will become increasingly dependent upon market acceptance of its recently announced pervasive 
sql product and anticipates that revenues from the license of btrieve and scalable sql will decrease accordingly 
the pace and timing of market acceptance of pervasive 
sql is largely dependent upon factors such as the product development cycles of isvs and vars who embed the company s products into third party packaged software applications 
as a result  the company expects to continue to derive a significant portion of its revenues from the license of btrieve and scalable sql in the near term and there can be no assurance as to whether or when pervasive 
sql will achieve sustainable market acceptance 
a low demand for  or low or delayed market acceptance of the company s pervasive 
sql product as a result of competition  technological change or other factors  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
although the company recognized revenue in the third and fourth quarters of related to initial sales of pervasive 
sql  such sales may have been attributable to one time upgrades from earlier versions of the company s products  favorable upgrade pricing by the company or other factors 
as pervasive 
sql has only recently been released  there can be no assurance that future sales will continue at initial rates

results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of revenues represented by certain lines in the company s consolidated statements of operations year ended june  revenues costs and expenses cost of revenues and technical support sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total costs and expenses operating income interest and other income income before income taxes and minority interest provision for income taxes minority interest in earnings of subsidiary net income revenues the company s revenues were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively  an increase of from fiscal to  and from fiscal to the increase in the company s revenues was attributable primarily to increased market acceptance of the company s products  principally licenses of the company s software operating on windows nt  introduction of pervasive 
sql and expansion of its worldwide sales organization 
in addition  the increase in revenues from to was also attributable to market acceptance of price increases for most products instituted in june although the company s revenues have increased in recent periods  there can be no assurance that revenues will grow in future periods  that they will grow at past rates or that the company will remain profitable on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
licenses of the company s software operating on windows nt or other microsoft operating systems increased to approximately of the company s revenues in fiscal from approximately in the prior year 
licenses of the company s software operating on netware represented approximately of revenues in fiscal  as compared to in the prior year 
the company believes that the increase in the percentage of revenues attributable to licenses of the company s products operating on windows nt and other microsoft operating systems is due both to increased market acceptance of the company s products operating on microsoft platforms and to the increased market penetration of microsoft platforms relative to other operating systems 
the company expects that the percentages of its revenues attributable to licenses of its software operating on particular platforms will continue to change from time to time and there can be no assurance that the company s revenues attributable to licenses of its software operating on windows nt  or any other operating system platform  will grow in the future  or at all 
international revenues  consisting of all revenues from customers located outside of north america  were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
the increase in dollar amount in each period was primarily attributable to expansion of the company s international sales organization  particularly in europe 
the decrease in international revenues as a percentage of revenues from fiscal to was primarily due to the increasing contribution to revenues from the company s domestic oem licensing program and  to a lesser extent  from the june price increase 
the company believes that revenues from international markets represent a significant opportunity and expects that international revenues may account for an increasing portion of its revenues in the future as the company expands internationally  primarily in europe and japan  but also in other areas of the world 
see risk factors that may affect future results risks associated with international sales and operations and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in february  the company began marketing certain complementary third party products through its channel 
those third party products now include crystal reports  an industry standard report writer from seagate software that allows end users to generate sophisticated reports on their pervasive 
sql  btrieve or scalable sql databases  and powerful data conversion tools from data junction corporation  which enable software developers to quickly and easily transfer data from other sources into a pervasive 
sql database 
revenue from third party products was not significant in fiscal costs and expenses cost of revenues and technical support 
cost of revenues and technical support consists primarily of the cost to manufacture and fulfill orders for the company s shrink wrap software products and the cost to provide technical support  primarily telephone support  which is typically provided within days of purchase 
cost of revenues and technical support was million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of revenues  respectively 
the increase in cost of revenues and technical support in each period was attributable to increased sales volume and increased technical support personnel in the us and in europe 
the company anticipates that cost of revenues and technical support will continue to increase in dollar amount as the company expands its international operations  particularly in japan  and provides technical support for additional products 
such costs could vary as a percentage of revenues relative to comparable periods in prior years 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses earned by sales and marketing personnel  foreign sales office expenses  travel and entertainment  marketing programs and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of revenues  respectively 
the increase in dollar amounts from fiscal to was primarily attributable to increased costs associated with hiring additional sales and marketing personnel and  to a lesser extent  increased infrastructure costs associated with foreign sales office expansion  partially offset by a reduction of approximately million in marketing costs associated with the company s shift away from advertising toward more direct mail oriented lead generation activities 
sales and marketing expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues in fiscal primarily because of significant revenue growth that outpaced sales and marketing expenditures 
the increase in dollar amounts from fiscal to was primarily due to increased costs associated with hiring additional sales and marketing personnel  the initial promotion of pervasive 
sql and increased infrastructure costs associated with foreign sales office expansion 
the company expects that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in dollar amount as the company continues to promote pervasive 
sql and its other products  hire additional sales and marketing personnel  increase lead generation activities and expand its international operations 
sales and marketing expenses are likely to continue to fluctuate as a percentage of revenues due to the timing of costs associated with new product releases and international expansion 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of revenues  respectively 
the increase in dollar amount each period was primarily due to the increased hiring of  and contracting with  additional research and development personnel 
research and development expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues in fiscal primarily because of significant revenue growth that outpaced research and development expenditures 
the company anticipates that it will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and that such expenses will continue to increase in dollar amount 
software development costs that were eligible for capitalization in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
were insignificant during these periods  and  accordingly  the company charged all software development costs to research and development expenses 
in march  the company announced a joint development initiative with oracle corporation to enable application developers to create and deploy a single application for both small businesses and large corporations without substantial code changes 
the joint development effort should also allow existing packaged application providers to migrate their solutions to pervasive and oracle databases 
research and development expenses related to the joint development initiative with oracle were not material for the year ended june   however  these expenses are expected to increase in the future 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the personnel and other costs of the company s finance  human resources  information systems and administrative departments 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of revenues  respectively 
the increase in dollar amount in each period was primarily due to the increased staffing and associated expenses necessary to manage and support the company s increased scale of operations  both domestically and internationally 
general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue in each period primarily because of significant revenue growth that outpaced general and administrative expenditures 
the company believes that its general and administrative expenses will increase in dollar amount in the future as the company s administrative staff expands to support its growing worldwide operations and as a result of an increase in expenses associated with being a public company 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes was approximately   and million in fiscal  and respectively 
the company s effective tax rates were and for fiscal and  respectfully 
tax expense in fiscal  and an insignificant portion of the tax expense in fiscal and  represents withholding taxes paid or accrued to be paid to foreign countries on royalties earned by the company 
the increase in the company s effective tax rate for fiscal year is primarily due to increased foreign taxes associated with the company s increased operations overseas 
the company believes that  based on a number of factors  it is more likely than not that a substantial amount of the company s deferred tax assets may not be realized 
these factors include a limited history of profitability  recent increases in expense levels to support the company s growth  the lack of carryback capacity to realize the deferred tax assets and the fact that the company operates in an intensely competitive market subject to rapid change 
accordingly  the company has recorded a valuation allowance to the extent deferred tax assets exceed the potential benefit from carryback of deferred items to offset current or prior year taxable income 
the company expects its effective tax rate will increase in the future once the company s deferred tax asset is fully realized

quarterly results from operations the following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly information for the company s last eight fiscal quarters 
the company believes that this information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k and believes that all necessary adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments have been included in the amounts stated below and present fairly the results of such periods when read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto

such fluctuations may result in volatility in the price of the company s common stock 
the company establishes its expenditure levels based on its expectations as to future revenue  and  if revenue levels are below expectations  expenses can be disproportionately high 
as a result  a drop in near term demand for the company s products could significantly affect both revenues and profits in any quarter 
in the future  the company s operating results may fluctuate for this reason or as a result of a number of other factors  including increased expenses  timing of product releases  increased competition  variations in the mix of sales  announcements of new products by the company or its competitors and capital spending patterns of the company s customers 
as a result of these factors  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain profitability on a quarterly basis 
see risk factors that may affect future results 
liquidity and capital resources on september  the company completed an initial public offering in which the company sold  shares of common stock for net proceeds to the company of million  after deducting the underwriter s discount and expenses of the offering 
in fiscal  cash used in operations was million 
cash provided by operations was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in cash generated by operations from fiscal to resulted primarily from increases in accounts receivable consistent with the increased sales volume during fiscal during fiscal  the company invested million in marketable securities  consisting of various taxable and tax advantaged securities 
in addition  the company purchased property and equipment totaling approximately  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  primarily computer hardware and software for the company s growing employee base 
the company expects that its capital expenditures will increase when the company moves to larger facilities and as the company s employee base grows 
the company will move its headquarters from its current facility of approximately  square feet to a new facility of approximately  square feet in the second quarter of fiscal the new facility will provide additional space and expansion options to accommodate future growth at rental rates per square foot consistent with the current facility 
the company expects to incur approximately million in capital expenditures and an increase in rent expense in fiscal as a result of the move 
on february   the company acquired an additional ownership interest in its majority owned subsidiary  pervasive software co  ltd

the company has a million revolving line of credit with a bank  but has at no time borrowed under such line 
the company s line of credit contains certain financial covenants and restrictions as to various matters including the company s ability to pay cash dividends and effect mergers or acquisitions without the bank s prior approval 
the company is currently in compliance with such financial covenants and restrictions

the company is required to adopt statement in fiscal the company believes that the adoption of statement will not affect its results of operations or financial position  and will not significantly affect the disclosure of segment information in the future 
year compliance the year issue results from an industry wide practice of representing years with only two digits instead of four 
beginning in the year  date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish twenty first century dates from twentieth century dates or 
as a result  in less than two years  computer systems and or software used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
significant uncertainty exists in the software industry concerning the potential effects associated with such compliance 
the company s year readiness plan for current versions of its products  pervasive 
sql  btrieve v  scalable sql and odbc interface v includes the following assessment take an inventory of products to be tested  survey third party programs utilized  generate compliance plan  and define what compliance will mean 
implementation devise upgrades to correct any year issues 
validation test and debug current versions of products 
contingency planning plan to implement in the event that the company does not achieve year compliance by january  the company has essentially completed all phases of its plan  except for contingency planning  with respect to the current versions of all of its products 
as a result  each of the current versions of its products was found to have no known year limitations  when configured and used in accordance with the related documentation  and provided that the underlying operating system of the host machine and any other software used with or in the host machine are also year compliant 
an earlier release of scalable sql is not year compliant and several other earlier versions of the company s products have not been tested for year compliance 
these earlier versions of the company s products are no longer supported by pervasive software 
the company recommends upgrading to the current version of its products if customers have any concerns 
pervasive has defined year compliant as the ability to correctly handle date information needed for the transition from december  to january  function according to the product documentation provided for this date change  without changes in operation resulting from the approaching new century  assuming correct configuration 
where appropriate  respond to two digit date input in a way that resolves the ambiguity as to century in a disclosed  defined  and predetermined manner 
if the date elements in interfaces and data storage specify the century  store and provide output of date information in ways that are unambiguous as to century 
recognize year as a leap year 
third party applications which utilize pervasive products can still be written that do not take advantage of the year capabilities of pervasive s products 
pervasive does not currently have any information concerning the year compliance status of its customers or third party vendors who imbed or resell pervasive s products 
if pervasive s current or future customers fail to achieve year compliance or if they divert technology expenditures away from software products such as those offered by the company to address year issues  the company s business  operating results  or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
pervasive has not specifically tested software licensed from third parties that is marketed through the company s channel  but the company has received warranties and representations from its vendors that licensed software is year compliant 
despite testing by pervasive and current and potential customers  and assurances from developers of products incorporated into pervasive s products  the company s products may contain undetected errors or defects associated with year date functions 
unknown errors or defects in pervasive s products could result in loss of revenues or delay in market acceptance  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s internal systems include both its information technology it and non it systems such as its security system  building equipment  and embedded microcontrollers 
the company has initiated an informal year compliance project to assess its material internal it systems and its non it systems 
the project encompasses two major areas of pervasive s internal it structure 
the technical services area  including all hardware  operating system  and standard application issues  and the applications area  including all corporate database  accounting and custom applications 
to the extent that the company is not able to test the technology provided by third party vendors  the company is seeking assurances from such vendors that their systems are year compliant 
although pervasive is not currently aware of any material operational issues or costs associated with preparing its internal it and non it systems for the year  the company may experience material unanticipated problems and costs caused by undetected errors or defects in the technology used in its internal it and non it systems 
the company plans to formalize its internal it and non it year readiness plan beginning january the company anticipates that a majority of the existing year issues will be eliminated by this time and it believes that this time frame will provide adequate time to resolve any remaining material issues 
the company has funded its year plan from operating cash flows and has not separately accounted for these costs in the past  nor does the company have specific dollars budgeted for the project as the costs are not considered to be material 
pervasive has not yet fully developed a comprehensive contingency plan to address situations that may result if the company is unable to achieve year compliance of its critical operations 
the cost of developing and implementing such a plan may itself be material 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the majority of the company s operations are based in the us and  accordingly  the majority of its transactions are denominated in us dollars 
however  the company does have foreign based operations where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
currently  the company has operations in japan  germany  france  ireland  england  belgium  and hong kong and conducts transactions in the local currency of each location 
in fiscal the us dollar strengthened against the japanese yen 
had the us dollar to japanese yen rate remained unchanged throughout fiscal  the result would have been an increase in revenue and operating income of approximately  and  respectively 
the impact of fluctuations in the relative value of other currencies was not material for fiscal the company monitors its foreign currency exposure and  from time to time will attempt to reduce its exposure through hedging 
at june   the company had two offsetting foreign currency contracts outstanding with notional amounts of approximately  such contracts mature in march gains and losses on foreign currency hedging were not material to the consolidated financial statements for years ending june   and pervasive is subject to interest rate risk on its cash and marketable securities investments  however  this risk is limited as the company s investment policy requires the company to invest in short term securities and maintain an average maturity of one year or less
