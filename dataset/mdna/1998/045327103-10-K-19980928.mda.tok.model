item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since its founding in  the company has developed and marketed software and services to companies in the process industries 
the company s revenues have increased each year since  when the company introduced the commercial version of its aspen plus process design software solution 
in addition to internally generated growth  the company has acquired businesses since may  including industrial systems  inc isi in the fourth quarter of fiscal  dmcc and setpoint in the third quarter of fiscal  and chesapeake in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company acquired dmcc  setpoint and three other  less material businesses in transactions accounted for as purchases 
the company s results of operations include the results of operations of dmcc  setpoint and these three other companies only for periods subsequent to their respective dates of acquisition 
as of result  period to period comparisons of the company s results of operations may not be meaningful

see item business software and service solutions 
because in all cases the licenses are noncancelable and do not impose significant obligations on the company  the company recognizes software license revenues upon shipment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in the case of license renewals  revenue is recognized upon execution of a renewal license agreement 
the company recognizes revenues from customer support ratably over the term of the support agreement 
if a customer elects to pay for a license in annual installments  the company charges an implicit amount of interest and recognizes interest income over the term of the license 
a substantial majority of the company s term licenses have been renewed upon expiration 
however  there can be no assurance that customers will continue to renew expiring term licenses at the historical rate 
prior to fiscal  the company derived the substantial majority of its total revenues from the licensing of software products 
since the acquisitions of dmcc and setpoint in the third quarter of fiscal  the company has generated a significantly greater amount of service revenues related to the implementation of its software solutions  particularly in connection with projects involving advanced process control and real time optimization 
for fiscal  the company derived of its total revenues from the licensing of software products and of its total revenues from the provision of services 
the company generally charges customers for consulting services on a fixed price basis  but charges customers for certain services  primarily on site advanced process control and optimization services  on a time and materials basis 
service revenues from fixed price contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the portion of costs incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total primarily labor costs for each contract 
service revenues from time and materials contracts are recognized as the related services are performed 
training revenues are recognized as services are performed 
services that have been performed but for which billings have not been made are recorded as unbilled receivables  and billings for which services have not been performed are recorded as unearned revenue in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company licenses its software in us dollars and certain foreign currencies 
the company hedges all material foreign currency denominated receivables with specific hedge contracts in amounts equal to those receivables 
while the company has experienced minor foreign currency exchange gains or losses due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations  the impact of such movements has not been material in any period 
the company does not expect fluctuations in foreign currencies to have a significant impact on either its revenues or expenses in the foreseeable future 
the company s operating costs include the amortization of intangible assets  including goodwill  arising from acquisitions accounted for as purchases 
the net balance of these intangible assets as of june  was million and is being amortized over periods ranging from to years 
the amortization from completed acquisitions that was charged to operations was million for fiscal and million for fiscal and will be  for each of the next quarters and  for each of the next succeeding quarters 
the company s operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal were adversely affected by the level of telecommunications and overhead charges incurred across the company 
these charges  which are allocated to various cost and expense line items in the company s statements of operation  did not materially increase any particular cost or expense 
in the aggregate  however  the level of these expenses contributed to the company s reporting lower than planned net income for the fiscal quarter and year ended june  results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues represented by certain consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated year ended june  revenues software licenses service and other total revenues expenses cost of software licenses cost of service and other selling and marketing research and development general and administrative charge for in process research and development costs related to acquisitions total expenses income loss from operations interest income interest expense other income expense  net income loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss comparison of fiscal to fiscal revenues

total revenues from customers outside the united states were million or of total revenues and million or of total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
the geographical mix of revenues can vary from quarter to quarter 
revenues from service and other consist of consulting services  post contract support on software licenses  training and sales of documentation 
revenues from service and other for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal this increase reflects a continued focus during fiscal on providing high value added consulting and training services to existing customers 
revenues from service and other for fiscal was adversely affected by lower than planned levels of consultant utilization attributable to temporary mismatches between types and geographies of scheduled projects  the skill sets and locations of available personnel and the timing of certain project starts 
during the second half of fiscal the company implemented programs intended to mitigate these issues through  for example  targeted sales incentives and improved information flow between sales and consulting personnel 
neither the company s joint venture or similar activities nor any discounting or similar activities have historically had a material effect on the company s revenues 
cost of software licenses 
cost of software licenses consists of royalties  amortization of previously capitalized software costs  costs related to delivery of software including disk duplication and third party software costs  printing of manuals and packaging 
cost of software licenses for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal cost of software licenses as a percentage of revenues from software licenses increased to for fiscal from for fiscal this increase was due to the generation of a greater portion of sales having third party software and royalty costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal cost of service and other

cost of service and other for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal cost of service and other as a percentage of revenues from services and other increased to for fiscal from for fiscal this percentage increase reflects a change in mix to more application consulting services  which have a higher cost base  and  to a lesser extent  special payments made in connection with a transitional incentive compensation plan for consultants based on hours billed 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal while increasing slightly as a percentage of revenues to from 
the dollar and percentage increases were attributable in part to compensation earned by sales personnel who exceeded their quotas and earned commissions at higher rates 
the company continues to invest in sales personnel and regional sales offices to improve the company s geographic proximity to its customers  to maximize the penetration of existing accounts and to add new customers 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist of personnel and outside consultancy costs required to conduct the company s product development efforts 
capitalized research and development costs are amortized over the estimated remaining economic life of the relevant product  not to exceed three years 
research and development expenses for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal while decreasing slightly as a percentage of total revenues to from 
the increase in costs principally reflects continued investment in development of the company s core modeling products and a common software architecture encompassing the company s expanded family of software products 
the company capitalized of its total research and development costs during fiscal as compared to in fiscal general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries of administrative  executive  financial and legal personnel  outside professional fees and amortization of intangibles 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal  while decreasing as a percentage of total revenues to from 
these costs did not grow at the same rate as revenues  as the company s infrastructure was able to support a larger revenue base  however  the increased dollar amounts reflect the growth in the scale and scope of the company s operations 
charge for in process research and development 
in connection with several acquisitions during fiscal and  the company allocated million and million  respectively  of the purchase prices to in process research and development based upon independent appraisals 
these costs were charged to operations as of the respective acquisition dates  because they related to projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and that had no alternative future use until completion of development 
at the respective times of the acquisitions  these projects required substantial additional development and testing by the company in order to reach technological feasibility and there was no assurance that these projects would reach technological feasibility or develop into products that could be sold by the company 
cost related to acquisitions 
in connection with several acquisitions by the company during fiscal that were accounted for as poolings of interests  the company incurred million in expenses  primarily investment banking and professional service fees related to the transactions 
interest income 
interest income is generated from the license of software pursuant to installment contracts for process design software and the investment of excess cash in short term investments 
under these installment contracts  the company offers customers the option to make annual payments for its term licenses instead of a single license fee payment at the beginning of the license term 
a substantial majority of the process design modeling customers elect to license these products through installment contracts 
the company believes this election is made principally because the customers prefer to pay for the company s process design software out of their operating budgets  rather than out of their capital budgets 
included in the annual payments is an implicit interest established by the company at the time of the license 
the company sells a portion of the installment contracts to unrelated financial institutions 
the interest earned by the company on the installment contract portfolio in any one year is the result of the implicit interest established by the company on installment contracts and the size of the contract portfolio 
interest income was million for fiscal as compared to million in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense is generated from interest charged on the company s bank line of credit and capital lease obligations 
interest expense in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate in fiscal is calculated as a percentage of income before taxes  exclusive of the non recurring charges for in process research and development 
the effective tax rate decreased for fiscal to of pre tax income from for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to utilization of foreign loss carrybacks  foreign tax credits  and research and development credits 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal the company acquired dmcc and setpoint in the third quarter of fiscal in transactions accounted for as purchases 
the combined operations of dmcc and setpoint at the time of acquisitions were roughly the same size as aspentech 
as a result  the company s results of operations for fiscal and fiscal are not directly comparable 
revenues 
total revenues for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal software license revenues represented and of total revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
revenues from software licenses in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal the growth in software license revenues was attributable both to internal growth in existing operations and to additional licenses entered into by the acquired subsidiaries 
the internal growth in software license revenues was attributable to renewals of software licenses covering existing users  the expansion of existing customer relationships through licenses covering additional users and additional software products  and  to a lesser extent  the addition of new customers 
the decrease in software license revenues as a percentage of total revenues was attributable to the growth of service revenues resulting from the company s acquisitions of dmcc and setpoint 
total revenues from customers outside the united states were million or of total revenues and million or of total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
since the acquisitions of dmcc and setpoint  the company has generated a significantly greater amount of revenues from services

cost of software licenses 
cost of software licenses in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal cost of software licenses as a percentage of revenues from software licenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal this decrease was due to the spreading of fixed production and delivery costs over a larger revenue base and to the generation of a greater portion of sales having minimal third party royalty costs

the effective tax rate in fiscal and fiscal is calculated as a percentage of income before taxes  exclusive of the non recurring charges for in process research and development 
the effective tax rate decreased in fiscal to of pre tax income from in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to utilization of various tax credits and carryforwards 
quarterly results the company s operating results and cash flow have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  including purchasing patterns  timing of introductions of new solutions and enhancements by the company and its competitors  and fluctuating economic conditions 
because license fees for the company s software products are substantial and the implementation of the company s solutions often requires the services of the company s engineers over an extended period of time  the sales process for the company s solutions is lengthy and can exceed one year 
accordingly  software revenue is difficult to predict  and the delay of any order could cause the company s quarterly revenues to fall substantially below expectations 
moreover  to the extent that the company succeeds in shifting customer purchases away from point solutions and toward integrated suites of its software and service solutions  the likelihood of delays in ordering may increase and the effect of any delay may become more pronounced 
the company ships software products within a short period after receipt of an order and usually does not have a material backlog of unfilled orders of software products 
consequently  revenues from software licenses in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
historically  a majority of each quarter s revenues from software licenses has been derived from license agreements that have been consummated in the final weeks of the quarter 
therefore  even a short delay in the consummation of an agreement may cause revenues to fall below expectations for that quarter 
since the company s expense levels are based in part on anticipated revenues  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any revenue shortfall and any revenue shortfalls would likely have a disproportionately adverse effect on net income 
the company expects that these factors will continue to affect its operating results for the foreseeable future 
prior to fiscal  the company experienced a net loss for the first quarter of each fiscal year  in part because a substantial portion of the company s total revenues is derived from countries other than the united states where business is slow during the summer months and also in part because of the timing of renewals of software licenses 
although the company has generated a profit for the first quarter of each of fiscal and fiscal  the company expects that it will continue to experience declines in total revenues and net income in the first fiscal quarter as compared to the immediately preceding fiscal quarter 
because of the foregoing factors  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance
