item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview total revenues for gartner group inc the company for fiscal were million  up from million for fiscal current year revenue growth consisted of a increase in advisory excluding consulting and measurement services  a decrease in learning revenue and a increase in other revenue  principally from consulting services and conferences 
advisory and measurement services encompass products which  on an ongoing basis  highlight industry developments  review new products and technologies  provide quantitative market research  analyze industry trends within a particular technology or market sector and provide comparative analysis of the information technology operations of organizations 
the company enters into annually renewable contracts for advisory and measurement services 
revenues from advisory and measurement services and learning are recognized as products and services are delivered and as the company s obligation to the client is completed over the contract period 
revenue increases in advisory and measurement services and other revenue came from the combined successes of numerous new product introductions and delivery platforms  sales penetration into new and existing clients and incremental revenue from acquisitions 
the decrease in learning revenue is primarily the result of the sale of gartnerlearning during the fourth quarter of fiscal contract value increased to approximately million at september  versus the same date last year when excluding contract value related to gartnerlearning 
the company believes that contract value  which is calculated as the annualized value of all advisory and measurement contracts in effect at a given point in time  without regard to the duration of such contracts outstanding at such time  is a significant measure of the company s volume of business 
historically  the company has experienced that a substantial portion of client companies have renewed these services for an equal or higher level of total payments each year  and  to date  annual revenues from these services in any fiscal year have approximated contract value at the beginning of the fiscal year 
as of september   approximately of the company s clients have renewed one or more of these services in the last twelve months 
however  this renewal rate is not necessarily indicative of the rate of retention of the company s revenue base  and contract value at any time may not be indicative of future advisory and measurement revenues or cash flows if the rate of renewal of advisory and measurement services or the timing of new business were to significantly change during the following twelve months compared to historic patterns 
total deferred revenues of million and million as of september  and  respectively  as presented in the company s consolidated balance sheets  represent unamortized revenues from billed advisory and measurement and including learning until gartnerlearning was sold plus unamortized revenues of certain other billed products and services not included in advisory and measurement services 
deferred revenues do not directly correlate to contract value as of the same date since contract value represents an annualized value of all outstanding contracts without regard to the duration of such contracts  and deferred revenue represents unamortized revenue remaining on all outstanding and billed contracts including advisory and measurement services and certain other products and services not included in advisory and measurement revenue 
backlog at september  was approximately million and represents future revenues that will be recognized on multi year and early renewed advisory and measurement contracts and in process consulting engagements 
such revenues will be recognized when services and products are delivered 
backlog is not included in deferred revenues or contract value 
historically  the company has realized significant renewals and growth in contract value at the end of quarters 
the fourth quarter of the fiscal year typically is the fastest growth quarter for contract value and the first quarter of the fiscal year typically represents the slowest growth quarter as it is the quarter in which the largest amount of contact renewals are due 
as a result of the quarterly trends in contract value and overall business volume  fees receivable  deferred revenues  deferred commissions and commissions payable reflect this activity and typically show substantial increases at quarter end  particularly at fiscal year end 
all contracts are billable upon signing  absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time 
all contracts are non cancelable and non refundable  except for government contracts which have a day cancellation clause  but have not produced material cancellations to date 
the company s policy is to record at the time of signing of an advisory and measurement contract the entire amount of the contract billable as deferred revenue and fees receivable 
the company also records the related commission obligation upon the signing of the contract and amortizes the corresponding deferred commission expense over the contract period in which the related advisory and measurement revenues are earned and amortized to income 
historically  advisory and measurement revenues have increased in the first quarter of the ensuing fiscal year over the immediately preceding quarter primarily due to the amount of increase in contract value at the end of the prior fiscal year 
other revenues have increased similarly due to annual conferences and exhibition events held in the first quarter 
additionally  operating income margin operating income as a percentage of total revenues typically improves in the first quarter of the fiscal year versus the immediately preceding quarter 
the operating income margin improvement in the first quarter of the fiscal year is due in part by the increase in advisory and measurement revenue upon which the company is able to further leverage its selling  general and administrative expenses  plus operating income generated from the first quarter symposium and itxpo exhibition events 
operating income margin generally is not as high in remaining quarters  especially the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year compared to the first quarter of the fiscal year as the operating income margins from the itxpo conferences in the first fiscal quarter are higher than on conferences held later in the fiscal year 
additionally  the company historically does not increase its level of spending until after the first quarter of the fiscal year  when the rate of growth in contract value becomes known 
as a result  growth in operating expenses has typically lagged behind growth in revenues within a given year  and operating income margin has generally been higher in the earlier quarters of the fiscal year 
operating income rose to million in fiscal  or of total revenues  from million  or of total revenues in fiscal during fiscal  the company recorded two one time costs that reduced reported operating income 
the first was an acquisition related charge of million from the write off of purchased in process research and development costs in connection with the acquisition of interpose inc the second was nonrecurring charges of million relating to costs associated with the relocation of certain accounting and order processing functions to new facilities 
excluding these charges  operating income for fiscal increased to million  compared to the prior year and was of total revenue for fiscal operating income  excluding the charges  has increased as a result of solid revenue growth coupled with controlled spending that has allowed the company to gain economies of scale through the leveraging of its resources additional revenues have been generated using essentially the same resources 
the company s continued focus on margin improvement has favorably impacted operating results 
diluted net income per common share was in fiscal as compared to last fiscal year s per common share 
excluding acquisition related and nonrecurring charges and the loss on sale of gartnerlearning  diluted net income per common share was  a increase compared to fiscal the company s strong cash generation also continued in fiscal the company had million in total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at september   up million from million at september  analysis of operations the following table sets forth certain results of operations as a percentage of revenues fiscal year ended september  percent of revenues revenues advisory and measurement learning other  principally consulting and conferences total revenues costs and expenses cost of services and product development selling  general and administrative acquisition related charges nonrecurring charges depreciation amortization of intangibles total costs and expenses operating income minority interest loss on sale of gartnerlearning interest income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income fiscal year ended september  versus fiscal year ended september  total revenues increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal revenues from advisory excluding consulting and measurement services increased in fiscal to million compared to million in fiscal and comprised approximately and of total revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
revenue from the learning business decreased in fiscal to compared to in fiscal and comprised approximately of revenues in fiscal versus in fiscal the increase in revenues from advisory and measurement services reflects the continued client acceptance of new products and services  sales penetration into new and existing clients and incremental revenue from acquisitions completed in fiscal and fiscal primarily datapro information services  inc 
the decrease in learning revenue is primarily the result of the sale of gartnerlearning in the fourth quarter of fiscal other revenues  consisting principally of revenues from consulting services and conferences increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in the prior year 
the increase is primarily attributable to the company s symposia conferences and itxpo exhibition events held annually during the first quarter of the fiscal year  revenue from new events and acquired businesses as well as increased consulting revenues 
the rate of growth in advisory and measurement revenues has continued to be strong in two of the three defined geographic market areas of the company the united states and europe 
revenues from sales to united states clients increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal revenues from sales to european clients increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal sales to other international clients  primarily in the asian and south american markets areas  have decreased slightly by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was caused primarily by unfavorable exchange rate impact and client concerns over the financial crisis in asia 
the company s sales strategy continues to be to extend the company s sales channels to clients with revenues ranging from million to billion  in addition to the company s historic focus on larger customers 
in europe and the other international markets  additional investment in direct sales personnel and distributor relationships has also contributed to overall revenue growth 
the company intends to continue its expansion of operations outside of the united states in fiscal operating income increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal excluding acquisition related and nonrecurring charges  operating income in fiscal increased 
the united states and europe geographic areas experienced growth in operating income in fiscal  with an and increase  respectively 
the other international geographic areas experienced a slight decline in operating income in fiscal of 
operating income  as a percentage of total revenues was for fiscal and  after excluding the above mentioned charges 
operating income has increased as a result of solid revenue growth coupled with controlled spending that has allowed the company to gain economies of scale through the leveraging of its resources additional revenues have been generated using essentially the same resources 
the company s continued focus on margin improvement has favorably impacted operating results 
costs and expenses  excluding acquisition related and nonrecurring charges  increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and was of total revenues in both fiscal years 
cost of services and product development expenses were million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
this increase in expenses over the prior fiscal year reflects the need to provide additional support to the growing client base  costs associated with acquired business and continued product development costs 
the decrease in cost of services and product development expenses  as a percentage of total revenues is primarily attributable to improved gross margins on conferences  lower delivery cost per dollar of revenue due to increased electronic delivery of products  as well as controlled discretionary spending and reduced variable costs linked to financial performance 
selling  general and administrative expenses  which were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  increased as a result of the company s continuing expansion of worldwide distribution channels and resulting commissions earned on the revenue generated 
this increase is primarily the result of continued expansion of worldwide distribution channels and the impact of acquisitions 
although the company has added general and administrative resources to support the growing revenue base  selling  general and administrative expenses has remained consistent at of total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  the company incurred one time charges that were reflected in costs and expenses 
in february  the company acquired the net assets of interpose inc interpose  a provider of total cost of ownership measurement and analysis tools and training 
in connection with the acquisition  the company recorded an acquisition related charge of million for the write off of purchased in process research and development costs 
on december   the company revised the amount of expensed purchased in process research and development costs from million to million 
the change was in response to recently developed guidance from the securities and exchange commission 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company recorded nonrecurring charges  primarily consisting of relocation and severance costs  totaling approximately million related to the company s relocation of certain accounting and order processing operations from stamford  connecticut to a new financial services center in ft 
myers  florida 
depreciation expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily due to capital spending required to support business growth 
additionally  amortization of intangibles increased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  reflecting primarily goodwill associated with fiscal and acquisitions 
on september   the company sold gartnerlearning  a division of the company that provided technology based training and services to netg inc netg  a subsidiary of harcourt brace company  for million in cash and an equity interest in netg 
in addition  the company received a put option which allows the company to sell its interest to an affiliate of harcourt brace company for million in cash 
this put option may be exercised for two years beginning on september  if certain conditions are met 
the company s interest in netg has an independently appraised value of million 
including related transaction costs of million  the pre tax loss on sale of gartnerlearning was approximately million 
interest income  net increased to million in fiscal  versus million for fiscal this improvement resulted from interest income accumulating on higher balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities million at september   versus million at september  
provision for income taxes increased by or million to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal the effective tax rate was and for fiscal and  respectively 
as a result of the sale of gartnerlearning  additional taxes of million were incurred  primarily due to the reversal of non deductible goodwill 
excluding these additional taxes  the company s effective rate for fiscal was  a decrease of two percentage points from fiscal this decrease is due primarily to on going tax planning initiatives 
a more detailed analysis of the changes in the provision for income taxes is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
fiscal year ended september  versus fiscal year ended september  total revenues increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal revenues from advisory excluding consulting and measurement services increased in fiscal to million compared to million in fiscal and comprised approximately of total revenues in both fiscal and fiscal revenue from learning increased in fiscal to compared to in fiscal and comprised approximately of revenues in fiscal versus in fiscal the increase in revenues from advisory measurement and learning services reflects primarily strong market acceptance of new services introduced in and the first half of  volume increases as a result of increased geographic and client penetration  continuation of a volume pricing strategy that provides more value for the same dollars each year through the expansion of electronic distribution within client companies and incremental revenues from acquisitions completed in fiscal and fiscal primarily datapro information services  inc  datapro and j learning  inc 
other revenues  consisting principally of revenues from conferences and consulting services  increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in the prior year 
the increase is primarily attributable to additional conferences held in fiscal  increased revenue versus fiscal for certain conferences and expansion of consulting services to new geographic regions 
the rate of growth in advisory  measurement and learning revenues has continued to be strong in the three defined geographic market areas of the company the united states  europe and other international 
revenues from sales to united states clients increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal revenues from sales to european clients increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and revenues from sales to other international clients increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal these increases reflect primarily the continued results of the company s sales strategy to extend the company s sales channels to clients with revenues ranging from million to billion  in addition to the company s historic focus on larger customers 
in europe and other international markets  additional investment in direct sales personnel and distributor relationships has also contributed to revenue growth 
the company intends to continue its expansion of operations outside of the united states 
operating income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal excluding million in acquisition related charges consisting primarily of a million write off of purchased in process research and development costs in connection with the acquisition of j learning corporation operating income in fiscal increased 
all three geographic areas experienced growth in operating income in fiscal  with a  and increase in the united states  europe and other international geographic areas  respectively 
operating income  as a percentage of total  increased to of revenues for fiscal versus for fiscal  revenues  after excluding the above mentioned charges 
operating income has increased as a result of solid revenue growth coupled with controlled spending that has allowed the company to gain economies of scale through the leveraging of its resources additional revenues have been generated using essentially the same resources 
the company s continued focus on margin improvement has favorably impacted operating results 
while costs and expenses  excluding acquisition related charges  increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  such costs decreased to of total revenues from in fiscal cost of services and product development expenses were million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
this increase in expenses over the prior fiscal year reflects the need to provide additional support to the growing client base  including investment in strategic areas such as electronic and internet distribution  costs associated with the implementation of the company s new client inquiry process quickpath and product development costs particularly for technology based training products 
the decrease in cost of services and product development expenses  as a percentage of total revenues is primarily attributable to improved gross margins on conferences as compared to the prior year and lower delivery cost per dollar of revenue generated due to increased electronic delivery of services and products 
selling  general and administrative expenses  which were million and million for fiscal and  respec tively  increased as a result of the company s continuing expansion of worldwide distribution channels and resulting commissions earned on the revenue generated 
the increase in commission expense was offset partially by the elimination and or reduction of redundant general and administrative expenses  including personnel reductions and facility rationalization relating to acquisitions 
although the company has added general and administrative resources to support the growing revenue base  it has benefited from economies of scale and leveraging of its general and administrative staff and facilities 
consequently  selling  general and administrative expenses were of total revenues for fiscal as compared to for fiscal acquisition related charges of million in fiscal for the acquisitions of dataquest  inc dataquest and j were not recurring in fiscal depreciation expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily due to capital spending required to support business growth 
additionally  amortization of intangibles increased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  reflecting primarily goodwill associated with fiscal and acquisitions 
interest income  net increased to million in fiscal  versus million for fiscal this improvement resulted from interest income accumulating on the company s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities million at september   versus million at september   changes in the mix of investments to higher yielding investments and from reduced interest expense after remaining debt related to fiscal and acquisitions was paid during fiscal interest rates were not a significant factor in the increase in interest income earned in fiscal versus fiscal provision for income taxes increased by million to million in fiscal  up from million in fiscal the effective rate was and for fiscal and  respectively 
absent the non deductible write off for purchased in process research and development costs  the effective tax rate for fiscal was 
the decrease in the effective tax rate from fiscal  excluding acquisition related charges  is due to on going tax planning initiatives 
a more detailed analysis of the changes in the provision for income taxes is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
proposed recapitalization  special cash dividend and share repurchase on november   the company s board of directors approved an agreement in principle with ims health inc ims health which owns million or of the company s class a common stock to undertake a recapitalization of the company and facilitate a tax free spin off by ims health of its equity position in gartner group inc to its shareholders 
as part of the recapitalization  ims health will exchange million shares of class a common stock for an equal number of shares of new class b common stock of the company prior to the spin off 
this new class of common stock will be entitled to elect at least of the company s board of directors  but will otherwise be substantially identical to existing class a common stock 
the class b common stock will be distributed to ims health shareholders in a tax free distribution 
ims health will continue to hold million shares of class a common stock after the spin off 
it is the intention of ims health to sell these shares within one year of the spin off  subject to certain conditions 
in addition  the company agreed that it would pay a one time special cash dividend of million to its shareholders of record immediately prior to the ims health spin off 
further  the company also agreed that it would repurchase million of its class a common stock on the open market after the spin off 
the exchange  spin off and special cash dividend are expected to be completed in the third quarter of fiscal  subject to approval by the irs of the tax free status of the spin off and approval of the recapitalization plan by the non ims health shareholders of the company 
the share repurchase program will commence after the spin off and is expected to be completed within one year 
factors that may affect future performance the company s future operating results will depend upon the company s ability to continue to compete successfully in the market for information products and services 
the company faces competition from a significant number of independent providers of similar services  as well as the internal marketing and planning organizations of the company s clients 
the company also competes indirectly against other information providers  including electronic and print media companies and consulting firms 
in addition  there are limited barriers to entry into the company s market and additional new competitors could readily emerge 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to provide the products and services that meet client needs as the information technology it market rapidly evolves  or that the company can otherwise continue to compete successfully 
in this regard  the company s ability to compete is largely dependent upon the quality of its staff of it analysts 
competition for qualified analysts is intense 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to hire additional qualified it analysts as may be required to support the evolving needs of customers or any growth in the company s business 
any failure to maintain a premier staff of it analysts could adversely affect the quality of the company s products and services  and therefore its future business and operating results 
additionally  there may be increased business risk as the company expands product and service offerings to smaller domestic companies 
the company s operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international sales  including changes in market demand as a result of exchange rate fluctuations  tariffs and other barriers  challenges in staffing and managing foreign sales operations  and higher levels of taxation on foreign income than domestic income 
further expansion would also require additional management attention and financial resources 
liquidity and capital resources the company has primarily financed its operations to date through cash provided by operating activities 
the combination of revenue growth and operating margin improvements have contributed to increases in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal  and in addition  cash flow has been enhanced by the company s continuing management of working capital requirements to support increased sales volumes from growth in the pre existing businesses and growth due to acquisitions 
cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was million  compared to million in the prior fiscal year  reflecting primarily the impact of increased operating income and changes in balance sheet accounts  particularly fees receivable  deferred revenues  deferred commissions and prepaid and other current assets 
cash used for investing activities totaled million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal during fiscal  the company used million in cash for acquisitions  primarily for the purchase of vision events international inc for million  interpose for million and the research board inc for million 
additionally  the company used million for investments in unconsolidated businesses 
the company also used million for the purchase of capital assets and had net purchases of marketable securities for million 
cash provided by financing activities totaled million in fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the increase in fiscal is driven primarily by a million credit to additional paid in capital for tax benefits received from stock transactions with employees and million from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of employee stock options 
the tax benefit of stock transactions with employees is due to a reduction in the corporate income tax liability based on an imputed compensation deduction equal to employees gain upon the exercise of stock options at an exercise price below fair market 
as additional stock options have become exercisable each fiscal year under the company s stock option plans  the volumes of option exercises have increased  thereby resulting in significant tax benefits being realized in both fiscal and these increases were partially offset by a net cash settlement of million on a forward purchase agreement on the company s common stock and million for the purchase of treasury stock 
the effect of exchange rates reduced cash and cash equivalents by million for the year ended september   and was due to the strengthening of the us dollar versus certain foreign currencies 
in fiscal the effect of exchange rates reduced cash and cash equivalents by million 
at september   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million 
in addition  the company has available two unsecured credit lines with the bank of new york and chase manhattan bank for million and million  respectively 
these lines may be cancelled by the banks at any time without prior notice or penalty 
additionally  the company issues letters of credit in the ordinary course of business 
the company had outstanding letters of credit with chase manhattan bank of million and million with the bank of new york at september  the company believes that its current cash balances and maturing marketable debt securities  together with cash anticipated to be provided by operating activities and borrowings available under the existing lines of credit  will be sufficient for the expected short term cash needs of the company  including possible acquisitions 
additionally as mentioned above  the company is seeking a recapitalization that when completed would require a significant amount of cash to fund the special dividend and the repurchase of common shares 
the company believes that current cash balances and maturing marketable debt securities  expected cash to be generated from operations and the company s ability to borrow beyond the current lines of credit  will be sufficient to provide the liquidity required 
the company currently has no other material capital commitments

prior to september   it was listed on the nasdaq national market 
the company effected two for one stock splits by means of stock dividends on march   june  and august  all earnings per share and share data presented herein have been restated retroactively to reflect such splits 
as of september   the company recorded the conversion of all class b common stock into class a common stock on a one for one basis  pursuant to a provision of the articles of incorporation which required conversion when the class b common stockholder s voting equity fell below a certain ownership percentage after considering all exercisable options and warrants outstanding

quarterly common stock prices fiscal year fiscal year high low high low first quarter ended december second quarter ended march third quarter ended june fourth quarter ended september as of september   the company has not paid any cash dividends on its common stock 
as discussed above  the agreement in principal to recapitalize the company includes a special one time cash dividend of million which will be paid to shareholders of record immediately prior to the planned spin off by ims health 
except for this proposed special one time cash dividend  which is subject to certain irs and shareholder approvals  the company currently intends to retain future earnings for use in its business and does not anticipate that any additional cash dividends will be declared or paid on the common stock in the foreseeable future 
year issues the year problem results from the fact that many technology systems have been designed using only a two digit representation of the year portion of the date 
this has the potential to cause errors or failures in those systems that depend on correct interpretation of the year  but cannot necessarily correctly interpret as the year 
there are two other issues that are generally considered part of the year problem a the fact that the year is a special case leap year and b certain dates over the next few years  such as  could be misinterpreted as codes with special meanings  such as means an invalid record this is a simple description of the most common cause of the year problem 
there are many complete descriptions  with examples  such as the year guide for practitioners 
the problem can manifest itself before  on or after january  the year problem has often been described as a computer problem  but there is a growing recognition that the issue extends far beyond conventional computers and affects virtually every facet of a modern company s operations and interfaces with third parties 
the company s year efforts are organized around understanding and addressing the business critical functions in each of the six major areas that could potentially be affected by year issues business critical functions are defined as those whose failure or significant disruption would have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations or involve a safety risk to employees or customers supply chain suppliers  customers  financial affiliates  and government agencies products services goods created by the company for its customers information technology it applications in house and vendor business computer programs it infrastructure computers  communications and call center systems non it process systems systems used to create and deliver the company s products services non it facilities systems systems used to monitor and control the company s places of work and office equipment while the potential ramifications of the year issue are significant  the company believes that it is taking full advantage of its internal resources and all necessary external resources to understand  identify and correct all year issues within its control 
the company recognizes that there are significant unknowns  hence potential risks  that are outside its control and will also take all reasonable steps to minimize the impact of those exposures 
the company has made available timely information on the status of year efforts to its employees and on the status of products to its customers 
in the absence of significant factors outside its control  the company expects to be fully prepared to meet the year with minimal  if any  impact to its employees and customers 
the company expects to have made all essential it and non it systems year ready before their known failure dates or january   whichever is sooner 
all products of the company are  or are expected to be  year ready before their known failure dates or by january   whichever is sooner  and should any date related problems be revealed after that point  they will be fixed at no extra charge to the customer or replaced with a product of equal value 
the company has established a global inquiry response process to ensure timely  clear  consistent  accurate and documented responses to all requests for information about its products and services 
the company further expects to take all prudent and reasonable steps to validate the year readiness of its direct supply chain interfaces  but believes that this area does and will continue to represent a significant level of uncertainty and business risk at least through the first half of the year if a significant portion of the supply chain suffers year related business disruption  there could be a material impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s definition for year readiness is a definition of year conformity requirements published by the british standards institution disc pd 
expectations for a successful outcome are based on the incorporation of a number of best practices in addressing the year problem 
the company has a formal global year program office  headed by the chief information officer who reports directly to the president and staffed by a core project team of senior managers with representatives from key worldwide business units 
year remediation work is being performed by a combination of in house and vendor personnel  which is consistent with normal business operations 
year progress and issues are reviewed regularly with some or all of the senior management team  including legal counsel  and the audit committee to ensure timely and appropriate management attention 
general employee communication programs are increasing 
the program office is using a compliance reporting and risk assessment methodology which provides a classification system and checklist with domains including it infrastructure  applications and procedures  process systems  facilities and equipment  products and services  and supply chains 
the methodology uses the combined insights and knowledge bases from gartner group s research  benchmarking and consulting organizations 
the company has established standards for compliance  date testing  document retention and contingency plans 
the company has begun a formal prioritization and communication program with all material suppliers to ascertain their readiness 
all significant company products have or will undergo testing to determine their ability to function correctly according to date testing standards 
the core suite of accounting  finance  and human resources applications have been replaced by year compliant vendor packages 
the remaining key in house developed applications have been analyzed for potential date problems and are in the process of being remediated 
many components of the it infrastructure  non it process systems and non it facilities systems have been replaced or upgraded 
it is believed that all of the remaining non compliant key components have been identified and these are planned for replacement or upgrade in accordance with normal maintenance schedules 
the company has used standard cost accounting principles where possible  activity based costing to assign costs to year activities 
the company expects to establish a separate year account to budget and track significant fiscal year expenditures 
all maintenance and modification costs are expensed as incurred  while the cost of new systems is being capitalized according to generally accepted accounting principles 
identified year expenses amounted to million in fiscal and are forecast to be million in fiscal these costs are predominantly for the budgeted replacement or upgrades of it and non it systems  but also include pro rated personnel standard unit costs 
these estimates do not include the company s potential share of year costs that may be incurred in relation to recent acquisitions 
the need to replace or upgrade systems and applications subject to year errors had been anticipated and factored into regular improvements of the company s it and non it technological environment 
as a result  the source of funding for year remediation efforts is expected to be predominantly from cash flow from operations and  perhaps  in a few isolated incidences from the short term deferral of other discretionary projects 
the company has not incurred and does not expect any material impact to future earnings or financial condition as a result of year repair or replacement activities 
the company has examined the business impact associated with each of the six major areas described above 
the company believes that it has limited products and services exposure due to the nature of those products and services  as well as efforts expended to date 
the area of potential greatest risk is the supply chain 
this risk is somewhat mitigated by the diverse and distributed characteristics of both its suppliers and customers and the fact that the company has no material single vendor source suppliers 
the company has contacted key suppliers and customers to ascertain year readiness  through questionnaires and or personal follow up  as appropriate 
the company has developed a reasonably likely worst case scenario based on exploring a wide range of possible results from year problems note it is expected that there is a relatively small probability that the reasonably likely worst case scenario would actually occur 
the company believes that this scenario would be the result of a general economic downturn coupled with sporadic problems with basic infrastructure services 
this scenario would probably affect the company s revenues and could change demand for services note there is also a possibility for increased demand for the company s services related to the year 
the company has begun the process of identifying potential variants of this scenario and expects to develop business contingencies to deal with these situations 
other undiscovered issues related to the year issue have the potential for an adverse impact on the company s financial condition 
the company plans to carefully monitor developments with key third party organizations  to identify alternatives as needed and to promote the integrity of the supply chain through information sharing as appropriate
