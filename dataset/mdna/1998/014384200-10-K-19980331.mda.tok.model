item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview business conditions aldila  inc the company is principally in the business of designing  manufacturing and marketing graphite carbon fiber based composite golf club shafts  with approximately of its net sales resulting from sales to golf club manufacturers for inclusion in their clubs 
as a result  the company s operating results are substantially dependent not only on demand by its customers for the company s shafts  but also on demand by consumers for clubs including graphite shafts such as the company s 
early in  the company expects to begin production of carbon fiber at its new facility in evanston  wyoming 
the company will use the output of this facility to satisfy a significant portion of its internal demand for carbon fiber in the manufacturing of golf club shafts 
it also anticipates that it will produce at this new facility carbon fiber in excess of what it will be able to use in the manufacturing of golf club shafts 
the company intends to sell such excess  in some cases in the form of graphite prepreg manufactured using its existing facility in poway  california  to other manufacturers of carbon fiber based products 
the company is also exploring entering into the manufacture of new carbon fiber based products in order to take advantage of this excess carbon fiber capacity and may make acquisitions of other companies in order to acquire such product lines 
the company expects that the additional vertical integration offered by its new facility will assist it from the outset in maintaining its position as a low cost manufacturer of graphite golf club shafts at all price points 
management of the company believes that the ability to manufacture carbon fiber will also ultimately enable the company to diversify its sales and reduce its dependence on the overall golf club market  while continuing to leverage the company s existing composite materials expertise  which should provide opportunities for growth that are not currently present in the golf shaft business 
this new facility will need to undergo a shakedown period and will not be operating at full capacity initially  therefore  the full benefit of this facility to the company is not expected to be realized until at least historically  graphite shafts have principally been offered by manufacturers of higher priced  premium golf clubs  and the company s sales have been predominantly of premium graphite shafts 
in addition  until recently  the united states market for graphite shafts was dominated by a relatively small number of united states based shaft manufacturers 
both of these aspects of the graphite shaft market have been changing 
as a high percentage of premium clubs are already sold with graphite shafts  as compared to a smaller percentage of value priced clubs  the company anticipates that growth in graphite shaft usage in the future will be greater in the value priced segment of the market than in the premium segment 
management of the company expects sales of shafts for the value priced club market to increase significantly over the next several years  although management also anticipates that sales of premium shafts will continue to represent a majority of the company s sales measured in dollars for the foreseeable future 
over the last several years  the number of shaft manufacturers of graphite golf shafts serving the united states premium club market has increased  including affiliates of foreign manufacturers that had previously not had significant sales in the united states 
these two overall trends in the graphite shaft marketplace have had the effect  and are expected by management to continue to have the effect for at least the next several years  of decreasing the average selling price of the company s shafts 
although the company s gross profit margin is being adversely affected by the reduction in average selling price and continuing increases in raw material costs  these adverse effects on gross margin should be mitigated to some extent by efforts being taken by the company to control costs  including manufacturing its own graphite prepreg and  starting in its own carbon fiber  increased automation and increasing the percentage of its shafts being manufactured in countries with lower labor and overhead costs 
in recent years  the company s results of operations have been materially affected on several occasions by dramatic year to year changes in sales to an individual golf club manufacturer customer 
such changes can result either from decisions by the customer to increase or decrease shaft purchases from an alternative supplier or from the traditional volatility in consumer demand for specific clubs 
the company believes that this volatility is likely to continue in the future  particularly as club manufacturers seek to gain competitive advantages through an increased rate of technological innovation in club design 
the company s results will benefit whenever it has an opportunity to supply shafts for the latest hot club and will be adversely affected whenever sales of clubs containing aldila shafts drop dramatically 
in particular  in recent years  a significant portion of the company s sales has tended to be concentrated in one or two customers  thereby making the company s results of operations dependent to a large extent on continued sales to those customers 
in  sales to callaway golf company and taylor made golf represented and  respectively  of the company s total net sales 
the company expects callaway and taylor made to continue to be the company s largest customers at least through the company believes that while it will often not be possible to predict  with any certainty  shifts in demand for particular clubs  the company s broad range of club manufacturer customers should reduce in some cases the extent of the impact on the company s financial results

see notes to consolidated financial statements  note selling  general and administrative expense increased to million or of net sales in from million or of net sales in primarily as a result of increased administrative expenses in as compared to and as a result of approximately in start up costs recorded in the fourth quarter of related to the company s new carbon fiber manufacturing facility

cash including cash equivalents provided by operating activities in was million compared to million in this decrease resulted principally from the decrease in net income and increase in inventory in as compared to the company used million for capital expenditures during  primarily related to development and construction of a new facility for the manufacture of carbon fiber 
the design  construction and start up of the  square foot facility that was completed in the first quarter of will have a total cost of approximately million 
the company has used existing cash and cash provided by operating activities to fund the project 
the company may from time to time consider the acquisition of businesses complementary to the company s business 
the company could require additional debt financing if it were to engage in a material acquisition in the future 
on october  the board of directors of the company authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of the company s common stock

the company does not believe that it will incur a material financial impact from the risk  or from assessing the risk  arising from the year issues 
seasonality because the company s customers have historically built inventory in anticipation of purchases by golfers in the spring and summer  the principal selling season for golf equipment  the company s operating results have been affected by seasonal demand for golf clubs  which has generally resulted in higher sales in the second and third quarters 
the timing of customers new products introductions has frequently mitigated the impact of seasonality in recent years
