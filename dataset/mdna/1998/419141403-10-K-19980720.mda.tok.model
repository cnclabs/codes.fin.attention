natural ingredients nutraceuticals today  virtually all guaranteed potency and standardized herbal extract products are purchased from a small number of large suppliers  located mostly in europe and china 
hauser s strongest competition in the nutraceuticals market comes from europe  in particular indena pharmaceuticals  muggenburg  schwabe  and finzelburg 
these european competitors sell bulk products directly or through agents or partners in the us some have warehousing and distribution in the us there are several us companies that sell product into the nutraceuticals market  including pureworld  east earth herb and triarco 
while all competitors manufacture standardized extracts  none produce products that contain the natural ratio assay that the company provides 
in general  these competitors are larger than hauser  have more years of experience  and established product lines 
management believes that the company s expertise in the production of special products from natural sources and its extensive regulatory experience position it well in this market area and that the company can be a strong competitor in this market now and in the foreseeable future 
sales from these products in fiscal increased over fiscal natural flavor extracts the company markets natural flavor extracts under hauser s brand name naturenhance

flavor extracts 
the company is marketing its flavor extracts directly to flavor houses  as well as to food and beverage companies through its exclusive distribution contract with rfi 
competition for products in the flavor extract market is based on flavor quality and concentration  availability  customer service  and price 
many of these factors are beyond the direct control of the company 
the company is competing with other natural extract manufacturers which include kalsec  folexco  and chart  and with flavor houses which produce their own natural extracts internally  such as mccormick and international flavors and fragrances

technical services the market for technical services in the united states is large  diverse and highly fragmented 
the company competes with various companies depending on the specific type of services provided 
competition is based primarily on quality and breadth of service 
the company s competitive position depends on its ability to attract and retain scientific and other personnel  its ability to maintain the proprietary nature of its technologies  as well as its ability to implement expanded production plans 
pharmaceuticals for discussion of the company s two contracts to supply bulk paclitaxel  reference is made to part  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form k annual report 
paclitaxel united states paclitaxel  currently marketed by bristol under their trademark taxol 
registered trademark  is used to treat metastatic breast and ovarian cancers that have not responded to first line therapies 
bristol has enjoyed market exclusivity in the united states for taxol 
registered trademark 
pursuant to provisions of the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of  commonly referred to as the waxman hatch act 
this legislation provided bristol with marketing exclusivity through provisions that barred the fda from accepting paclitaxel its abbreviated new drug application anda for filing until december  in july  immunex corporation hauser s customer through ahp received the first approval to market a competing paclitaxel product in north america from the health protection branch in canada 
boehringer ingelheim canada ltd  has acquired canadian marketing rights for immunex s paclitaxel injection product and is responsible for product distribution 
in canada  the only approved and available paclitaxel product that is competitive to taxol 
registered trademark 
is paclitaxel injection 
the bulk paclitaxel for the immunex paclitaxel injection is supplied by hauser 
immunex has announced that the fda had accepted for review its anda for generic paclitaxel injection 
a provision of the waxman hatch act permits a competitor to file an anda after four years of exclusivity if the application contains a paragraph iv patent certification 
two patents issued to bristol relating to paclitaxel provide the basis for immunex s early filing 
the immunex anda  submitted on august   and accepted for review on october   contains a certification by immunex  known as a paragraph iv certification that us patents  and  held by bristol and relating to taxol 
registered trademark 
are invalid and not infringed by the immunex paclitaxel product 
in january  immunex was sued by bristol in the us district court in newark  new jersey  alleging infringement by immunex of the two us patents pertaining to taxol 
registered trademark 
the legal action by bristol was anticipated by immunex and hauser 
as a result of the litigation  the fda has the right to withhold clearance of immunex s anda until the earlier of june  or until a court enters final judgment finding the patents invalid  unenforceable or not infringed 
as a result  immunex  hauser s customer  will not be able to sell paclitaxel in the us until the generic approval issue is resolved 
on june   immunex announced that they will collaborate with ivx bioscience  inc ivx  to market paclitaxel products in the united states  subject to fda approval 
ivx agreed to acquire the immunex anda for generic paclitaxel 
ivx will also acquire immunex s inventories of bulk paclitaxel 
the company is currently in discussions with ahp  immunex and ivx with regard to its role in the future supply of paclitaxel 
paclitaxel europe the company and its customer  yew tree had been named in a lawsuit filed by bristol in the netherlands  alleging patent infringement in europe 
on july   the district court in the netherlands ruled against bristol in this proceeding denying bristol s request for an injunction to stop yew tree from selling their product while the patent validity was determined 
subsequent to this result  bristol appealed the court s findings  and the case has now been settled in favor of yew tree 
the legal actions initiated by bristol in the united states and elsewhere could substantially reduce the market for the company s paclitaxel based products 
the company believes that these actions by bristol will not be successful 
however  if the courts uphold bristol s position  the company s investment in paclitaxel related assets  including inventory of paclitaxel valued by the company as of april  at  may be significantly delayed and subject to significant revaluation 
many of the competitors of the company s pharmaceutical business unit have significantly greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing and other resources than hauser 
in addition  the company may become subject to competition from existing or potential customers that could develop extraction and purification capabilities internally 
the company s paclitaxel processing business could be adversely affected long term new drug approval averages years by the successful development of competing sources or processes for the production of paclitaxel  or the development of paclitaxel related substances  such as simpler compounds with the activity of paclitaxel or paclitaxel prodrugs compounds which are not themselves drugs but are converted into drugs in the body 
there is a major effort underway to develop alternative raw materials for paclitaxel 
worldwide  many groups of scientists are seeking means to obtain paclitaxel from alternative renewable resources 
some of these companies and research institutions have developed and patented processes for producing paclitaxel in plant cell tissue culture and semi synthesis 
competition from other potential anti tumor compounds will be based on  among other things  product efficacy  safety  reliability  availability  price  time to market  and fda approval 
significance of dependence upon a few customers dependence upon one or several customers has material significance only to the company s pharmaceuticals business unit 
ahp hauser believes that  through its agreement with ahp  the company will be able to take advantage of ahp s expertise in clinical testing  sales  marketing and distribution for the company s paclitaxel products 
ahp owns a majority interest in immunex  and bulk paclitaxel is actually supplied to immunex under the agreement between the company and ahp 
the company has supplied immunex with bulk paclitaxel for its development needs  including final product formulation and clinical trials 
in addition  immunex has fulfilled the first stage of minimum purchase agreements required over the first three years of the ahp contract 
the second stage of the ahp contract will consist of subsequent payments made to the company in the form of a royalty  when immunex sells finished products which contain bulk paclitaxel 
there can be no assurance  however  that ahp will succeed in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals to market paclitaxel in the united states or elsewhere  although approval was obtained to sell generic paclitaxel in canada as of july  according to industry sources  the total annual market for paclitaxel in canada is about million 
in addition  there can be no assurance that ahp or immunex will market paclitaxel successfully 
while ahp has purchased minimum quantities of bulk paclitaxel from the company as required in the contract  ahp has no obligation to purchase additional product from hauser 
see competition paclitaxel united states 
research and development a key element in hauser s business strategy is to identify and develop commercial opportunities from ideas generated both through its internal research and development r d and through its consulting and contract r d operations 
management believes that certain opportunities merit internal funding 
these research and development efforts are generally devoted to five principal areas development of new technology  application of the company s processing technology to new products  improvement of existing processes  semi synthetic preparation of existing and new biologically active compounds  and development of viable alternate raw materials for natural products extraction and purification 
recent efforts in these areas have generated new products  such as rosemary antioxidants  tttrademark  and improved processes to manufacture paclitaxel from cultivated sources 
hauser also offers consultation and contract r d in the areas of product purification and isolation  product development  and process development and optimization 
the company is currently active in supporting the drug discovery and drug development efforts of its customers in the pharmaceutical industry 
the company also provides contract r d for customers in the flavors and cosmetic industries 
management believes that such endeavors could provide hauser with future manufacturing opportunities 
the company s internally funded research and development expenditures were approximately million during fiscal years   and during fiscal  and customer sponsored r d costs were approximately   and  respectively 
the company intends to continue actively pursuing research and development efforts and these costs are likely to increase in future periods 
government regulations the company s business is subject to comprehensive regulation throughout the world 
in the united states  regulations have been established by the fda with respect to the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals  foods and flavors  environmental regulation by the us environmental protection agency epa with respect to the environment  by the us bureau of alcohol  tobacco and firearms with respect to alcohol used in flavors and research  by the colorado department of public health and environment  and by the us departments of interior and agriculture to manage and protect wildlife and forest resources 
the fda  the epa  the departments of the interior and agriculture and other governmental agencies may in the future change existing regulations or adopt additional regulations that may affect the company s ability to acquire necessary raw materials  to manufacture natural ingredients  or to develop or manufacture new products 
failure to comply with applicable laws  regulations and permits can result in injunctive actions  product seizures  damages and civil and criminal penalties 
if the company expands or changes its existing operations or proposes any new operations  it may be required to obtain additional or amended permits or authorizations 
the company is also subject to regulation under the occupational safety and health act  the toxic substances control act  the resource conservation and recovery act  the federal water pollution control act  and other federal  state  and local statutes and regulations 
the company believes it is in compliance with these and other laws in all material respects 
environmental regulations because of its ambient emissions of volatile organic compounds  some of which are considered toxic as well as flammable  all of the company s facilities are subject to the clean air act amendments phased in requirements for such sources 
emission standards  established by the epa setting the maximum achievable control technology and best achievable control technology  limit hazardous air pollutant emissions from this category of sources  require a comprehensive air emission operating permit  which has been received by the company  and include related testing and reporting requirements 
the company believes its facilities are in compliance with applicable air pollution control requirements

natural ingredients nutraceuticals nutraceutical products fit into the fda product category of dietary supplements 
this product category was established by the dshea and is separate from foods and drugs 
the dshea created a federal framework for the regulation of dietary supplements  guaranteeing consumer access to safe and beneficial products and to balanced information about their benefits 
the legislation recognized the importance of nutrition and the benefits of dietary supplements in health promotion 
it recognized that preventative health measures  including education  good nutrition  and appropriate use of safe dietary supplements can help reduce the incidence of chronic diseases and reduce long term health care expenditures 
under the dshea  dietary supplements are defined as vitamins  minerals  herbs or other botanicals  amino acids  or other dietary substances used to supplement the diet by increasing total dietary intake 
moreover  concentrates  metabolites  constituents  extracts  or any combination of these ingredients are also included in this definition 
tobacco is specifically excluded from the definition 
the dshea also states that where an ingredient is first marketed as a dietary supplement and is subsequently approved as a new drug  it can continue to be sold as a supplement unless the secretary of health and human services rules it would not be safe to do so 
conversely  an ingredient that is first approved as a new drug  or as an investigational new drug for which substantial and public clinical testing is in progress  may not be marketed as a dietary supplement unless the secretary determines it would be safe to do so under the food  drug and cosmetic act 
the dshea preserves the existing safety standards found in the food  drug and cosmetic act and provides additional safeguards to ensure that consumers are protected from products which present a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury under the conditions of use recommended or suggested in product labeling 
the bill also grants the secretary of health and human services emergency authority to remove a supplement from the marketplace if it poses an imminent hazard to public safety 
the dshea addresses dietary supplement claims and statements of nutritional support 
it establishes labeling practices regarding quality standards for supplements  including requirements concerning purity  disintegration and compositional specifications and also amends nutrition labeling and nutrient content claim requirements for dietary supplements under the nutrition labeling and education act of in addition  the dshea clarifies that the protections granted to vitamins and minerals under the proxmire amendment are extended to all dietary ingredients 
thus  dietary supplements cannot be treated as drugs solely on the basis of potency or combination 
food ingredients and flavor ingredients any products produced by the company for use in flavors or cosmetics are subject to federal and state regulations relating to grading  quality control  product branding and labeling and sanitary control 
additionally  due to alcohol content  the company s vanilla extract and other flavor extracts are regulated by the us bureau of alcohol  tobacco and firearms 
the us department of agriculture and the fda also regulate manufacture of foods and cosmetics  as do various state agencies 
pharmaceuticals paclitaxel to market and sell paclitaxel in the united states  the company s customers must demonstrate that the company manufactures paclitaxel according to current gmp 
the fda s gmp regulations require  among other things  that the company comply with certain minimum requirements in the facilities  methods  and controls used to manufacture the drug 
gmp regulations are designed to assure that the drug is safe and that it meets its purported identity  strength  quality  and purity characteristics 
the company must follow stringent record keeping requirements in manufacturing and storing finished products intended for human use 
additionally  the company has filed with the fda drug master files which describe the company s manufacturing processes 
each drug master file is kept confidential between hauser and the fda  allowing the company to keep its manufacturing processes proprietary 
as long as the company is supplying bulk paclitaxel and other bulk pharmaceuticals for products to be sold in the united states  the company s manufacturing processes will continue to be subject to ongoing fda regulation and inspections to ensure compliance with gmp 
this may be time consuming and costly 
failure to comply with these practices may render the products adulterated and could subject the company and the drug to regulatory action by the fda 
although to date the company has not experienced any significant regulatory problems under gmp  there is no assurance that regulatory problems will not occur in the future as a result of expanded production in several of its facilities  new regulations  changes in interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations or otherwise 
some states may have regulatory requirements in addition to the fda 
the company does not anticipate that complying with state regulations will pose any significant difficulties 
foreign countries may also have laws regulating drugs sold in those countries 
the company may  in the future  produce additional taxanes which will be subject to the same regulation as described above with respect to paclitaxel 
generic drugs the waxman hatch act was enacted to make more low cost generic drugs available to the public 
the waxman hatch act established an abbreviated new drug application procedure for generic drugs undergoing market approval before the fda 
the anda procedure allows generic drugs to be approved by the fda if they are shown to be the bioequivalent of an approved drug 
a drug is considered bioequivalent to an approved drug if the rate and extent of absorption of the generic drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the approved drug when administered at the same molar dose of the therapeutic ingredient under similar experimental conditions in either a single dose or multiple doses 
the anda provision eliminates the expense and delay of proving the safety and effectiveness of a generic drug in clinical tests on humans when a pioneer drug manufacturer has already proven such requirements 
under the waxman hatch act  the fda must approve the anda within days from the time of filing  if the applicant shows that the conditions for prescribed  recommended  or suggested use for the new generic drug have been previously approved for a prior drug  the generic drug has the same active ingredients as the prior approved drug  the generic drug uses the same route of administration  dosage form and strength as the approved drug  the generic drug is the bioequivalent of an approved drug  and the labeling proposed for the generic drug is the same as the labeling approved for the prior drug 
additionally  the applicant must certify that  in its opinion and to the best of its knowledge  neither the generic drug nor its use is patented  or if patented  that the patent has expired  will expire or that the patent is invalid or will not be subject to infringement 
the waxman hatch act provides that pioneer drugs receive five years of exclusive market life 
the effective date of the exclusivity period is the date of nda approval of the pioneer drug 
this provision prohibits the approval of a generic equivalent for five years 
the waxman hatch act also grants days exclusivity to the first successful supplemental nda application against future competing supplemental nda versions of the product 
product liability insurance the testing and sale of the company s products include an inherent risk that product liability claims may be asserted against the company 
in particular  the pharmaceutical industry has experienced increasing difficulty maintaining product liability insurance coverage at reasonable levels  and substantial increases in insurance premium costs have rendered coverage economically impractical in many cases 
the company has obtained million in product liability coverage 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain product liability insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance will provide adequate coverage against potential claims 
while the company has not experienced any product liability claims  if such claims should arise in the future  the company s business and prospects could be materially adversely affected

natural ingredients  which include nutraceuticals  flavors and food ingredients  increased over the prior year 
revenues from technical services increased almost over the prior year 
offsetting these improvements was a decline in pharmaceutical revenues of because of regulatory issues and uncertainty in the market for paclitaxel products 
pharmaceutical sales are largely dependent upon the company s strategic customers  and legal and regulatory issues that are out the company s control create unpredictability quarter to quarter 
the company was not profitable in fiscal  although the loss from continuing operations improved almost over the previous fiscal year 
management has completed operating plans for fiscal year ended april   and believes that the company can regain profitability in the new fiscal year  based upon achieving certain sales goals and the continuation of cost controls  however  there can be no assurance of when profitability will again be realized 
on may   the company announced the discovery of small amounts of a common fungicide called quintozene in its bulk panax ginseng that had been shipped to customers 
the company had used environmental protection agency guidelines to screen for herbicides and pesticides  but this particular fungicide was not included in the general guidelines 
the company immediately stopped all panax ginseng processing and shipments  pending further testing and discussions with regulatory authorities 
based upon test results and analytical reviews of the substance  the company believes that the levels of quintozene present in the bulk extract are well below any reasonable risk levels 
however  management does expect that the existence of this fungicide in the panax ginseng will create additional cost to the company 
as such  a charge to earnings of  was taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal in anticipation of product returns  re work costs  development work required to provide methodology to remove the substance from the bulk extracts  and legal and professional fees 
sales of panax ginseng generated less than of total revenues in fiscal  and management believes that the temporary hold on shipments of this product will not have a material impact on the future operations of the company 
when reviewing the results of operations for the company  it is important to note that significant sales momentum occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and had the aforementioned charge to earnings not been required  results for the fourth quarter would have been profitable 
on september   the company adopted plans to sell substantially all of the net assets of its secondary forest products subsidiary  hauser northwest  inc  d b a ironwood evergreens ironwood

on december   the company announced that the value of the contracts with pharmaprint is expected to be million over the next three years 
the company continues to manufacture botanical products and provides research and development services to pharmaprint to support its herbal based pharmaceuticals 
sales of products and services to pharmaprint in the year ended april  were of total revenues 
management expects the level of sales to pharmaprint to decline in fiscal due to growth in other areas and delays in sales of panax ginseng 
on november   the company signed a three year contract to supply roseox 
registered trademark  an antioxidant nutraceutical product  to d f industries d f  a manufacturer of vitamin and food supplement products 
under that agreement  d f had exclusive marketing rights to the company s antioxidant nutraceutical products  roseox

the company began shipping product under this contract during the third quarter of fiscal year  and delivered contractual quantities through the second quarter of fiscal on november   the company announced it had mutually agreed with d f  to cancel the exclusivity agreement between the companies 
a sales and marketing program by the company is now underway as this change in exclusivity allows the company to market roseox

flavor extracts 
competition for products in the flavor extract market is based on flavor quality and concentration  availability  customer service  and price 
some of these factors are beyond the direct control of the company 
natural food ingredients are products which perform a function in foods  such as preservatives  stabilizers  colorants  antioxidants  and nutritional additives 
the company s objective is to build a quality line of products generating revenues and profits as a leader in the development  manufacture and sale of natural food ingredients 
minimal revenue from natural food ingredients products was recognized in fiscal year  but shipments are expected to increase because of expanded marketing efforts generating interest from potential customers 
the company announced on november   its signing of a three year agreement with rfi ingredients rfi  whereby rfi will serve as exclusive distributors for the company s naturenhance

product lines to the foods and beverages industries 
to improve the success of these products  the company has reduced the number of products offered to allow for improved marketing focus and technical support of the remaining products 
however  management is unable to predict the timing and amount of future revenues from natural food ingredients products 
technical services the technical services business unit  comprised of hauser laboratories and shuster laboratories  inc  the company s wholly owned subsidiary  operates as a single entity in the research and development  formulation  analysis and project delivery to fee for service clients 
during the year ended april   technical services revenues increased almost over the last year  as the company concentrated its efforts on increasing the number of projects related to custom synthesis and natural products isolation in the pharmaceuticals industry 
additionally  research and development services from both hauser and shuster laboratories were sold to pharmaprint during the year as part of the expanded relationship mentioned earlier 
the company announced on november   a collaborative agreement with the national institute on drug abuse nida  for custom synthesis of drug compounds that are under development as potential treatment agents for various drug addictions 
under the agreement  the company will receive million over a three year period 
management believes that demand for technical services will continue to increase and expects this business unit to grow 
on going marketing efforts in the company s technical services business unit will be centered on projects that provide opportunity to employ the collective capabilities of the hauser laboratories and shuster laboratories team 
pharmaceuticals the company and its customer  yew tree  had been named in a lawsuit filed by bristol in the netherlands  alleging patent infringement in europe 
on july   the district court in the netherlands ruled against bristol in this proceeding  denying bristol s request for an injunction to stop yew tree from selling their product while the patent validity was determined 
subsequent to this result  bristol appealed the court s findings  and the case has now been settled in favor of yew tree 
bristol has also applied for and been granted patents related to paclitaxel based treatments in the united states 
such actions by bristol  if successful  could substantially reduce the market for the company s paclitaxel based products 
the company believes that these actions by bristol cannot be sustained  and intends to devote resources to defend its right to market its paclitaxel product in the united states and europe 
if the company is not successful in these efforts  the recovery of its investment in paclitaxel related assets including  of paclitaxel related inventory at april    as deposits on future raw materials  and approximately  net book value of related equipment used in the paclitaxel manufacturing process may be significantly delayed 
further  the company s customers wishing to enter the market for paclitaxel based therapies must obtain proper regulatory approval before they can formulate and sell paclitaxel in final form 
any delays in obtaining such approval will similarly delay the company s recovery of its investment in its paclitaxel based products 
on november   immunex corporation immunex  majority owned by american home products  inc ahp  announced that the us food and drug administration fda had accepted for review immunex s abbreviated new drug application for generic paclitaxel 
on january   bristol filed a patent infringement lawsuit against immunex 
now  the fda may withhold clearance of immunex s generic drug application until the earlier of june  or until a court enters a final judgment finding the patents invalid  unenforceable or not infringed 
on june   immunex announced that they will collaborate with ivx bioscience  inc  to market paclitaxel products in the united states  subject to fda approval 
ivx agreed to acquire the immunex abbreviated new drug application for generic paclitaxel 
ivx will also acquire immunex s inventories of bulk paclitaxel 
the company is currently in discussions with ahp  immunex and ivx bio science  inc with regard to its role in the supply of paclitaxel 
on may   the company entered into a multi year  worldwide and mutually exclusive supply agreement supply agreement with ahp  formerly american cyanamid company  whereby the company would supply bulk paclitaxel to ahp 
the company has been supplying bulk paclitaxel to ahp on a two part formula price basis which includes an initial minimum payment upon shipment of the bulk paclitaxel and a subsequent final payment  in the form of a royalty  when ahp sells finished products which contain the bulk paclitaxel 
the contract calls for certain minimum purchase requirements which are subject to variation based upon the company s production costs which resulted in aggregate minimum payments of approximately  during the first three years ending august 
the minimum aggregate payments are non refundable subject only to traditional product warranty criteria
