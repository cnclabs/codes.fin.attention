item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in connection with the company s audited financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
this annual report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements overview the company is a regional freight railroad operating in massachusetts  rhode island  connecticut and new york 
the company generates operating revenues primarily from the movement of freight in both conventional freight cars and in intermodal containers on flat cars over its rail lines 
freight revenues are recorded at the time delivery is made to the customer or the connecting carrier 
modest non freight operating revenues are derived from demurrage  switching  weighing  special train and other transportation services as well as from services rendered to freight customers and other outside parties by the company s maintenance of way  communications and signals and maintenance of equipment departments 
operating revenues also include amortization of deferred grant income 
the company s operating expenses consist of salaries and wages and related payroll taxes and employee benefits  depreciation  insurance and casualty claim expense  diesel fuel  car hire  property taxes  materials and supplies  purchased services and other expenses 
many of the company s operating expenses are of a relatively fixed nature and do not increase or decrease proportionately with increases or decreases in operating revenues unless the company s management takes specific actions to restructure the company s operations 
when comparing the company s results of operations from one year to another  the following factors should be taken into consideration 
first  the company has historically experienced fluctuations in operating revenues and expenses due to unpredictable events such as one time freight moves and customer plant expansions and shut downs 
second  the company s freight volumes are susceptible to increases and decreases due to changes in national and regional economic conditions 
the company also generates income through sales of properties  grants of easements and licenses and leases of land and tracks 
income or loss from sale  condemnation and disposal of property and equipment and grants of easements is recorded at the time the transaction is consummated and collectibility is assured 
this income varies significantly from year to year 
over the last ten years  such income has ranged from a low of  to a high of million with an annual average over this period of million 
the company has one customer  tilcon connecticut  inc  which accounted for approximately  and of its operating revenues in  and  respectively 
the company does not believe that this customer will cease to be a rail shipper or will significantly decrease its freight volume in the foreseeable future 
in the event that this customer should cease or significantly reduce its rail freight operations  management believes that the company could restructure its operations to reduce operating costs by an amount sufficient to offset the decrease in operating revenues

the increases in conventional and container freight revenues were primarily the result of increases in freight traffic volume 
the company s conventional freight carloadings increased by  or  to  carloadings in from  in total intermodal containers handled increased by  or  to  containers in from  in average revenue per conventional carloading decreased slightly  principally due to a shift in the relative volume of commodities handled toward construction aggregates  which command a comparatively lower freight rate 
the average rate received per intermodal container increased slightly due to rate increases attributable to increases in certain railroad industry cost indices 
the company experienced increases in shipments by many of the company s freight customers  attributable primarily to improved national and regional economic conditions as well as the company s marketing efforts 
the increase also reflected the addition of several new customers utilizing the company s rail services 
the  increase in non freight operating revenues resulted primarily from increases in maintenance of way department billings and from special train and other transportation revenues 
such revenues can vary significantly from year to year depending upon customer needs 
operating expenses operating expenses increased  or  to million in from million in operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenues operating ratio  however  decreased to in from in the small increase in operating expenses and the decrease in the operating ratio were attributable to the relatively fixed nature of the company s operating expenses and the fact that capitalized costs for track and bridge projects as well as costs recovered from government grants for public improvements  such as surfacing and signals for grade crossings  increased million  or  to million in from million in casualties and insurance expense decreased  or  to  in from  in  principally due to the absence of any expenditures in for casualty losses in excess of amounts previously reserved 
casualty loss expense was  in purchased services and track and signal materials expense increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was primarily attributable to the increased capital projects and cost recovery programs carried out in other income other income decreased million  or  to  in from million in  due primarily to a decrease in net gains from the sale  condemnation and disposal of properties and easements 
the amount reflected a million condemnation award 
interest expense interest expense was virtually unchanged between and interest on approximately  of debt incurred to finance the acquisition of three locomotives during the second quarter of was essentially offset by interest reductions resulting from principal payments on existing indebtedness 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenues operating revenues decreased  or  to million in from million in this decrease was comprised primarily of a  decrease in conventional carload revenues 
other non freight operating revenues were virtually unchanged between the two years 
the decreases in conventional and container freight revenues were primarily due to decreases in traffic volumes partially offset by higher average revenues received per conventional carloading and per container 
the company s conventional freight carloadings decreased  or  to  carloadings in from  in total intermodal containers handled decreased  or  to  in from  in increases in the average revenue received per conventional carloading were primarily due to a change in the mix of commodities toward higher revenue items while the increase in the average revenue received per container resulted from rate increases tied to increases in certain railroad industry cost indices 
the decreases in both carload and container traffic volume in from were attributable to an economic slowdown which first became apparent late in the third quarter of adverse weather conditions in the first quarter of also contributed to the decline in traffic 
during the third quarter of  as a result of improving economic conditions  conventional traffic volume began to return to levels 
conventional traffic volume for the fourth quarter of exceeded the prior year s level by and  as previously noted  these higher traffic levels carried forward into operating expenses operating expenses remained relatively stable at approximately million in and the operating ratio increased in to from in casualties and insurance expense decreased  or  to  in from million in this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the cost of casualty and environmental claims  which decreased  to  in from  in the high level of claims in was attributable to a large environmental claim that was settled during that year 
purchased services and track and signal materials expense decreased million  or  to million in from million in this decrease was attributable to a lower level of capital projects and cost recovery programs carried out during other income other income increased million  or  to million in from  in due to substantially higher net gains realized from the sale  condemnation and disposal of properties and easements 
in  the company received million from the state of rhode island s condemnation of an abandoned rail line 
interest expense interest expense increased  or  to million in from million in this increase was principally the result of interest on the subordinated note payable to mcrc  in the principal amount of million  which originated in december liquidity and capital resources the company has relied primarily on cash generated from operations to fund working capital and capital expenditures relating to ongoing operations  while relying on borrowed funds to finance acquisitions and equipment needs  primarily rolling stock 
the company generated million  million and million of cash from operations in  and  respectively 
the company s total cash and cash equivalents increased by million in  but decreased by million and  in and  respectively

during  and  the company generated approximately  million and  respectively  from the sales and disposals of properties not considered essential for railroad operations and from easements  including the million condemnation award received in the company holds various properties which could be made available for sale  lease  license or grants of easements 
revenues from sales of properties and easements can vary significantly from year to year 
substantially all of the mainline track owned by the company meets fra class standards permitting freight train speeds of miles per hour  and the company intends to continue to maintain this track at this level 
the company expended million  million and million for track structure and bridge improvements in  and  respectively 
deferred grant income in the amount of  in   in and  in financed a portion of these improvements 
in addition  the company received  of grant proceeds in to purchase track materials for a three year track improvement project commenced in  which the company expects to complete by the track materials were purchased during and are included in materials and supplies on the accompanying balance sheet as of december  management estimates that approximately million of improvements to the company s track structure and bridges will be made in  provided that sufficient funds  including grant proceeds  are available 
improvements to the company s track structure are made  for the most part  by the company s maintenance of way department personnel 
the company acquired and renovated three used locomotives during the second quarter of at a total cost of  financed through long term borrowings from a commercial lender 
expenditures incurred on this project are included as expenditures for equipment additions in the accompanying statements of cash flows

loans in the amount of million were outstanding under this line of credit as of december  the average interest rate for was 
the company obtained million from mcrc in december in exchange for a subordinated note and warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
a portion of the proceeds was utilized to repay the outstanding principal balance on a million term note

mcrc must apply million of the amount due on the mcrc note toward the exercise of the mcrc warrants upon the company s consummation of a public offering of its common stock at a purchase price of not less than per share which results in gross proceeds to the company of not less than million 
at december   the company had long term senior debt and subordinated debt outstanding totaling million  of which  is due within one year 
comparable figures at december  were million and  respectively 
the company concluded an agreement in october to acquire all of the outstanding stock of connecticut central railroad company conn central in exchange for shares of common stock 
the company expects to complete this acquisition during the second quarter of management is not able to predict the total impact of this acquisition upon future operations but estimates that rail freight revenues from existing customers of conn central will total approximately  per year at the current level of operations 
in addition  management intends to pursue additional growth opportunities that may be available on these lines 
in  the company paid dividends in the amount of per share on its outstanding preferred stock and per share on its outstanding common stock

inflation in recent years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations 
seasonality historically  the company s operating revenues are lowest for the first quarter due to the absence of aggregate shipments during this period and to winter weather conditions 
year compliance the company operates a mainframe computer with a pc network and employs three in house programmers who write and maintain a substantial portion of the company s software programs 
the company utilizes electronic data interchange and interline settlement systems through railinc in washington  dc for the interchange of rail cars and revenue allocations with other railroads 
the company has compatible back up mainframe systems at both its worcester  massachusetts and plainfield  connecticut facilities 
preparations for the year have been underway for six years and changes to the company s programs are substantially complete 
due to the short periodic cycle of rail car movements  the exchange of data covers time periods where year compliance is not a major factor and should not adversely affect the company s business 
the company does rely on waybills and car supply and revenue data generated by other railroads in the interchange of rail cars 
the failure of these railroads to supply accurate data could disrupt the company s operations 
railinc has informed the company that it is currently addressing the year issue and the company believes that its programs can be readily modified to accommodate any resulting changes which may be required 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income and sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components revenues  expenses  gains and losses in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
sfas establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports 
it also establishes standards of related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
both standards will be adopted by the company during the first quarter of and are not expected to have material effects on its financial position and results of operations
