the following discussion summarizes underwriting results by major operation as defined below and net miscellaneous expenses

written premiums    underwriting results 
combined ratio 


excludes the impact of a  before tax  environmental and asbestos charge 
including the impact of this charge  the combined ratio for was for the north american property casualty segment 

combined ratio is a common industry measurement of the results of property and casualty insurance underwriting 
this ratio is the sum of the ratio of incurred claims and claim expenses to premiums earned the loss ratio and the ratio of underwriting expenses incurred to premiums written the expense ratio 
a combined ratio under generally indicates an underwriting profit 
federal income taxes  net investment income  deferred policy acquisition costs and other non underwriting expenses are not reflected in the combined ratio 
written premiums for this segment increased in from  while premiums for were up slightly from premiums from the segment s primary target markets of reinsurance  small commercial accounts and aarp grew in and in  contributing and growth to the total segment in and  respectively 
however  of this segment growth was offset in each year by an and premium reduction in mid to large commercial accounts and agency personal lines in and  respectively 
underwriting results for improved  or combined ratio points  from primarily from a decrease in property catastrophe and other severe weather related losses of and a reduction of in incurred environmental and asbestos losses as a result of the charge taken in the third quarter of upon completion of the company s environmental and asbestos database study for further discussion see  the environmental and asbestos claims section 
partially offsetting these two favorable items were expenses related to significant investments in future growth initiatives and dividends to policyholders in two states in recognition of favorable personal lines automobile results 
in  underwriting losses before tax increased  or combined ratio points  over primarily due to a increase in property catastrophe and other severe weather related losses  most notably several first quarter winter storms and hurricane fran in september 
partially offsetting this increase were the impact of two significant losses  net of reinsurance  in in connection with the settlement of claims against dow corning corporation alleging product defects arising from breast implants  and resulting from the company s share of a single industrial fire covered by the industrial risk insurance iri pool 
the north american property casualty segment consists of three major operations commercial  personal and reinsurance 
a description of each operation  including an analysis of underwriting results  follows 
commercial written premiums    underwriting results combined ratio commercial provides workers compensation  property  automobile  liability  marine  agricultural and bond coverages to commercial accounts throughout the united states and canada 
excess and surplus lines business not normally written by standard lines insurers is also provided 
commercial is organized into three customer market segments business insurance  commercial affinity and commercial specialty 
business insurance provides standard commercial business for small accounts select customer and mid sized insureds 
commercial affinity provides commercial risk management products and services to members of affinity groups and customers of financial institutions 
commercial specialty provides insurance through retailers and wholesalers to large commercial clients and insureds requiring a variety of specialized coverages 
its results include the bond lines and first state management group  a leading underwriter of excess and surplus lines business produced primarily through wholesale brokers 
agricultural  livestock and marine products are also managed within commercial specialty 
written premiums decreased in  compared to a decrease in premium growth in several markets and lines of business including select customer  commercial affinity  bond  marine and agriculture  specialty property and specialty casualty totaled in  contributing to commercial s total premium growth rate 
however  this total premium growth was more than offset by a decline in large national accounts caused by declining workers compensation rates and intense price competition 
in  the primary causes for the decrease from the prior year were intense price competition primarily in larger national accounts and a decline in workers compensation premium from workers compensation pools and a shift to large deductibles 
underwriting results improved  or combined ratio points  in as compared with the primary factors contributing to the improvement were reductions in property catastrophe and other severe weather related losses of and a reduction of asbestos and environmental incurred losses of as a result of the charge taken in also  continued favorable loss and loss expense development trends  particularly in workers compensation and other casualty lines  have been generated through the execution of the operation s total cost containment strategy which includes loss prevention and avoidance  early reporting  active claim management and prompt return to work programs 
partially offsetting the favorable losses described above was a reduction in earned premiums  primarily from the declining written premium from large national accounts over the last two years  which have a high percentage of january renewals and therefore a more significant impact on earned premiums 
in  underwriting results improved  or combined ratio points  compared with the prior year 
this improvement reflected the impact in of a loss  net of reinsurance  in connection with a settlement of claims against dow corning corporation alleging product defects arising from breast implants and a net loss resulting from a single industrial fire covered by the iri pool 
excluding the impact of these items on the prior year comparison  underwriting results decreased from  reflecting a point increase in the combined ratio from the adjusted level 
this decline was primarily due to a decrease in property results of approximately which were adversely impacted by property catastrophe and other severe weather related losses 
despite intense competition  favorable workers compensation results partially offset this decrease reflecting the impacts of legislative reforms  depopulation in residual pools and effective managed care related initiatives 
personal written premiums    underwriting results combined ratio personal provides automobile  homeowners  home based business and fire coverages to individuals throughout the united states 
personal is organized to provide customized products and services to three market opportunities the membership of aarp through a direct marketing operation  customers who prefer local agent involvement through a network of independent agents  and members of other affinity groups through an affinity center which began in and is building from the aarp operation competencies 
aarp s exclusive licensing arrangement continues through the year  thus providing the company with an important competitive advantage 
written premiums increased in compared to a increase in both years included strong growth in aarp premium of which is benefiting from the favorable expansion of this demographic group  partially offset by declines in agency premiums of in and in the decline in was due to the sale of the company s canadian personal lines as well as disruption in the incoming flow of business associated with a major strategic shift in emphasis from homeowners to automobile coverages 
the decline was due to selective disinvestment in unprofitable states and underperforming agents 
aarp premiums represented of the personal premiums  up from in and in underwriting results improved by in over  with a corresponding point improvement in the combined ratio 
this improvement was primarily due to significantly lower property catastrophe and other severe weather related losses of improved automobile and homeowners profitability resulting from expanded cost containment initiatives was partially offset by expenses related to significant investments in future growth initiatives and a dividend to policyholders in two states in recognition of favorable personal lines automobile results 
underwriting results decreased by in  with a point increase in the combined ratio 
these results were due to an increase in property catastrophe and other severe weather related losses of  partially offset by improved automobile results 
reinsurance written premiums underwriting results combined ratio the hartford assumes reinsurance worldwide through its nine hartford reinsurance company hartre offices located in hartford  san francisco  miami  philadelphia  toronto  london  madrid  munich and hong kong 
hartre primarily writes treaty reinsurance through professional reinsurance brokers covering various property  casualty  specialty and marine classes of business 
written premiums increased in primarily due to the acquisition of renewal rights for the business of security re and san francisco re which occurred in late written premiums grew in primarily due to growth in us casualty and specialty lines 
this growth resulted from a combination of new business opportunities  an increased level of renewals  and continued new product development in specialty lines  partially offset by a reduction in domestic and international property and marine rates 
underwriting results for decreased  or combined ratio points  from as favorable worldwide property catastrophe experience was offset by increasingly competitive market conditions which softened premium rate levels 
during  hartre began a strategic shift in its business mix to longer tailed casualty and specialty lines to provide further growth opportunities and better diversify its portfolio 
the expected profitability composition of such longer tailed lines includes a higher investment income component  which allows for higher targeted combined ratios 
as a result of this strategy  along with higher property catastrophe losses  underwriting results decreased compared with miscellaneous expenses  net miscellaneous expenses  net of miscellaneous income items  were in  up from in this increase was primarily due to increased debt service costs of resulting from additional borrowings and a reallocation of corporate debt costs to the north american property casualty segment 
miscellaneous expenses for were  up from in this increase was primarily due to increased debt costs of from additional borrowings partially offset by increased service fee income from involuntary pool servicing contracts net of other miscellaneous expenses 
outlook difficult market conditions and intense price competition within the property and casualty industry show no signs of diminishing in the near term 
however  several major strategic actions are underway  with many completed in  which management believes may counterbalance these negative external factors and position the north american property casualty segment for improved written premium growth in and beyond  while maintaining core profitability 
the acquisition of omni insurance group  inc  which was completed on february   provides personal immediate access to the non standard automobile market with a highly regarded and well established franchise 
for additional information  see capital resources and liquidity section under omni 
strategic alliances have been formed with several major national and regional banks to market personal and or commercial products to each banks customers 
the hartford customer services group contracted with aarp to service its group health insurance plan partners and recipients beginning january  significant investments have been made in such areas as advertising  product research and development  technology and staff training to heighten brand awareness  increase product offerings  further develop alternative distribution channels and improve productivity 
on going claim initiatives have kept claim cost increases below national trends 
as a result of these and other actions and initiatives  management believes the north american property casualty segment stands poised to capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead

according to the latest results published by the life insurance marketing and research association limra december  the company was the second largest provider of group disability insurance for the nine months ended september  revenues decreased  or  to billion in from billion in this decrease was primarily attributable to the coli business for which associated revenues decreased  or  to from billion in the decrease in coli revenues is primarily a result of the elimination of sales of leveraged coli due to the hipa act of which phases out the deductibility of interest on policy loans under leveraged coli by the end of partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in group insurance revenues of  or  to billion from billion in the increase in revenues is mainly attributable to group life and group disability premium growth  as a result of strong new business sales and renewals

the results were impacted by a operating loss related to the division s international operations 
this loss was primarily attributable to the segment s operations in argentina  specifically  the company s investment in itt hartford sudamericana holdings  sa suda 
in november  the company replaced the argentine management team with a new management team and purchased the remaining interest in suda from the local shareholders

historically  a significant majority of these contracts were sold as general account contracts with fixed rates and fixed maturities 
the company decided in  after a thorough review of its grc business  that it would significantly de emphasize general account grc  choosing instead to focus its distribution efforts on other products sold through other divisions and selling general account grc primarily as an accommodation to customers 
from to  the gic division sold over billion of grc 
in contrast  the gic division sold only and general account grc in and  respectively 
consistent with management s expectations  the division had no core earnings in and expects no material income or loss from the gic division in the future 
closed book grc results in and were negatively affected by lower investment rates and earnings in the related investment portfolio primarily consisting of collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed securities due to prepayments experienced in excess of assumed and historical levels in years prior to closed book grc was also negatively affected by the interest rate rise in when the duration of its assets lengthened relative to that of the liabilities 
although the closed book grc asset portfolio as a whole is duration matched with its liabilities  certain investments continue to have a longer maturity than their corresponding liabilities and will need to be liquidated prior to maturity in order to meet the specific liability commitments 
to protect the existing value of these investments  the company entered into various hedge transactions in late september which substantially eliminated further fluctuation in fair value of the investments due to interest rate changes 
as of december   closed book grc had general account assets and liabilities of billion 
the scheduled maturities are billion  or  in  billion  or  in and billion  or  thereafter 
during  closed book grc incurred a  after tax  loss from operations as a result of negative interest spread  as compared with an after tax loss from operations of in with the initiation of the hedge transactions discussed above  which eliminated the possibility that the fair value of closed book grc investments would recover to their current amortized cost prior to sale  an other than temporary impairment loss of  after tax  was determined to have occurred and was recorded in september an additional other than temporary impairment loss of  after tax  occurred in the fourth quarter of bringing the total impairment to also  during the third quarter of  closed book grc had asset sales resulting in proceeds of approximately and a realized loss of  after tax 
the asset sales were undertaken as a result of liquidity needs and favorable market conditions for certain securities 
other charges of  after tax  were also incurred in the third quarter of outlook management believes that it has developed and implemented strategies to maintain and enhance its position as a market leader within the financial services industry  to continue the life segment s asset growth and to maximize shareholder value 
the life segment s strong market position in each of its primary businesses  coupled with the growth potential management believes exists in its markets  provides opportunities to increase sales of the life segment s products and services as individuals increasingly save and plan for retirement  financially protect themselves and their families against disability or death and prepare their estates for an efficient transfer of wealth between generations 
management expects that the net income loss from closed book grc in the years subsequent to will be immaterial based on the actual results from  current projections for the performance of the assets and liabilities associated with closed book grc  and the stabilizing effect of the hedge transactions implemented in however  no assurance can be given that  under certain unanticipated economic circumstances  further losses in respect of closed book grc will not occur in the future 
the hipa act of phases out the deductibility of interest on policy loans under coli by the end of  thus eliminating all future sales of leveraged coli 
the leveraged coli product has been an important contributor to the life segment s profitability in recent years and will continue to contribute to the profitability of the life segment in the future  although the level of profit is declining 
however  the employee benefits division has other growth opportunities particularly through its group insurance products

reserves the hartford establishes property and casualty reserves to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims made by policyholders or against policyholders 
these reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported and those that have been incurred but not reported  and include estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling these claims 
estimating the ultimate cost of future claims and claim adjustment expenses is an uncertain and complex process 
this estimation process is based largely on the assumption that past developments are an appropriate predictor of future events  and involves a variety of actuarial techniques that analyze experience  trends and other relevant factors 
the uncertainties involved with the reserving process have become increasingly unpredictable due to a number of complex factors including social and economic trends and changes in the concepts of legal liability and damage awards 
accordingly  final claim settlements may vary from the present estimates  particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future 
the hartford continually reviews its estimated claims and claim adjustment expense reserves as additional experience and other relevant data become available  and reserve levels are adjusted accordingly 
adjustments to previously established reserves  if any  will be reflected in the operating results of the period in which the adjustment is made 
in the judgment of management  all information currently available has been properly considered in the reserves established for claims and claim adjustment expenses 
for a discussion of environmental and asbestos claims and the uncertainties related to these reserves  refer to the next section 
in accordance with the insurance laws and regulations under which the life segment operates  life insurance subsidiaries of the hartford establish actuarially determined reserves to meet their obligations on their outstanding life and disability insurance contracts  as well as reserves for their universal life and investment contracts 
reserves for life insurance and disability contracts are based on mortality and morbidity tables in general use in the united states  modified to reflect the hartford s experience 
management believes that these reserves  with additions from premiums to be received  and with interest on such reserves compounded annually at certain assumed rates  will be sufficient to meet the hartford s policy obligations at their maturities or in the event of an insured s death 
reserves for universal life insurance and investment products represent policy account balances before applicable surrender charges 
environmental and asbestos claims the hartford continues to receive claims asserting damages from environmental exposures and for injuries from asbestos and asbestos related products  both of which affect the north american property casualty  international and other operations segments 
environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and related clean up costs 
with regard to these claims  uncertainty exists which impacts the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves for unpaid losses and related settlement expenses 
the hartford finds that conventional reserving techniques cannot estimate the ultimate cost of these claims because of inadequate development patterns and inconsistent emerging legal doctrine 
for the majority of environmental claims and many types of asbestos claims  unlike any other type of contractual claim  there is almost no agreement or consistent precedent to determine what  if any  coverage exists or which  if any  policy years and insurers or reinsurers may be liable 
further uncertainty arises with environmental claims since claims are often made under policies  the existence of which may be in dispute  the terms of which may have changed over many years  which may or may not provide for legal defense costs  and which may or may not contain environmental exclusion clauses that may be absolute or allow for fortuitous events 
courts in different jurisdictions have reached disparate conclusions on similar issues and in certain situations have broadened the interpretation of policy coverage and liability issues 
in light of the extensive claim settlement process for environmental and asbestos claims  involving comprehensive fact gathering  subject matter expertise and intensive litigation  the hartford established an environmental claims facility in to defend itself aggressively against unwarranted claims and to minimize costs 
within the property and casualty insurance industry  progress has been made in developing sophisticated  alternative methodologies utilizing company experience and supplemental databases to assess environmental and asbestos liabilities 
consistent with the hartford s practice of using the best techniques to estimate the company s environmental and asbestos exposures  a study was initiated in april the hartford  utilizing internal staff supplemented by outside legal and actuarial consultants  completed the study in october the study included a review of identified environmental and asbestos exposures of north american property casualty  us exposures of the hartford s international segment and exposures of the other operations segment  and covered the company s commercial  personal  and reinsurance operations 
the methodology utilized a ground up analysis of policy  site and exposure level data for a representative sample of the hartford s claims 
the results of the evaluation were extrapolated against the balance of the claim population to estimate the company s overall exposure for reported claims 
in addition to estimating liabilities on reported environmental and asbestos claims  the hartford estimated reserves for claims incurred but not reported ibnr 
the ibnr reserve was estimated using information on reporting patterns of known insureds  characteristics of insureds such as limits exposed  attachment points and number of coverage years involved  third party costs  and closed claims 
included in the hartford s analysis of environmental and asbestos exposures was a review of applicable reinsurance coverage 
reinsurance coverage applicable to the sample was used to estimate the reinsurance coverage that applied to the balance of the reported environmental and asbestos claims and to the ibnr estimates 
an international actuarial firm reviewed the hartford s approach and concluded that the way the company studied its exposures  the thoroughness of its analysis and the way the hartford came to its estimates were reasonable and comprehensive 
upon completion of the study and assessment of the results in october  the hartford determined that its environmental and asbestos reserves should be increased  on an undiscounted basis  by net of reinsurance and net of reinsurance  respectively 
reserve activity for both reported and unreported environmental and asbestos claims  including reserves for legal defense costs  for the years ended december   and  was as follows net of reinsurance environmental and asbestos claims claims and claim adjustment expenses environmental asbestos total environmental asbestos total total

the ending liabilities are net of reinsurance on reported and unreported claims of   and  for  and  respectively 
gross of reinsurance  as of december   and reserves for environmental and asbestos were  and   and  and  and  respectively 
the hartford s pretax operating earnings have been impacted over the last three years by incurred environmental and asbestos claims and claim adjustment expenses  net of reinsurance  as follows in  in and in the hartford believes that the environmental and asbestos reserves reported at december  are a reasonable estimate of the ultimate remaining liability for these claims based upon known facts  current assumptions and the hartford s methodologies 
future social  economic  legal or legislative developments may alter the original intent of policies and the scope of coverage 
the hartford will continue to evaluate new developments and methodologies as they become available for use in supplementing the company s ongoing analysis and review of its environmental and asbestos exposures 
these future reviews may result in a change in reserves  impacting the hartford s results of operations in the period in which the reserve estimates are changed 
while the effects of future changes in facts  legal and other issues could have a material effect on future results of operations  the hartford does not expect such changes would have a material effect on its liquidity or financial condition 
investments an important element of the financial results of the hartford is return on invested assets 
the hartford s investment activities are divided between the reportable segments of north american property casualty  life  international  and other operations 
the investment portfolios for these segments are managed based on the underlying characteristics and nature of their respective liabilities 
for a further discussion on the hartford s approach to managing risks  see the capital markets risk management section 
the investment portfolios of the individual segments are managed by distinct investment strategy groups which are accountable to the senior management of the segments 
they are responsible for monitoring and managing the segment s asset liability profile  establishing investment objectives and guidelines  and determining  within specified risk tolerances and investment guidelines  the appropriate asset allocation  duration  and convexity characteristics of the portfolios 
hartford investment management company  a wholly owned subsidiary of the hartford  executes the investment plan of the strategy groups including the identification and purchase of securities that fulfill the objectives of the strategy groups 
international subsidiaries maintain individual investment units with comparable responsibilities 
north american property casualty the investment objective of the north american property casualty segment is to maximize economic value while generating after tax income and sufficient liquidity to meet corporate and policyholder obligations 
investment strategies are developed based on a variety of factors  including business needs  regulatory requirements and tax considerations

separate accounts reflect two categories of risk assumption non guaranteed separate accounts totaling billion as of december   wherein the policyholder assumes substantially all the risk and reward  and guaranteed separate accounts totaling billion as of december  wherein the hartford contractually guarantees either a minimum return or account value to the policyholder 
investment strategy varies by fund choice  as outlined in the applicable fund prospectus or separate account plan of operations 
non guaranteed separate account products include variable annuities  variable life insurance contracts and coli 
guaranteed separate account products primarily consist of modified guaranteed individual annuity and modified guaranteed life insurance  and generally include market value adjustment features to mitigate the disintermediation risk in the event of surrenders 
capital markets risk management the hartford has a disciplined approach to managing risks associated with its capital markets and asset liability management activities 
investment portfolio management is organized to focus investment management expertise on specific classes of investments while asset liability management is the responsibility of separate and distinct risk management units supporting the property and casualty and life operations 
derivative instruments are utilized in accordance with established company policy and are monitored internally and reviewed by senior management 
the company is exposed to two primary sources of investment and asset liability management risk credit risk  relating to the uncertainty associated with the ability of an obligor or counterparty to make timely payments of principal and or interest  and market risk  relating to the market price and or cash flow variability associated with changes in interest rates  securities prices  market indices  yield curves or currency exchange rates 
the company does not hold any financial instruments entered into for trading purposes 
credit risk the hartford has established investment credit policies that focus on the credit quality of obligors and counterparties  limit credit concentrations  encourage diversification and require frequent creditworthiness reviews 
investment activity  including setting of policy and defining acceptable risk levels  is subject to regular review and approval by senior management and frequent review by the company s finance committee 
the company invests primarily in investment grade securities and has established exposure limits  diversification standards and review procedures for all credit risks whether borrower  issuer or counterparty 
creditworthiness of specific obligors is determined by an internal credit evaluation supplemented by consideration of external determinants of creditworthiness  typically ratings assigned by nationally recognized ratings agencies 
obligor  geographic  asset sector and industry concentrations are subject to established limits and monitored on a regular interval 
the company s derivatives counterparty exposure policy establishes market based credit limits  favors long term financial stability and creditworthiness  and typically requires credit enhancement credit risk reducing agreements 
credit risk is measured as the amount owed to the company based on current market conditions and potential payment obligations between the company and its counterparties 
credit exposures are quantified weekly and netted  and collateral is pledged to or held by the company to the extent the current value of derivatives exceed exposure policy thresholds 
the hartford is not exposed to any significant credit concentration risk of a single issuer 
the following tables identify fixed maturity securities for the property and casualty operations  including international and other operations  and the life operations  including international operations and guaranteed separate accounts  by credit quality 
the ratings referenced in the tables are based on the ratings of a nationally recognized rating organization or  if not rated  assigned based on the company s internal analysis of such securities

the property and casualty operations attempt to maximize economic value while generating appropriate after tax income and sufficient liquidity to meet corporate and policyholder obligations 
the property and casualty operations have material exposure to interest rate and equity market risk 
the life operations are responsible for maximizing after tax returns within acceptable risk parameters including the management of the interest rate sensitivity of invested assets to that of policyholder obligations 
the life operations have material market exposure to interest rate risk associated with its fixed maturity portfolios 
the company continually monitors these exposures and adjusts the composition and profile of its invested assets through both the cash and derivatives markets to manage these risks 
the company analyzes interest rate risk using various models including multi scenario cash flow projection models that forecast cash flows of the liabilities and their supporting investments  including derivative instruments 
derivative instruments the hartford utilizes a variety of derivative instruments  including swaps  caps  floors  forwards and exchange traded futures and options  in accordance with company policy and in order to achieve one of three company approved objectives to hedge risk arising from interest rate  price or currency exchange rate volatility  to manage liquidity  or to control transaction costs 
the company does not make a market or trade derivatives for the express purpose of earning trading profits 
the company uses derivative instruments in its management of market risk consistent with four risk management strategies hedging anticipated transactions  hedging liability instruments  hedging invested assets and hedging portfolios of assets and or liabilities 
for additional information of these strategies along with tables reflecting outstanding derivative instruments  see the property and casualty operations and life operations discussions below 
derivative activities are monitored by an internal compliance unit  reviewed frequently by senior management and reported to the company s finance committee 
the notional amounts of derivative contracts represent the basis upon which pay or receive amounts are calculated and are not reflective of credit risk 
notional amounts pertaining to derivative instruments for both general and guaranteed separate accounts totaled billion at december  the following discussions focus on the key market risk exposures within each of the property and casualty and life operations 
property and casualty operations interest rate risk the primary exposure to interest rate risk in the property and casualty operations relates to its fixed maturity investments 
changes in market interest rates directly impact the market value of the fixed maturity securities 
in addition  but to a lesser extent  interest rate risk exists on debt issued 
derivative instruments are used periodically to manage interest rate risk and as a result  their value will change as market rates change  usually in the opposite direction of the item being hedged 
the total notional amount of derivatives used for hedging interest rate risk was as of december  the principal amounts of the fixed and variable rate fixed maturity portfolios  along with the respective weighted average coupons at december   are reflected in the following table by estimated maturity year 
expected maturities differ from contractual maturities due to call or prepayment provisions 
the weighted average coupon on variable rate securities is based upon spot rates as of december   and is based primarily on london interbank offered rate libor 
callable bonds and notes are primarily municipal bonds  and are distributed to either call dates or maturity depending on which date produces the most conservative yield 
asset backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed securities are distributed to maturity year based on estimates of the rate of future prepayments of principal over the remaining life of the securities 
these estimates are developed using prepayment speeds contained in broker consensus data 
such estimates are derived from prepayment speeds previously experienced at interest rate levels projected for the underlying collateral 
actual prepayment experience may vary from these estimates 
financial instruments with certain leverage features have been included in each of the fixed maturity categories 
these instruments have not been separately displayed as they were immaterial to the property and casualty operations investment portfolio

the risk associated with these securities relates to potential decreases in value resulting from changes in the equity prices 
the operations may occasionally use equity futures to hedge against a change in value on the anticipated purchase or sale of equity securities 
as of december   there were no outstanding derivative instruments hedging equity price risk

currency exchange risk currency exchange risk within the property and casualty operations relates primarily to translating both profits and net equity investment in its international subsidiaries from the subsidiary s local currency to us dollars

forward foreign contracts with a notional amount of are used to hedge this risk 
life operations interest rate risk the life operations general and guaranteed separate account exposure to interest rate risk relates to the market price and or cash flow variability associated with changes in market interest rates 
changes in interest rates can potentially impact the life operations profitability 
under certain circumstances of interest rate volatility  the life operations could be exposed to disintermediation risk and reduction in net interest rate spread or profit margins 
for the life operations non guaranteed separate accounts  exposure is not significant as the policyholder assumes substantially all of the investment risk 
the life operations general account and guaranteed separate account investment portfolios primarily consist of investment grade  fixed maturity securities  including corporate bonds  asset backed securities  commercial mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations 
the fair value of these and the life operations other invested assets fluctuates depending on the interest rate environment and other general economic conditions 
during periods of declining interest rates  paydowns on residential mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations increase as the underlying mortgages are prepaid 
during such periods  the company generally will not be able to reinvest the proceeds of any such prepayments at comparable yields 
conversely  during periods of rising interest rates  the rate of prepayments generally slows  also exposing the company to the possibility of asset liability cash flow and yield mismatch 
for further discussion of the company s risk management techniques to manage this market risk  see the asset and liability management strategies used to manage market risk discussed below 
as described above  the life operations hold a significant fixed maturity portfolio which includes both fixed and variable rate features 
the following table reflects the principal amounts of the life operations general and guaranteed separate account fixed and variable rate fixed maturity portfolios  at december   along with the respective weighted average coupons  by estimated maturity year 
expected maturities differ from contractual maturities due to call or prepayment provisions 
the weighted average coupon on variable rate securities is based upon spot rates as of december   and is primarily based upon libor 
callable bonds and notes are distributed to either call dates or maturity depending on which date produces the most conservative yield 
asset backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed securities are distributed to maturity year based on estimates of the rate of future prepayments of principal over the remaining life of the securities 
these estimates are developed using prepayment speeds provided in broker consensus data 
such estimates are derived from prepayment speeds previously experienced at the interest rate levels projected for the underlying collateral 
actual prepayment experience may vary from these estimates 
financial instruments with certain leverage features have been included in each of the fixed maturity categories 
these instruments have not been separately displayed because they were immaterial to the life investment portfolio

for certain portfolios  management monitors the changes in present value between assets and liabilities resulting from various interest rate scenarios using integrated asset liability measurement systems and a proprietary system that simulates the impacts of parallel and non parallel yield curve shifts 
based on this current and prospective information  management implements risk reducing techniques to improve the match between assets and liabilities 
derivatives play an important role in facilitating the management of interest rate risk  creating opportunities to efficiently fund obligations  hedge against risks that affect the value of certain liabilities and adjust broad investment risk characteristics as a result of any significant changes in market risks 
as an end user of derivatives  the life operations use a variety of derivatives  including swaps  caps  floors  forwards and exchange traded financial futures and options  in order to hedge exposure primarily to interest rate risk on anticipated investment purchases or existing assets and liabilities 
notional amounts pertaining to derivatives totaled billion at december  billion related to insurance investments and billion related to life insurance liabilities 
the strategies described below are used to manage the aforementioned risks 
anticipatory hedging for certain liabilities  life operations commits to the price of the product prior to receipt of the associated premium or deposit 
anticipatory hedges are routinely executed to offset the impact of changes in asset prices arising from interest rate changes pending the receipt of premium or deposit and the subsequent purchase of an asset 
these hedges involve taking a long position in interest rate futures or entering into an interest rate swap with duration characteristics equivalent to the associated liabilities or anticipated investments 
the notional amount of anticipatory hedges as of december  was liability hedging several products obligate the life operations to credit a return to the contractholder which is indexed to a market rate 
to hedge risks associated with these products  the life operation typically enters into interest rate swaps to convert the contract rate into a rate that trades in a more liquid and efficient market 
this hedging strategy enables the life operations to customize contract terms and conditions to customer objectives and satisfies the operation s asset liability matching policy 
additionally  interest rate swaps are used to convert certain fixed contract rates into floating rates  thereby allowing them to be appropriately matched against floating rate assets 
the notional amount of derivatives used for liability hedging as of december  was billion 
asset hedging to meet the various life policyholder obligations and to provide cost effective prudent investment risk diversification  the life operations may combine two or more financial instruments to achieve the investment characteristics of a fixed maturity security or that match an associated liability 
the use of derivative instruments in this regard effectively transfers unwanted investment risks or attributes to others 
the selection of the appropriate derivative instruments depends on the investment risk  the liquidity and efficiency of the market  and the asset and liability characteristics 
the notional amount of asset hedges as of december  was billion 
portfolio hedging the life operation periodically compares the duration and convexity of its portfolios of assets to their corresponding liabilities and enters into portfolio hedges to reduce any difference to desired levels 
portfolio hedges reduce the mismatch between assets and liabilities and offset the potential impact to cash flows caused by changes in interest rates 
the notional amount of portfolio hedges as of december  was billion 
the following tables provide information as of december  on derivative instruments used in accordance with the aforementioned hedging strategies

life insurance liability characteristics life operations insurance liabilities  other than non guaranteed separate accounts  are primarily related to accumulation vehicles such as fixed or variable annuities and investment contracts and other insurance products such as long term disability and term life insurance 
asset accumulation vehicles while interest rate risk associated with these insurance products has been reduced through the use of market value adjustment features and surrender charges  the primary risk associated with these products is that the spread between investment return and credited rate may not be sufficient to earn targeted returns 
fixed rate products in this category require the life operations to pay a fixed rate for a certain period of time 
the cash flows are not interest sensitive because the products are written with a market value adjustment feature and the liabilities have protection against the early withdrawal of funds through surrender charges 
product examples include fixed rate annuities with a market value adjustment and fixed rate guaranteed investment contracts 
contract duration is dependent on the policyholder s choice of guarantee period 
indexed products in this category are similar to the fixed rate asset accumulation vehicles but require the life operations to pay a rate that is determined by an external index 
the amount and or timing of cash flows will therefore vary based on the level of the particular index 
the primary risks inherent in these products are similar to the fixed rate asset accumulation vehicles  with an additional risk that changes in the index may adversely affect profitability 
product examples include indexed guaranteed investment contracts with an estimated duration of up to two years 
interest credited products in this category credit interest to policyholders  subject to market conditions and minimum guarantees 
policyholders may surrender at book value but are subject to surrender charges for an initial period 
product examples include universal life contracts and the general account portion of the life operations variable annuity products 
liability duration is short to intermediate term 
other insurance products long term pay out liabilities products in this category are long term in nature and may contain significant actuarial including mortality and morbidity pricing and cash flow risks 
the cash flows associated with these policy liabilities are not interest rate sensitive but do vary based on the timing and amount of benefit payments 
the primary risks associated with these products are that the benefits will exceed expected actuarial pricing and or that the actual timing of the cash flows differ from those anticipated resulting in an investment return lower than that assumed in pricing 
product examples include structured settlement contracts  on benefit annuities ie  the annuitant is currently receiving benefits thereon and long term disability contracts 
contract duration is generally to years but  at times  exceeds years 
short term pay out liabilities these liabilities are short term in nature with a duration of less than one year 
the primary risks associated with these products are determined by the non investment contingencies such as mortality or morbidity and the variability in the timing of the expected cash flows 
liquidity is of greater concern than for the long term pay out liabilities 
products include individual and group term life insurance contracts and short term disability contracts 
matching the duration of investments with respective policyholder obligations is an explicit objective of the life operations management strategy 
the estimated cash flows of insurance policy liabilities based upon internal actuarial assumptions as of december  are reflected in the table below by expected maturity year

as of december   the fair value of the life operations investment contracts including guaranteed separate accounts was billion 
sensitivity to changes in interest rates for liabilities whose cash flows are not substantially affected by changes in interest rates fixed liabilities and where investment experience is substantially absorbed by the life operations  the sensitivity of the net economic value discounted present value of asset cash flows less the discounted present value of liability cash flows of those portfolios to basis point shifts in interest rates is shown in the table below 
these fixed liabilities represent about of the life operations general and guaranteed separate account liabilities 
the remaining liabilities generally allow the life operation significant flexibility to adjust credited rates to reflect actual investment experience and thereby pass through a substantial portion of actual investment experience to the policyholder 
the fixed liability portfolios are managed and monitored relative to defined objectives and are analyzed regularly by management for internal risk management purposes using scenario simulation techniques  and evaluated annually consistent with regulatory requirements

as of december   the hartford continued to maintain an equity ownership in hli 
in connection with the offering  the hartford reported a gain related to the increased value of its equity ownership in hli 
management used or will use the proceeds from the offering to reduce certain debt outstanding  to fund growth initiatives and for other general corporate purposes 
the hartford s current intent is to continue to beneficially own at least of hli  but it is under no contractual obligation to do so

the hartford used the proceeds of these additional borrowings to fund the insurance operations of its subsidiaries and to repay outstanding commercial paper and other short term debt 
as of december   the hartford had an unsecured aggregate billion credit facility with twenty seven participating banks which is comprised of a billion five year revolving credit facility with four years remaining and a short term credit facility 
this facility is available for general corporate purposes and to provide additional support to the company s existing commercial paper program

in  the company issued and sold in senior debt securities 
the intended use of the proceeds from the sale of such securities has been and will continue to be primarily for the repayment and or replacement of outstanding commercial paper and other short term debt 
this reflects the hartford s strategy of managing its capital within acceptable ranges of volatility and financial ratings while achieving the lowest long term cost of capital that is reasonably possible 
on october   this shelf registration statement was amended for an additional billion of securities  making an aggregate of billion available for sale

liquidity requirements the liquidity requirements of the hartford have been and will continue to be met by funds from operations as well as the issuance of commercial paper  debt securities and its credit facility 
the principal sources of funds are premiums and investment income as well as maturities and sales of invested assets 
the hartford financial services group  inc is a holding company which receives operating cash flow in the form of dividends from its subsidiaries  enabling it to service debt  pay dividends on the hartford s common stock and pay business expenses 
dividends to the hartford financial services group  inc from its subsidiaries are restricted 
the payment of dividends by connecticut domiciled insurers is limited under the insurance holding company laws of connecticut 
hartford fire adheres to these laws which require notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend  which together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months  exceeds the greater of i of the insurer s policyholder surplus as of december of the preceding year or ii net income or net gain from operations  if such company is a life insurance company for the twelve month period ending on the thirty first day of december last preceding  in each case determined under statutory insurance accounting policies 
in addition  if any dividend of a connecticut domiciled insurer exceeds the insurer s earned surplus  it requires the prior approval of the connecticut insurance commissioner 
the total amount of statutory dividends which may be paid by the insurance subsidiaries of the hartford financial services group  inc in  without prior approval  is the insurance holding company laws of the other jurisdictions in which the hartford s insurance subsidiaries are incorporated or deemed commercially domiciled generally contain similar although in certain instances somewhat more restrictive limitations on the payment of dividends 
the primary uses of funds are to pay claims  policy benefits  operating expenses and commissions  and to purchase new investments 
in addition  the hartford carries a significant short term investment position and accordingly does not anticipate selling intermediate and long term fixed maturity investments to meet any liquidity needs 
for a discussion of the company s investment objectives and strategies  see the investments and capital markets risk management sections 
risk based capital the national association of insurance commissioners naic adopted regulations establishing minimum capitalization requirements based on risk based capital rbc formulas for both property and casualty companies effective december  and life companies effective december  
the requirements consist of formulas which identify companies that are undercapitalized and require specific regulatory actions 
rbc is calculated for property and casualty companies after adjusting capital for certain underwriting  asset  credit and off balance sheet risks 
the rbc formula for life companies establishes capital requirements relating to insurance  business  asset and interest rate risks 
as of december   each of the hartford s insurance subsidiaries within the north american property casualty and life segments had more than sufficient capital to meet the naic s rbc requirements 
cash flow net cash provided by operating activities   net cash used for investing activities    net cash provided by financing activities cash end of year during  cash provided by operating activities increased from the prior year due primarily to strong revenue growth in the life segment combined with lower paid losses at the north american property casualty segment resulting from lower property catastrophe and other severe weather related losses 
cash provided by financing activities increased from the prior year due to proceeds of the offering partially offset by declines in investment type contracts written in the life segment 
the increase in cash used for investing activities reflects the investment of the additional proceeds generated by operating and financing activities 
during  cash provided by operating activities decreased from the prior year due primarily to increased policy acquisition costs related to strong growth in the life segment 
the changes in cash provided by both investing and financing activities between and was primarily due to declines in investment type contracts written in the life segment coupled with increases in investment type contract maturities 
operating cash flows in each of the last three years have been more than adequate to meet liquidity requirements 
omni on february   the hartford completed the purchase of all outstanding shares of omni insurance group  inc omni  a holding company of two non standard auto insurance subsidiaries licensed in states and the district of columbia 
the hartford paid cash of per share  plus transaction costs  for a total of the acquisition will be reported as a purchase transaction and accordingly  the results of omni s operations will be included in the hartford s consolidated financial statements from the closing date of the transaction 
regulatory initiatives and contingencies legislative initiatives although the federal government does not directly regulate the insurance business  federal initiatives often have an impact on the insurance industry in a variety of ways 
current and proposed federal measures which may significantly affect the life insurance business include medical testing for insurability  tax law changes affecting the tax treatment of life insurance products and its impact on the relative desirability of various personal investment vehicles and proposed legislation to prohibit the use of gender in determining insurance and pension rates and benefits 
president clinton s federal budget proposal currently contains certain recommendations for modifying tax rules related to the treatment of variable annuities and coli by contractholders  which if enacted as described  could have a material adverse impact on the company s sales of these products 
it is too early to determine whether these tax proposals will ultimately be enacted by congress and the potential impact  if any  to the company s financial condition or results of operations 
measures which may significantly impact the property and casualty industry include possible modifications to the superfund program  the tax laws governing property and casualty insurance companies  federal catastrophe fund legislation and tort reform proposals 
insolvency fund in all states  insurers licensed to transact certain classes of insurance are required to become members of an insolvency fund 
in most states  in the event of the insolvency of an insurer writing any such class of insurance in the state  all members of the fund are assessed to pay certain claims of the insolvent insurer 
a particular state s fund assesses its members based on their respective written premiums in the state for the classes of insurance in which the insolvent insurer is engaged 
assessments are generally limited for any year to one or two percent of premiums written per year depending on the state 
such assessments paid by the hartford approximated in  in and in naic proposals the naic has been developing several model laws and regulations  including a model investment law and amendments to the model holding company system regulatory act the holding act amendments 
the model investment law defines the investments which are permissible for property and casualty and life insurers to hold  and the holding act amendments address the types of activities in which subsidiaries and affiliates may engage 
the naic adopted these models in and  but the laws have not been enacted for insurance companies domiciled in the state of connecticut  such as hartford fire insurance company 
even if enacted in connecticut or other states in which the hartford s subsidiaries are domiciled  it is expected that these laws will neither significantly change the hartford s investment strategies nor have any material adverse effect on the hartford s liquidity or financial position 
the naic is expected to adopt its codification of statutory accounting principles sap in early with a proposed effective date of january  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa has not yet determined whether sap will qualify as an other comprehensive basis of accounting ocboa 
if sap is granted ocboa status and is adopted by the hartford s domiciliary states  the company will make the necessary changes required for implementation 
these changes are not anticipated to have a material impact on the statutory financial statements of the company 
year the year issue relates to the ability or inability of computer systems to properly process information and data containing or related to dates beginning with the year and beyond 
the year issue exists because  historically  many computer systems that are in use today were developed years ago when a year was identified using a two digit field rather than a four digit field 
as information and data containing or related to the century date are introduced to computer hardware  software and other systems  date sensitive systems may recognize the year as  or not at all  which may result in computer systems processing information incorrectly 
this  in turn  may significantly and adversely affect the integrity and reliability of information databases and may result in a wide variety of adverse consequences to a company 
in addition  year problems that occur with third parties with which a company does business  such as suppliers  computer vendors  distributors and others  may also adversely affect any given company 
as an insurance and financial services company  the hartford has thousands of individual and business customers that have insurance policies  annuities  mutual funds and other financial products of the hartford 
nearly all of these policies and products contain date sensitive data  such as policy expiration dates  birth dates  premium payment dates  and the like 
in addition  the hartford has business relationships with numerous third parties that affect virtually all aspects of the hartford s business  including  without limitation  suppliers  computer hardware and software vendors  insurance agents and brokers  securities broker dealers and other distributors of financial products 
beginning in  the hartford began working on making its computer systems year ready  either through installing new programs or replacing systems 
in january  the hartford commenced a company wide program to further identify  assess and remediate the impact of year problems in the hartford s business segments 
the hartford currently anticipates that this internal program will be substantially completed by the end of  and testing of computer systems will continue through the costs of addressing the year issue that have been incurred by the hartford through the year ended december  have not been material to the hartford s financial condition or results of operations 
the hartford will continue to incur costs related to its year efforts and is in the process of attempting to determine the approximate total costs to be incurred in the future  which costs are not currently anticipated to be material to the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  as part of its year program  the hartford is identifying third parties with which it has significant business relations in order to attempt to assess the potential impact on the hartford of their year issues and remediation plans 
the hartford currently anticipates that it will substantially complete this evaluation by the end of  and will conduct systems testing with certain third parties through the hartford does not have control over these third parties and  as a result  the hartford cannot currently determine to what extent future operating results may be adversely affected by the failure of these third parties to successfully address their year issues 
however  the hartford expects to develop plans to attempt to minimize identified third party exposures 
effect of inflation the rate of inflation as measured by the change in the average consumer price index has not had a material effect on the revenues or operating results of the hartford during the three most recent fiscal years
