as a result of the foregoing  operating income increased in to million from million in liquidity and capital resources the company s primary funding requirements are to finance working capital and the continued growth of the business 
these include the purchase of wholesale and retail inventories in anticipation of increased wholesale sales and new store openings and capital expenditures related to the expansion of retail operations 
the company relies primarily upon internally generated cash flows from operations and borrowings under its line of credit facility to finance its operations and growth 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million and million in and  respectively 
cash used in operations in was million 
at december   working capital was million compared to million at december  cash flows may vary from time to time as a result of seasonal requirements  the timing of the receipt of merchandise from suppliers  the company s open stock inventory program which requires increased inventory levels and the level of accounts receivable balances

the million increase in cash provided by operations in over was primarily attributable to a million reduction in inventory as compared to a million increase in  partially offset by a million decrease in accounts payable compared to a million increase in the company s ongoing focus on inventory management resulted in a reduction in wholesale inventories 
the company sells substantially all of its accounts receivable to two factors without recourse 
in circumstances where a customer s account cannot be factored without recourse  the company may take other measures to reduce its credit exposure which could include requiring the customer to pay in advance or to provide a letter of credit covering the sales price of the merchandise ordered 
the company currently has a line of credit  as amended  under which up to million is available to finance working capital requirements and letters of credit to finance the company s inventory purchases 
borrowings available under the line of credit are determined by a specified percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventories and bear interest at i the higher of the bank of new york s prime lending rate or the federal funds rate plus at the date of borrowing or ii a negotiated rate 
in connection with the line of credit  the company has agreed to eliminate all the outstanding balances under the facility for at least consecutive days during each calendar year 
in addition  borrowings under the line of credit are secured by certain assets of the company 
at december  amounts available under the line of credit were million 
capital expenditures  which were primarily for leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures associated with new store openings  were approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively 
in  the company anticipates opening approximately retail and outlet stores that will require aggregate capital expenditures of approximately million 
the company also expects to spend approximately million for the initial inventory requirements of these new stores 
the company also anticipates that it will require increased capital expenditures to support its continued growth including an increase in its office space and enhancements to its management information systems  particularly in response to the year issue 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
since the company s older computer software programs recognize only the last two digits in the year of any date eg  for  some software may fail to operate properly in or if the software is not reprogrammed or replaced 
this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company determined that it would benefit more by replacing  rather than reprogramming  its wholesale distribution and financial systems with newer technologically advanced systems that offer greater functionality and enhanced reporting 
the company has purchased and installed the new systems and is in the process of implementation 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to perform the implementation and anticipates completing the project on or about december   which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
however  there can be no guarantee that the data and systems will be converted timely and if such conversions are not made  the year issue could have a material impact on the company s operations 
in addition  the company believes that many of its customers also have year issues which  if not timely addressed  could adversely affect the company 
the total cost of the implementation including year issue is estimated at approximately million  which is being funded through both leasing arrangements and operating cash flows 
the retail industry has experienced significant changes and difficulties over the past several years  including consolidation of ownership  increased centralization of buying decisions  restructurings  bankruptcies and liquidations 
although to date these circumstances have not had a material adverse effect on the company  the company cannot predict what effect  if any  continued changes within the retail industry will have on the company s cash flow from operations 
the company believes that it will be able to satisfy its cash requirements for  including requirements for its retail expansion  additional office space and information systems improvements  primarily with cash flow from operations  supplemented by borrowings under its line of credit 
exchange rates the company routinely enters into forward exchange contracts in anticipation of future purchases of inventory denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the italian lira and spanish peseta 
at december   forward exchange contracts totaling million were outstanding with settlement dates ranging from january through july gains and losses on forward exchange contracts are deferred and accounted for as part of the purchase price of imported merchandise 
at december   the unrealized loss on these forward exchange contracts is approximately  the company expects to continue to routinely enter into additional foreign exchange contracts throughout the year 
while the company believes that its current procedures with respect to the reduction of risk associated with currency exchange rate fluctuations is adequate  there can be no assurance that such fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of the company in the future 
inventory purchases from contract manufacturers in the far east are denominated in united states dollars and the recent devaluation of many of these currencies against the united states dollar has not had any material impact on the company 
however  future purchase prices for the company s products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturer  which may effect the company s cost of goods in the future 
the company does not believe the potential effects of such fluctuations would have a material adverse affect on the company 
effects of inflation the company does not believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation experienced over the last few years in the united states  where it primarily competes  have had a significant effect on revenues or profitability
