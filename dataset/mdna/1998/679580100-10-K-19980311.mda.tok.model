impact of the year some of the company s older software applications were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  that software may interpret a date using as the year rather than the year this could possibly cause a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in normal business activities
