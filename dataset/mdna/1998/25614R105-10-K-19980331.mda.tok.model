the highly portable autograph software platform enables cost effective  just in time  on demand  high volume publishing that is fully automated  capable of quality document composition  and flexible for enduser customization 
the company s products are used in a wide array of computing environments from client server to large computer systems 
products the company s autograph family of products currently addresses three major functional areas document composition and assembly  document management  and document viewing  as described below 
all of the company s software products can be complemented by the company s professional services organization 
the list price for an initial license fee for compuset  the company s core product  is currently  for an initial mainframe installation and ranges down to  for an initial single pc  options currently range from  to  the company licenses its products for one year  after which an annual renewal fee  usually in an amount equal to of the initial license fee  is required for continued use 
a typical new sale is currently about  for software licenses and approximately  for professional services 
document composition and assembly composition and assembly 
compuset  the company s flagship product  automates document composition and assembly using data and information in corporate databases 
it is the company s core technology 
compuset software consists of a rulebased language and a composition engine that provide high speed composition and assembly of complex documents with high typographic and aesthetic levels of quality 
information content is marked with compuset tags which  in turn  are defined in logically separate style specifications 
without requiring real time user interaction  the composition engine then transforms the tagged data and information into finished electronic documents that can be composed and assembled at rates in excess of pages per second  depending on computing configuration and complexity of the document 
document construction facilities are extensive  including the full support of dynamic data driven graphics generation 
compuset operates on a range of computers and operating systems including mainframes  workstations  network servers and personal computers 
data capture and setup 
data capture and setup products include compuprep and a number of importers  and prepare data and information for subsequent composition and assembly by compuset 
compuprep is an optional tool that enables users to capture and tag raw data and information from a variety of sources  including corporate databases  for subsequent processing by compuset 
it is a high level language that describes the data environment  related data processing and the tagging instructions for compuset 
importers accept externally generated document objects  including text  static graphics and scanned images  and convert them into formats compatible with compuset 
the importers support adobe postscript  xerox metacode and the tiff standard for scanned images 
document output and merge 
emitters transform compuset s output into a number of popular page description languages pdls for printing and viewing 
the pdls provide instructions for rendering text  forms  bitmaps  and graphics into documents 
the pdl formats currently supported are xerox metacode  ibm afpds  and adobe postscript 
this part of the architecture is extensible and new emitters can be provided as required 
application development tools 
compuseries application development tools run on microsoft windows r and simplify document design and application prototyping 
compuseries currently consists of several modules 
compuspec is a tool for defining document formatting rules 
formatting specifications which are selected from a menu are associated with tags which are referenced in the document data 
the results of the selected formatting specifications are visually displayed in a preview window 
compubuild uses a pc version of compuset  combined with an editor to manipulate the tagged document data 
compubuild supports all the dynamic functions and features of the compuset production engine 
compumerge is a tool used to specify the placement of variable data into fixed document components such as in form fill applications 
compuview proof is a document proofing tool used to preview the document layout on the computer screen prior to printing 
these tools were integrated into a single windows application  called compuseries ii 
the company is in beta testing to oem jetform r corporation s jetform design product as well as the jetform production print drivers for metacode  postscript and afp printers  and will integrate it with compuseries ii 
document management document management tools provide client server solutions for the creation  revision and management of document components used in the company s document automation solutions 
they consist of the document library service dls and desktop document manager ddm 
dls manages the document component creation process required by complex variable documents 
in addition  dls can be used to define complex assembly rules required for interactive or fully automated document composition and assembly with compuset 
dls uses a client server architecture for accessing data and files on a mainframe or network server 
ddm is the client component of dls and manages text objects created with microsoft word r 
text objects are tracked and managed in a multi author environment by providing access security  revision control and approval levels 
ddm also provides a criteria based document object selection capability for customized or personalized documents 
these criteria are then used by dls to generate a compuset ready tagged data file 
the customized or personalized document assembly can be directed to occur in a high volume fashion on the server or in a just in time  on demand fashion on the local ddm pc 
document viewing document viewing enables on line viewing and archiving of electronic documents produced by document automation applications 
it consists of document viewing service dvs and compuview 
dvs uses a client server architecture for the creation and access of electronic document files 
dvs is available for a variety of mainframe  unix and pc platforms 
the electronic document files are generated in a format called composite container format ccf  which is optimized for fast  memory efficient viewing  transport and storage 
ccf files can then be viewed by compuview 
ccf files consist of three major components a page description language pdl rendition of the pages for wysiwyg viewing  various indices for locating documents  and reusable document elements 
ccf files can also be distributed  archived or printed through document distribution and archiving systems offered by third party software developers that have integrated compuview 
compuview is a windows application for viewing ccf files 
the view of the document is virtually identical to the printed document 
compuview may also be integrated with third party document retrieval systems 
the company introduced dvs in october and entered into several oem agreements in to have the program incorporated into archiving software distributed by other major vendors 
the company is considering possible future internet extensions  some of which are not currently under active development 
the company believes that its core technology can be extended to the internet  intranets and commercial online services and has recently begun initial development activity in this area  although there can be no assurance that such development activity will result in commercially successful products 
see business research and development 
professional services in addition to its software products  the company provides a comprehensive suite of services which can assist customers in the implementation of enterprise wide and mission critical document automation applications 
professional services include on site software installation  customer training programs  telephone support programs and consulting services 
consulting services are currently focusing on assisting in the sale of high margin initial software licenses by providing project management and application development 
eventually  the company intends to expand professional services to include document design  systems design and integration 
in addition to consulting services  the company currently offers introductory level customer education  which is included with compuset initial licenses 
additional and advanced classes are provided for additional fees at the company s headquarters in san diego and at customer sites 
the company offers advanced and specialized customer education in response to the unique needs of certain customers 
the company believes that expanded professional services enables customers to deploy the company s document automation products more rapidly and effectively  and assist the company in the development of new products and provide recurring revenue 
the professional services and support organizations employed a staff of as of december  sales and marketing the company s sales and marketing organization targets vertical industry markets that require document automation and high volume document personalization and customization 
the company currently licenses its products using a combination of direct sales and alternate channels 
in the united states  the company markets its products through a direct sales force 
sales representatives are provided with pre sales technical support by regional application specialists 
sales representatives and the regional application specialists are located in atlanta  chicago  cincinnati  dallas  minneapolis  new york city  pittsburgh  richmond  raleigh  sacramento  yorba linda  san antonio  san diego  seattle and washington  dc the company distributes its products through value added reseller var relationships with xerox canada  ltd 
in canada  fuji xerox co  ltd 
in australia  and xerox brazil  ltd 
in brazil 
the company s subsidiary  document sciences europe  markets and supports the company s products in europe  africa and the middle east by providing channel management  technical support  consulting and training services  and defining european market and product requirements 
the company licenses its products in europe through vars and  to a lesser extent  direct sales 
the vars are principally rank xerox ltd 
and other xerox affiliates who remarket the company s products 
the company s revenues from export transactions with xerox affiliates were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the sales  marketing  consulting and customer support organization employed a staff of as of december  the company intends to expand its sales and marketing organization to provide direct sales and support services throughout the world 
such planned expansion will occur by first addressing the unique product requirements of a region followed by developing indirect sales channels to market in the region 
as the company is able to increase its market presence  it may then augment its alternate channels with a direct sales capability 
in addition  the company intends to increase both its product offerings and markets through marketing  sales and distribution  and development relationships with other companies 
current relationships include formal and informal marketing and sales alliances with xerox  ibm  oce printing systems  computer associates  new dimension software  rsd  jetform corporation  systemware  and anacomp 
these relationships provide sales leads for the company s products and have extended the company s sales coverage and networking capabilities 
research and development in general  the company s strategy is to build products that augment and extend the document composition and assembly capabilities of its core products 
initially  product development investments were primarily focused on completing the autograph family of products  which included delivering products for document viewing as well as adding support for additional print environments 
in addition  there was a substantial investment in product maintenance and in software integration  testing  and documentation 
the company supplements its product development efforts by reviewing customer feedback on existing products and working with customers and potential customers to anticipate future product needs 
to date  the company s autograph family of products have been applied mainly to document automation applications producing paper based documents 
the company believes that its core technology can be extended to provide electronic document automation for the internet  intranets  and commercial on line services 
the short term strategy is to engage this emerging opportunity with two complementary initiatives 
first  the company intends to work closely to define product requirements with existing customers  many of whom have expressed interest in using the internet in their document automation solutions 
second  the company intends to develop incremental extensions to its autograph family of products which can be incorporated by current customers into existing document automation products provided by the company 
the company believes that its core technology can be extended to the internet  intranets and commercial on line services  and has only recently begun initial development activity in this area 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing  introducing and marketing new products on a timely and cost effective basis  if at all  or that new products will achieve market acceptance 
the development organization is composed of self directed teams  in which representatives from various disciplines within the company collectively take responsibility for the development and delivery of each new feature or product 
the development process includes early review of prototypes and demonstrations to incorporate customer feedback and provide an opportunity for management review 
a formal sequence of project phases organizes the development and review process for each team 
the company has a formal release planning process for an annual maintenance release  and delivers interim versions as needed to support its customers 
the development organization maintains a database of all customer and internal requests which forms the basis for release planning 
the company expects to continue to enhance its existing products and to develop new products  particularly as they relate to electronic publishing applications 
research and development expenditures have grown substantially since the company s inception 
such expenditures were million in  million in and million in these amounts do not include product support activities 
the development organization has grown from in to in and in the company employs independent contractors as needed to supplement the permanent development staff 
competition the market for the company s document automation products is intensely competitive  subject to rapid change  and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
the company s software products are targeted at document intensive organizations that require the ability to produce large quantities of customized and personalized documents in paper or electronic form 
the company faces direct and indirect competition from a broad range of competitors who offer a variety of products and solutions to the company s current and potential customers 
the company s principal competition currently comes from i systems developed in house by the internal mis departments of large organizations  ii direct competition in a number of its vertical markets  including docucorp  which is partially owned by xerox  in the insurance industry  m i data services  inc in banking and financial services  and group software  inc in commercial direct mailing  and iii direct competitors such as ibm s direct composition facility dcf and group s recently introduced doc product 
the company faces market resistance from the large installed base of legacy systems because of the reluctance of these customers to commit the time and effort necessary to convert their document automation processes to the company s document automation software 
several of the company s competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than the company  greater name recognition and a larger installed base of customers 
it is also possible that the company will face competition from new competitors 
these include large independent software companies offering personal computer based application software solutions  such as microsoft corporation and adobe corporation  and from large corporations providing database management software solutions  such as oracle corporation 
in addition  xerox  either directly or through affiliated entities  could compete with the company 
moreover  as the market for document automation software develops  a number of these or other companies with significantly greater resources than the company could attempt to enter or increase their presence in the company s market either independently or by acquiring or forming strategic alliances with competitors of the company or to otherwise increase their focus on the industry 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products to address the needs of the company s current and prospective customers 
it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by the company will not materially adversely affect its business  operating results and financial condition 
the company believes that the principal competitive factors affecting its market include product performance and functionality  ease of use  scalability  operation across multiple computer and operating system platforms  product and company reputation  client service and support  and price 
although the company believes that it currently competes favorably with respect to such factors  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its competitive position against current and future competitors or that the company will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products or solutions introduced by existing competitors or by new companies entering the market 
further  there can be no assurance that the company can maintain its position against current and future competitors  especially those with greater financial  marketing  service  support  technical and other resources than the company 
patents and proprietary rights the company s success is dependent  in part  on its ability to protect its proprietary technology 
the company relies primarily on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights 
the company seeks to protect its software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection 
the company presently has no patents or patent applications pending 
despite the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of the company s products or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of the company s products is difficult  and while the company is unable to determine the extent to which piracy of its software products exists  software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
there can be no assurance that the company s means of protecting its proprietary rights will be adequate or that the company s competitors will not independently develop similar technology 
the company is not aware that any of its products infringes upon the proprietary rights of third parties 
there can be no assurance  however  that third parties will not claim infringement by the company with respect to current or future products 
the company expects that software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the company s industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to the company or at all  which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the company also relies on certain software that it licenses from third parties  including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in the company s products to perform key functions 
there can be no assurances that such firms will remain in business  that they will continue to support their products or that their products will otherwise continue to be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms 
the loss or inability to maintain any of these software licenses could result in delays or reductions in product shipments until equivalent software can be developed  identified  licensed and integrated  which would adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
employees as of december   the company had employees including in sales  marketing  consulting and customer support  in research and development  and in finance and administration 
none of the company s employees are represented by a labor union 
the company has experienced no work stoppages and believes its relationship with its employees is good 
competition for qualified personnel in the industry in which the company competes is intensive 
the company believes that its future success will depend in part on its continued ability to attract  hire  and retain qualified personnel 
certain additional business risks the company s business  financial condition and operating results may be impacted by a number of factors  including but not limited to those set forth below  any one of which could cause the company s actual results to vary materially from recent results or from the company s anticipated future results 
limited operating history 
the company was incorporated in october as a wholly owned subsidiary of xerox  and xerox currently owns approximately of the company s outstanding shares of common stock 
the company s limited operating history makes the prediction of future operating results difficult  and the company s operating history during prior periods cannot necessarily be regarded as indicative of the company s prospects as an independent company  especially in light of the company s investments in sales  marketing  professional services and development infrastructure 
accordingly  although the company has experienced revenue growth in recent years  there can be no assurance that the company will sustain such growth in revenues  if any  or that the company will remain profitable on a quarterly or annual basis 
uncertainty of future operating results  fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
the company s total revenues and operating results can vary  sometimes substantially  from quarter to quarter and are expected to vary significantly in the future 
the company s revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast 
future results will depend upon many factors  including the demand for the company s products  the level of product and price competition  the length of the company s sales cycle  the size and timing of individual license transactions  the delay or deferral of customer implementations  the budget cycles of the company s customers  the level of commissions on the sale of xerox printers under the strategic marketing alliance between the company and xerox  the company s success in expanding its direct sales force and indirect distribution channels  the timing of new product introductions and product enhancements by the company and its competitors  the mix of products and services sold  levels of international sales  activities of and acquisitions by competitors  the timing of new hires  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  the ability of the company to develop and market new products and control costs and general domestic and international economic conditions 
in addition  the company s sales generally reflect relatively high revenue per order  and the loss or delay of individual orders  therefore  could have a significant impact on the revenues and quarterly operating results of the company 
moreover  the timing of license revenue is difficult to predict because of the length of the company s sales cycle  which is typically three to twelve months from the initial customer contact 
the company s initial software license products generally are shipped as orders are received 
as a result  initial license fee revenues are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
because the company s operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and because a high percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  a delay in the recognition of revenue from a limited number of license transactions could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in losses 
to the extent such expenses precede increased revenues  the company s operating results would be materially adversely affected 
the company s business has experienced and is expected to continue to experience seasonality  in part due to customer purchasing patterns and the company s expense patterns 
the company believes that fourth quarter revenues are positively impacted by year end capital purchases by large corporate customers and strong fourth quarter sales of printers by xerox which may generate sales of the company s products  as well as the company s sales compensation plans 
as reflected in the fourth quarter of  these seasonal factors have historically resulted in fourth quarter revenues being substantially higher than revenues in the preceding three quarters  as well as being higher than revenues in each of the first two quarters of the next year 
in addition  a significant amount of the company s revenues occur predominantly in the third month of each fiscal quarter and tend to be concentrated in the latter half of the third month 
as a result of these factors  revenues for any quarter are subject to significant variation  and the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
furthermore  due to all of the foregoing factors  it is likely that in some future quarter the company s operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
see expansion of sales and distribution channels below  and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
control by xerox 
xerox owns approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock of the company 
consequently  xerox controls the company  is able to elect the entire board of directors of the company and continues to have significant input into the company s operations 
in addition  xerox is able to determine the outcome of all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  including potential mergers  acquisitions  consolidations and sales of all or substantially all of the assets of the company 
the voting power of xerox could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the company  and may prevent or discourage tender offers for the company s common stock at a premium price by another person or entity 
at present  xerox affiliates hold three of the five seats on the company s board of directors 
see reliance on relationships with xerox  lack of independent sales and marketing channels below 
reliance on relationships with xerox  lack of independent sales and marketing channels 
the company currently has a variety of contractual and informal relationships with xerox and affiliates of xerox  including a cooperative marketing agreement  a transfer and license agreement and various distribution agreements 
the company relies on these relationships and agreements for a significant portion of its total revenues 
in  and  total revenues derived from relationships with xerox and affiliates of xerox accounted for approximately million  million and million  representing  and of the company s total revenues  respectively 
further  the commissions received by the company from sales of xerox printers under the strategic marketing alliance  which were  million  and  in  and  respectively  have little or no associated costs  have contributed a substantial portion of the company s income from operations and net income for certain prior operating periods  have had a high degree of inconsistency from quarter to quarter and are difficult to estimate 
failure to continue to receive such commissions would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
although neither xerox nor its affiliated entities has expressed to the company any intention to terminate their respective agreements with the company  these agreements generally may be terminated on no more than days notice 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that xerox or its affiliates will continue these relationships or  if they do  that they will be on terms favorable to the company 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that existing and potential customers will not be deterred by the existence of these relationships or by the historical ties between the company and xerox and its affiliates 
though the company intends to continue its existing relationships with xerox  the company s strategy is to lessen its dependence on xerox 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so and  because of the company s current level of dependence on xerox  there can be no assurance that the company s transition to a more independent company will not adversely affect its business  financial condition or results of operations 
the failure by the company to maintain these relationships  particularly with xerox and its affiliates  or to establish new relationships in the future  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and expansion of sales and distribution channels below 
xerox has strategic alliances and other business relationships with other companies who supply software and services used in high volume electronic publishing applications and who now or in the future may be a competitor of the company 
xerox could in the future expand these relationships or enter into additional ones  and as a result the company s business could be materially adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that xerox or one of its affiliated companies will not engage in business directly competitive with the company 
in addition  xerox has on going internal development activities which could in the future lead to products that compete with the company 
expansion of sales and distribution channels 
the company has substantially increased expenditures in support of its strategy to expand its global marketing  sales and customer support infrastructure in order to expand the market for the company s products by providing direct sales and support services and increased channel distribution throughout the major markets of the world 
through this expansion  the company hopes to lessen its dependence on xerox and certain xerox affiliates 
in addition  the company intends to increase both its product offerings and markets through marketing  sales and distribution and development relationships with other companies 
the company intends to increase the number of these strategic relationships as well as form alliances with system integrators and consultants 
whether the company can successfully generate its own sales leads  introduce new products and enter into new markets will depend on its ability to expand its direct sales and support services  expand its indirect channel distribution  and increase its relationships and alliances with other companies 
as a result of its planned expansion  the company has and will continue to incur significant costs to build such corporate infrastructure ahead of anticipated revenues  and any failure to achieve growth in revenues in excess of increased expenses would have a material adverse affect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully expand its direct sales and support services force  expand its indirect channel distribution  or establish or maintain successful third party relationships 
any failure to do so will have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on success of new products and expansion of professional services 
the company s autograph family of products have been applied mainly to document automation applications producing paper based documents 
the company believes its core technology can be extended to address applications requiring the delivery of customized and personalized electronic documents over electronic networks such as the internet  intranets or commercial on line services 
the company began shipping document viewing service dvs  an optional on line viewer for electronic documents produced by document automation application in october document library services dls  an optional document management tool  was released for general availability in september prior to september  dls was in a limited release  with certain configurations still in beta testing 
revenues for dvs were million in and  in revenues for dls were million in and million in revenues for dvs and dls were insignificant in in addition  the company is increasing its focus on the consulting services component of its professional services to assist customers in the planning and implementation of enterprise wide  mission critical document automation applications 
the company has directed a significant amount of its product development expenditures to the on going development of dvs and dls and plans to devote a significant amount of future sales and marketing resources to the full commercial introduction of dvs and dls 
the company believes that the long term growth of license and service revenue will be dependent  in part  upon the success of dvs  dls and the expansion of professional services 
the company has limited experience in developing new products 
because of such limited experience  there can be no assurance that dvs and dls will not require substantial software enhancements or modifications to satisfy performance requirements of clients or to correct design defects 
further  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in expanding its consulting services as part of its professional services 
if clients experience significant problems with implementation of the software or are otherwise dissatisfied with the functionality or performance of dvs and dls  or if dvs or dls fails to achieve market acceptance for any reason  or if the company fails to successfully expand its professional services  the company s business  operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
lengthy sales and implementation cycles 
the license of the company s software products is often an enterprise wide decision by prospective customers and generally requires the company to engage in a lengthy sales cycle  typically between three and twelve months  to provide a significant level of education to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of the company s products 
in addition  the implementation of the company s products by customers involves a significant commitment of resources by such customers over an extended period of time  and is commonly associated with substantial customer business process reengineering efforts 
for these and other reasons  the sales and customer implementation cycles are subject to a number of significant delays over which the company has little or no control 
delay in the sale or customer implementation of a limited number of license transactions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations and cause the company s operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
product concentration 
the company derived of its initial license revenues from licenses of compuset and related compuset option products in initial license fees from dvs and dls comprised and  respectively  in as a result  factors adversely affecting the pricing of or demand for compuset and related products  such as competition from other products  negative publicity or obsolesce of the hardware or software environments in which the company s products run  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s financial performance will continue to depend  in significant part  on the successful development  introduction and customer acceptance of new and enhanced versions of the compuset software and related products 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in developing and marketing compuset products and related services 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
industry concentration 
licenses to end users in the insurance and commercial print services industries for  and accounted for  and respectively  of total revenues 
the future success of the company will depend on its ability to continue to successfully market its products in such industries  and to successfully market its products in other industries 
the failure of the company to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on new products and product enhancements 
the company s future business  operating results and financial condition will continue to depend upon its ability to develop new products that address the future needs of its target markets and to respond to emerging industry standards and practices 
the company believes that its core technology can be extended to the internet  intranets and commercial on line services  and has begun initial development activity in this area 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing  introducing and marketing new products or product enhancements  including new products or the extension of existing products for the internet  intranets and commercial on line services  on a timely and cost effective basis  if at all  or that its new products and product enhancements will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance 
delays in the commencement of commercial shipments of new products or enhancements  including dvs and dls  may result in client dissatisfaction and delay or loss of product revenues 
if the company is unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new products or enhancements of existing products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or client requirements  or if new products or new versions of existing products do not achieve market acceptance  the company s business  operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
in order to provide its customers with integrated product solutions  the company s future success will also depend in part upon its ability to maintain and enhance relationships with its technology partners  such as computer associates  jetform corporation  anacomp and new dimension software 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
international operations 
revenues from export sales  including sales through its foreign subsidiary accounted for  and of the company s total revenues in  and  respectively 
the company s wholly owned subsidiary  document sciences europe  markets and supports the company s products in europe 
the company licenses its products in europe through value added resellers vars and to a lesser extent  direct sales 
the vars are principally xerox affiliates who re market the company s products 
in australia  canada and brazil the company distributes its products through fuji xerox co  ltd  xerox canada  ltd  and xerox brazil  ltd  respectively 
revenues generated by these xerox affiliates were million  million and million in  and the  respectively 
in  a substantial portion of the company s revenues from export sales were generated through entities affiliated with xerox 
in order to successfully expand export sales  the company must establish additional foreign operations  hire additional personnel and develop relationships with additional international resellers 
to the extent that the company is unable to do so in a timely manner  the company s growth  if any  in international export sales will be limited  and the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for its products 
additional risks inherent in the company s international business activities generally include currency fluctuations  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  costs of and the company s limited experience in localizing products for foreign countries  lack of acceptance of localized products in foreign countries  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  difficulties in managing international operations  potentially adverse tax consequences including restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
a portion of the company s business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the french franc 
although to date exchange rate fluctuations have not had a significant impact on the company  fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which the company conducts its business relative to the us dollar could cause currency transaction gains and losses in future periods 
the company does not currently engage in currency hedging transactions  and there can be no assurance that fluctuations in the currency exchange rates in the future will not have a material adverse impact on international revenues and thus the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
there can be no assurance that such factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future international operations and  consequently  the company s results of operations

dependence on emerging markets for document automation software 
the market for document automation software is relatively new  intensely competitive  highly fragmented  underdeveloped and subject to rapid change 
marketing and sales techniques in the document automation software marketplace  as well as the bases for competition  are not well established 
there can be no assurance that the market for document automation software will develop or that  if it does develop  organizations will adopt the company s products 
the company has spent  and intends to continue to spend  significant resources educating potential customers about the benefits of its products 
however  there can be no assurance that such expenditures will enable the company s products to achieve further market acceptance  and if the document automation software market fails to develop or develops more slowly than the company currently anticipates  the company s business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the commercial market for document automation of electronic documents designed for use with the internet  intranets and commercial on line services has only recently begun to develop  and the success of the company s products designed for this market will depend  in part  on their compatibility with such services 
it is difficult to predict with any assurance whether the internet  intranets and commercial on line services will prove to be a viable commercial marketplace or whether the demand for related products and services will increase or decrease in the future 
since the increased commercial use of the internet  intranets and commercial on line services could require substantial modification and customization of certain of the company s products and services and the introduction of new products and services  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively or successfully compete in this emerging market 
management of change  dependence upon key personnel 
the company has recently experienced a period of growth in total revenues 
the company s ability to compete effectively and to manage future change will require the company to continue to improve its financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures on a timely basis and to expand  train and manage its employee work force 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so successfully 
the company s failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of its key technical  sales and senior management personnel  none of whom are parties to employment agreements with the company 
the loss of the services of one or more of the company s executive officers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s future success also depends on its continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified product development  sales and managerial personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain its key employees or that it will be able to attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified product development  sales and managerial personnel in the future 
see control by xerox above 
recent changes in senior management 
on march   the company announced the retirement of tony n 
domit from his positions as president and chief executive officer  and that a committee of the company s board of directors had been established to conduct a search for mr 
domit s replacement 
while the company intends to name a new president and chief executive officer as soon as practicable  there can be no assurance that the change in senior management and related uncertainties will not adversely affect the company s consolidated operating results and financial condition during the period until a new president and chief executive officer is hired and afterward 
the company s failure to recruit  retain and assimilate new executives  or the failure of any such executive to perform effectively  or the loss of any such executive  could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
year compliance 
many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
beginning in the year  these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  in fewer than two years  computer systems and or software used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
significant uncertainty exists concerning the potential effects associated with such compliance 
any year compliance problem of any of the company  its customers  or its suppliers could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
product liability 
the company s license agreements with its customers typically contain provisions designed to limit the company s exposure to potential product liability claims 
however  it is possible that the limitation of liability provisions contained in the company s license agreements may not be effective under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
although the company has not experienced any product liability claims to date  the sale and support of products by the company may entail the risk of such claims  and there can be no assurance that the company will not be subject to such claims in the future 
a successful product liability claim or claim arising as a result of professional services rendered by the company brought against the company could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
risk of product defects 
software products as complex as those offered by the company  particularly the company s new dvs and dls products  may contain undetected defects or errors when first introduced or as new versions are released 
as a result  the company could in the future lose or delay recognition of revenues as a result of software errors or defects 
in addition  the company s products are typically intended for use in applications that may be critical to a customer s business 
as a result  the company expects that its customers and potential customers have a greater sensitivity to product defects than the market for software products generally 
although the company s business has not been adversely affected by any such errors to date  there can be no assurance that  despite testing by the company and by current and potential customers  errors will not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance  diversion of development resources  damage to the company s reputation  or increased service and warranty costs  any of which would have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition

revenues from commissions paid by xerox in connection with the sale of xerox printer products are recognized upon installation of the printer products 
revenues generated from consulting and training services are recognized as the related services are performed 
the growth of total revenue in each year was due primarily to increased numbers of initial software license customers and growth in services and other revenue  and to the expansion of the company s sales force and product consultants 
the company sells its products principally through a direct sales force domestically  and internationally principally through distributors and value added resellers vars and  to a lesser extent  through its direct sales force 
revenues from export sales and sales through the company s foreign subsidiary were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing increases of from to and from to revenue from export sales were  and of total revenue for the  and  respectively 
the increase in total export revenue is due to the company s increased presence in foreign markets and the continued success of the foreign subsidiary in europe which was established in this growth has not paralleled the domestic growth since professional services have been generally performed by vars in these markets

cost of initial licenses of software includes documentation  reproduction costs  product packaging  packaging design  product media  employment costs for training  installation and distribution personnel  the cost of third party software and amortization of previously capitalized software development costs

cost of annual licenses renewals revenues was   and  in  and  respectively  representing  and of annual licenses renewals revenues

the company expenses all costs for research and development of new products until technological feasibility has been assured 
thereafter  costs of production are capitalized until general release of the product 
the capitalized costs of software production are amortized using the greater of the amount computed using the ratio of current product revenues to estimated total product revenues or the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic lives of the products 
the company capitalized software development costs of   and  in  and  respectively 
the increase in capitalized software development costs in compared to was principally due to the expansion of the engineering staff and increased costs due to the development of software that has reached technological feasibility as compared to prior periods when there were enhancements to existing products

interest income expense  net 
interest income expense is primarily composed of interest income from cash and cash equivalents and short term investments offset by financing charges related to equipment leases 
interest income expense  net was   and  in  and  respectively 
the increase in dollar amount is primarily due to higher cash balances resulting from the infusion of cash from the company s initial public offering of common stock completed in september provision for income taxes 
effective tax rates were approximately  and in  and  respectively 
these rates differ from the federal statutory rate in primarily due to the benefits received from certain credits and to benefits received from tax exempt interest income 
during the company recognized a benefit from a net operating loss carryforward from the company s foreign subsidiary 
from its inception to september   the company s operating results were included in the consolidated tax returns of xerox corporation 
subsequent to the company s initial public offering on september   the company was no longer included in the consolidated tax returns of xerox corporation 
factors that may affect future operating results the company s total revenues and operating results can vary  sometimes substantially  from quarter to quarter and are expected to vary significantly in the future 
the company s revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast 
future results will depend upon many factors  including the demand for the company s products  the level of product and price competition  the length of the company s sales cycle  the size and timing of individual license transactions  the delay or deferral of customer implementations  the budget cycles of the company s customers  the company s success in expanding its direct sales force and indirect distribution channels  the timing of new product introductions and product enhancements by the company and its competitors  the mix of products and services sold  levels of international sales  activities of and acquisitions by competitors  the timing of new hires  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  the ability of the company to develop and market new products and control costs  and general domestic and international economic conditions 
in addition  the company s sales generally reflect a relatively high amount of revenues per order  and  therefore  the loss or delay of individual orders could have a significant impact on revenues and quarterly operating results of the company 
in addition  a significant amount of the company s revenues occur predominantly in the third month of each fiscal quarter and tend to be concentrated in the latter half of that third month 
the company s software products generally are shipped as orders are received 
as a result  initial license revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
the timing of receipt of initial license revenue is difficult to predict because of the length of the company s sales cycle  which is typically three to twelve months from the initial contact 
because the company s operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue trends and because a high percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  a delay in the recognition of revenue from a limited number of initial license transactions could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in losses 
to the extent such expenses precede  or are not subsequently followed by  increased revenues  the company s operating results would be materially adversely affected 
due to the foregoing factors  revenues and operating results for any quarter are subject to significant variation  and the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
net cash provided by operating activities was million and million in and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities was  in net cash used in investing activities was  and million in and  respectively

net cash provided by investing activities was million in in net cash provided by financing activities was  primarily from issuance of the company s common stock pursuant to exercise of options granted under the employee stock option plan  offset by payments of capital lease obligations 
net cash provided by financing activities in was million  primarily from net proceeds from the initial public offering of the company s common stock 
net cash used in financing activities was  in  primarily from the purchase of treasury stock 
the company believes that its existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures at least through the next twelve months 
a portion of the company s cash could be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
the company is currently evaluating  in its ordinary course of business  potential investments such as businesses  products or technologies 
the company has no current understandings  commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisition of other businesses  products or technologies

year compliance the company has determined that it will need to modify or replace significant portions of its software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and beyond 
the company also intends to initiate discussions with its significant suppliers  large customers and financial institutions to ensure that those parties have appropriate plans to remediate year issues where their systems interface with the company s systems or otherwise impact its operations 
the company plans to assess the extent to which its operations are vulnerable should those organizations fail to remediate properly their computer systems 
the company will verify that activities are designed to ensure that there is no adverse effect on the company s core business operations and that transactions with customers  suppliers and financial institutions are fully supported 
the company expects to have all necessary changes implemented by while the company believes its planning efforts are adequate to address its year concerns  there can be no guarantee that the company s systems or the systems of other companies on which the company s systems and operations rely will be converted on a timely basis and will not have a material effect on the company 
the cost of the year initiatives is not expected to be material to the company s results of operations or financial position
