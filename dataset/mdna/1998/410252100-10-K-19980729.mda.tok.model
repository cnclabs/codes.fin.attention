item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company operates principally in one business segment selling music  video  book and personal computer software products primarily to mass merchants  and also to specialty chain stores  drugstores and supermarkets 
on june   handleman s board of directors approved a comprehensive strategic repositioning program designed to focus on the company s core music distribution business and product line 
the repositioning program has four major components 
exiting the domestic video  book and software distribution and service operations 

sale of sofsource  north coast entertainment s software publishing subsidiary 

significant reduction in the number of customers serviced in the music business 

repurchase in the open market of up to million of the outstanding common stock of handleman company over months 
this repurchase program is subject to the realization of cash from asset sales and reduced working capital needs  as well as renegotiation of existing credit facilities 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company sold its book distribution business and sofsource 
the book distribution business was sold at approximately net book value and the sofsource sale generated a pre tax gain in excess of million 
handleman plans to exit its domestic video and software distribution business activities  as well as to cease providing services to smaller customers in the music distribution business 
this is in addition to the sale of the book distribution business noted above 
the decision was made to exit these activities  as well as to reduce the number of customers serviced in the music distribution business  because these businesses or customers either did not provide an appropriate and consistent rate of return or do not have the potential for sustainable growth and profitability 
in addition to the business activities being exited  the company is reviewing its operations in argentina  brazil and mexico to determine how best to maximize shareholder value from these entities 
decisions will be made with respect to each of these markets and announced by the end of august management expects the repositioning activities to be substantially completed during fiscal the program is expected to generate cash flow exceeding million from the sale of assets and a reduction in working capital 
upon completion of the repositioning actions  the company expects to realize annual ongoing cost savings in excess of million pre tax 
the expected savings will result from a reduction in operating costs at a rate that is greater than the projected decrease in revenues  because both average customer size and average sales volume of departments serviced increase significantly 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recognized a million pre tax charge representing principally costs associated with closing the albany and atlanta warehouses which were consolidated into the indianapolis automated distribution center and the impairment of certain investments  as well as already incurred repositioning related costs 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company expects to recognize additional nonrecurring charges of million to million pre tax for the following items 
severance and related benefit costs for employees being terminated 

reduction to net realizable value of assets in those business activities being exited 

write off of intangibles related to business activities being exited 

costs related to restructuring the company s debt financing arrangements and other costs related to repositioning activities 
these charges will result in the company incurring a substantial loss in the first quarter and for all of fiscal repositioning related charges after the first quarter are expected to not exceed million pre tax 
benefits are expected to begin in the second fiscal quarter as the program is implemented 
this repositioning program will result in a reduction of  positions approximately of the company s total workforce 
this reduction will occur predominantly in the handleman entertainment resources division and the troy corporate headquarters 
handleman will continue to operate its north coast entertainment subsidiary 
the company is confident about the prospects at north coast entertainment and is committed to growing the business  as evidenced by the may acquisition of a majority interest in the itsy bitsy entertainment company  inc  an entertainment marketing firm with exclusive rights to a number of childrens properties 
at this time there are no plans to divest any north coast businesses other than the completed sale of sofsource 
in connection with the repositioning program  the board of directors approved the repurchase in the open market of up to million of the company s common stock over months 
this repurchase program will be subject to the generation of cash from the sale of assets and reduced working capital needs  as well as the renegotiation of the company s existing credit agreements 
in september the board authorized a program to repurchase up to million shares  of which million shares had been acquired as of may  at a cost of approximately million 
this program has been replaced by the new repurchase program 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on the repositioning program 
comparison of with for the fiscal year ended may  fiscal  revenues decreased to billion from billion for the fiscal year ended may  fiscal  primarily as a result of lower sales in the video distribution business

the company s fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to april th 
fiscal consisted of weeks  whereas fiscal consisted of weeks 
management believes the inclusion of one additional week in fiscal did not have a material effect on results of operations for fiscal the company has three operating units handleman entertainment resources her  north coast entertainment nce and handleman international international 
her is a category manager of music  video  book and personal computer software products to mass merchants in the united states

a discussion of her sales by product line follows fiscal year music sales grew to million from million for fiscal  due to increased sales of compact discs  increased market share with mass merchants and more hit albums in fiscal by artists such as celine dion  garth brooks  spice girls  chumbawumba and leann rimes 
cd sales for fiscal year were million or of her s music sales  compared to million or of her s music sales for fiscal year according to the recording industry association of america  music industry cd dollar sales reached of total music revenues for calendar versus for calendar video sales declined to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  substantially attributable to customers buying direct from the major video studios 
book sales decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  principally resulting from fewer hit titles 
personal computer software sales decreased to million this year from million last year  primarily the result of two major customers exiting the product line 
nce is responsible for the company s proprietary operations  which include music  video and personal computer software products 
nce had net sales of million for fiscal  compared to million last year  a decrease of 
this decrease was driven by a decrease in video sales which followed industry trends  as well as a slight decline in computer software product sales due to delayed releases of new titles 
nce sales to other divisions within the company were million for fiscal and million for fiscal international includes category management operations in canada  mexico  brazil and argentina 
international had net sales of million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal  an increase of 
the increase in international sales was principally from operations in brazil and argentina  where year over year net sales increased by million and million  respectively 
these increases were offset  to some extent  by the loss of two major customers in canada the bay  which exited the music and video businesses  and the canadian kmart stores which were acquired by zellers 
during the first quarter of fiscal  zellers retained the company to provide rackjobbing services for all of its stores 
sales in international were also impacted by pressure from mexican retailers to reduce store inventories which limited shipments and increased returns 
the growth of the international operating unit and expansion to additional foreign countries has introduced operating risks eg  currency fluctuation  political and economic instability that could have an effect on results of operations 
direct product costs as a percentage of revenues declined to in fiscal from in fiscal the improvement in direct product costs as a percentage of revenues was substantially attributable to her  which experienced a reduction in low margin  mega hit video sales and an increase in music sales 
music products have a cost to revenue relationship lower than her s overall relationship of direct product costs to revenues 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million of revenues for fiscal  compared to million of revenues for fiscal the decrease in sg a expenses was attributable to improvements in the her operating unit 
the lower her sg a expense level was driven by the impact of the various initiatives that have been implemented to improve operational efficiency 
the decrease in her sg a expenses was somewhat offset by increased sg a expenses within the nce and international operating units 
nce fiscal sg a expenses increased by million over the fiscal sg a expense level  primarily related to new product introductions 
sg a expenses in international increased by million over the fiscal expense level as a result of the increased product returns in mexico and the growth of the brazilian and argentine operations 
despite the increases in international and nce  consolidated sg a expenses declined million for fiscal as a result of continued cost reductions in her  as discussed above 
net interest expense for fiscal was million  compared to million for fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to higher interest rates 
income before income taxes and minority interest in fiscal was  compared to million in fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to the million provision for nonrecurring and repositioning related charges recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal improvement in income before income taxes within her was offset by deterioration in income before income taxes and minority interest within international 
the improvement in her was driven by the aforementioned reductions in both direct product costs as a percentage of revenues and sg a expenses 
the deterioration within international was primarily attributable to mexico  which experienced an million year over year decrease in income before taxes and minority interest 
the resultant loss in mexico was caused by the combination of lower customer shipments  increased product returns and higher sg a expenses  as discussed above 
decreases in income before income taxes and minority interest in brazil and argentina of million and million  respectively  and an increase in corporate costs to support international activities  also contributed to the overall operating loss in international 
mexican losses during the first three quarters of fiscal were mitigated to some extent by a sharing of the losses with the company s joint venture partner 
during the fourth quarter  handleman acquired the interest of its partner in mexico and  therefore  minority interest was not recorded 
the minority interest was income of million for fiscal and expense of million for fiscal accounts receivable were million at the end of fiscal  compared to million at the end of fiscal  a decrease of 
the lower receivable balance was attributable to the lower level of sales during the fourth quarter this year compared to the fourth quarter last year  as well as a concerted multi discipline  ongoing collection effort which reduced days sales outstanding in accounts receivable by seven days 
merchandise inventories were million as of may   compared to million as of may   a decrease of million 
a substantial decrease in her inventory levels  resulting from the company s inventory reduction program  was mostly offset by increases in nce and international inventory levels 
the decrease in net property and equipment for fiscal from fiscal was due to the disposal of video display fixtures  related to customers buying direct from the major studios  as well as the sale of certain company owned facilities resulting from the transition to the automated distribution center adc system 
debt  noncurrent was reduced by million from million as of may  to million as of may  this decrease was achieved despite spending approximately million in connection with the company s share repurchase program

net income for fiscal was million or 
per share  compared to a net loss of million or

fiscal consisted of weeks  whereas fiscal consisted of weeks 
management believes the inclusion of one additional week in fiscal did not have a material effect on results of operations for fiscal her net sales for fiscal were million  approximately equal to fiscal net sales of million 
following is a discussion of sales for each of her s four major product lines music sales for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal  mainly due to increased sales of compact discs 
compact disc cd sales for fiscal were million or of her s music sales  compared to million or of her s music sales for fiscal video sales for fiscal were million  a decline of from million for fiscal  substantially attributable to a million decline in sales of mega hit titles 
book sales increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  principally resulting from an increase in the number of departments shipped 
personal computer software sales decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  primarily the result of an million sales decline from a major customer which exited the product line during the third quarter of fiscal nce net sales were million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal  an increase of 
this increase was driven by sales growth ranging from million to million in each of nce s three primary operating units 
nce net sales for fiscal exclude million of sales from nce s entertainment zone subsidiary  which closed during fiscal nce sales to other divisions within the company were million in fiscal and million in fiscal international net sales for fiscal were million  compared to million for fiscal  an increase of 
approximately of the increase in international net sales was driven by the addition of new customers to the account base in mexico 
in addition  approximately of the increase in international net sales resulted from expansion of operations in brazil and argentina 
direct product costs as a percentage of revenues for fiscal was  compared to for fiscal the year over year improvement in direct product costs as a percentage of revenues resulted from a number of factors including an increase in the proportion of nce sales in the overall sales mix 
this positively impacted the overall percentage since sales of nce products carry lower product cost percentages than the overall direct product cost percentage 
a significant portion of the decrease in the direct product cost to revenue percentage as compared to last year resulted from lower product cost percentages at each operating unit 
the improvement within her was substantially the result of music sales becoming a larger proportion of the her sales mix and a reduction in sales of low margin mega hit video titles 
approximately of the percentage point decrease in the direct product cost percentage from for fiscal to for fiscal could be attributed to the increase in nce sales in the overall sales mix and the improved direct product cost percentage within her selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million of revenues for fiscal  compared to million of revenues for fiscal the decrease in sg a expenses as a percentage of revenues was attributable to improvements in the international and her operating units 
within the international operating unit  which accounted for approximately of the reduction in the sg a expenses to revenue percentage  the improvement principally resulted from the spreading of fixed costs over the higher sales level and the inclusion of costs in fiscal related to the start up of operations in brazil and argentina 
the lower sg a expenses to revenue percentage at her  which accounted for approximately of the overall improvement  was driven by the impact of the various initiatives implemented to improve operational efficiency  such as implementing best practices at the warehouse and distribution facilities 
these improvements were partially offset by higher sg a expenses related to proprietary product activities in the nce operating unit 
interest expense decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to lower borrowing levels 
income before income taxes and minority interest was million in fiscal  compared to a loss of million in fiscal fiscal included a million pre tax provision for nonrecurring and repositioning related charges 
the remainder of the million improvement in income before income taxes was due to the aforementioned improvements in sales and costs 
accounts receivable were million at the end of fiscal  compared to million at the end of fiscal  an increase of 
the increase in accounts receivable was partially the result of the higher level of sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal  in addition  the impact of customers immediately reducing payments for product returns also contributed to the increase in accounts receivable 
over of the year over year increase in accounts receivable can be attributed to these factors 
merchandise inventories were million as of may   compared to million as of april   a decrease of million or 
the decrease was substantially the result of the company s inventory reduction program and adc implementation 
the decrease in other current assets at may  compared to april  was primarily due to a decrease in income taxes receivable 
the decrease in property and equipment from fiscal to fiscal was due to the disposal of certain company owned facilities resulting from the transition to the adc distribution system 
the accounts payable balance at the end of fiscal was million  compared to million last year 
net inventory investment inventory less accounts payable was a negative million as of may   compared to a negative million as of april  liquidity and capital resources working capital at may  was million  compared to million at may   a decrease of million or 
the decrease in working capital primarily resulted from improved collections and a lower accounts receivable balance at may  the working capital ratio of to at may  remains unchanged from may  for fiscal  net cash provided from operating activities primarily resulted from non cash charges for depreciation  amortization and recoupment of license advances 
capital assets consist primarily of display fixtures  warehouse equipment and facilities 
the company also acquires or licenses video  music and software products which it markets 
purchases of these assets are expected to be funded primarily by cash flow from operations 
the company has an unsecured  five year   credit agreement with a consortium of banks  that expires in september the company also has  outstanding as of may  under a senior note agreement with a group of insurance companies 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for scheduled maturities of the credit agreement  senior notes and  of economic development corporation limited obligation revenue bonds 
in connection with the repositioning program discussed previously  the company amended its bank credit agreement to effect compliance with existing restrictions and covenants of the credit agreement 
the company is currently having discussions with the holders of the senior notes to acquire waivers or amendments which may be necessitated by recording  in the first quarter of fiscal  the charges contemplated by the repositioning program 
management believes that the required waivers or amendments will be obtained from the senior note holders 
in the event that the required waivers or amendments are not obtained  management believes that the amended credit agreement  supplemented by cash proceeds from the repositioning program  will provide sufficient amounts to repay the senior note holders and fund day to day operations and higher peak seasonal demands
