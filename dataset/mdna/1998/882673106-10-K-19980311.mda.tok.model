item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations selected consolidated financial information net income for the year ended december  was million  reflecting a net increase of million or a increase compared to net income of million for the year ended december  the earnings per share of for the year ended december  increased or compared to the earnings per share of for the year ended december  earnings performance for the year ended december  reflected gains in net interest income and an increase in noninterest income 
these positive factors were partially offset by an increase in provision for loan losses and noninterest expenses 
a more detailed description of the results of operations is included in the material that follows 
the number of shares outstanding  dividends per share declared and paid  and related earnings per share amounts have been restated to retroactively give effect for the three for two stock split declared and distributed by texas regional bancshares  inc during the third quarter of on may   texas regional bancshares  inc the corporation completed its secondary public offering of million shares of the corporation s class a voting common stock priced at per share 
on may   texas regional also completed the acquisition of first state bank trust co  mission  texas and the border bank  hidalgo  texas which transactions are called the mergers in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  through merger with texas state bank the bank  the principal operating subsidiary of texas regional bancshares  inc collectively  the company 
the purchase price of the mergers was financed with a combination of proceeds from the million share common equity offering and cash on the balance sheet of the company 
the mergers included the assumption of million in loans and the assumption of million in deposit liabilities 
the mergers were accounted for as a purchase  therefore  the results of operations of the two acquired banks are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of each respective acquisition 
accordingly  certain income statement and balance sheet comparisons may not be appropriate 
the company paid cash and used the purchase method of accounting for the mergers which has resulted in the creation of intangible assets 
these intangible assets are deducted from capital in the determination of regulatory capital 
thus  cash earnings represent the regulatory capital generated during the year and can be viewed as net income excluding intangible amortization  net of tax 
while the definition of cash earnings may vary by company  management of texas regional believe this definition is appropriate as it measures the per share growth of regulatory capital  which impacts the amount available for dividends and acquisitions 
the following table reconciles reported net income to net income excluding intangible assets amortization cash earnings cash earnings taxable equivalent basis dollars in thousands  except per share data reported net income    intangible amortization   income tax adjustment cash earnings    cash earnings per common share basic diluted cash earnings return on average assets cash earnings return on average shareholders equity taxable equivalent basis assuming a federal income tax rate 
analysis of results of operations net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest earned on assets and interest expense incurred for the funds supporting those assets 
earning assets consists of loans  investment securities and federal funds sold 
for analytical purposes  income from tax exempt assets  primarily securities issued by state and local governments or authorities  is adjusted by an increment which equates tax exempt income to interest from taxable assets 
earning assets are financed by consumer and commercial deposits and short term borrowings 
in addition to these interest bearing funds  assets also are supported by interest free funds  primarily demand deposits and shareholders equity 
variations in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities  and their relative sensitivity to interest rate movements  determine changes in net interest income 
taxable equivalent net interest income was million for the year ended december   an increase of million or compared to the year ended december   and taxable equivalent net interest income of million for the year ended december   increased million or compared to the year ended december  both net interest income and the yield on earning assets were reduced by interest foregone on nonaccrual and renegotiated loans 
if interest on those loans had been accrued at the original contractual rates  additional interest income would have approximated million   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the net yield on total interest earning assets  also referred to as net interest margin  represents net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
since a significant portion of the company s funding is derived from interest free sources  primarily demand deposits and shareholders equity  the effective rate paid for all funds is lower than the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities alone 
as the following table illustrates  the net interest margin of for the year ended december  decreased basis points compared to for the year ended december  while the net interest margin of for the year ended december  decreased basis points compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the interest margin for the year ended december  is reflective of the increase in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities of for the year ended december  increased basis points compared to for the year ended december  and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities of for the year ended december  increased basis points compared to for the year ended december  the increase in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities during was primarily attributable to the general increase in average short term interest rates and increased competition from local financial institutions 
the yield on interest earning assets of for the year ended december  increased basis points compared to for the year ended december  and the yield on interest earning assets of for the year ended december  increased basis points compared to for the year ended december  the mix of average interest earning assets for the year ended december  compared to year ended december  was changed by total average loans of million increasing million or  total average investment securities of million increasing million or and average federal funds sold of million decreasing million or 
the decrease in loan yield for reflects the increase in competition from local financial institutions 
the decrease in loan yield for reflects the general decrease in average interest rates in compared to the increase in investment securities yield for the years ended december  and resulted from lower yielding investment securities maturing and the reinvesting of the proceeds into higher yields 
the following table presents for the last three calendar years the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest earning assets and the resultant yields  reported on a tax equivalent basis  as well as the average interest bearing liabilities  expressed both in dollars and rates 
average balances are derived from average daily balances and the yields and costs are established by dividing income or expense by the average balance of the asset or liability

treasury  federal agency  state  county and municipal securities  mortgage backed  corporate debt and equity securities 
the bank classifies debt and equity securities into one of three categories held to maturity  trading or available for sale 
at each reporting date  the appropriateness of the classification is reassessed 
investments in debt securities are classified as held to maturity and measured at amortized cost in the consolidated balance sheet only if management has the positive intent and ability to hold those securities to maturity 
securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading and measured at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet with unrealized holding gains and losses included in earnings

loans the company manages its credit risk by establishing and implementing strategies and guidelines appropriate to the characteristics of borrowers  industries  geographic locations and risk products 
diversification of risk within each of these areas is a primary objective 
policies and procedures are developed to ensure that loan commitments conform to current strategies and guidelines 
management continues to refine the company s credit policies and procedures to address the risks in the current and prospective environment and to reflect management s current strategic focus 
the credit process is controlled with continuous credit review and analysis  and by review by internal and external auditors and regulatory authorities 
the company s loans are widely diversified by borrower and industry group 
the company has collateral management policies in place so that collateral lending of all types is approached on a basis consistent with safe and sound standards 
valuation analysis is utilized to take into consideration the potentially adverse economic conditions under which liquidation could occur 
collateral accepted against the commercial loan portfolio includes accounts receivable and inventory  marketable securities  equipment and agricultural products 
autos  deeds of trust  life insurance and marketable securities are accepted as collateral for the installment loan portfolio 
management of the company believes that the company has benefited from increased loan demand due to passage of the north american free trade agreement nafta and the strong population growth in the rio grande valley 
the effects of nafta and the continued devaluation of the mexican peso relative to the us dollar have increased cross border trade and industrial development including activity at twin manufacturing plants located on each side of the border referred to as maquiladoras which benefit the rio grande valley economy 
management believes the on going mexican financial problems will not have a material adverse effect on the company s growth and earnings prospects  in part because the company presently has a low percentage of loans secured by mexican assets or that otherwise rely on collateral located in mexico 
the extension of credits denominated in a currency other than that of the country in which a borrower is located are called cross border credits 
with the completion of the mergers  the company has acquired some dollar denominated cross border credits to individuals or companies that are residents of  or domiciled in mexico 
the company s total cross border credits at december  of million were less than of total loans

total loans of million for the year ended december  increased million or compared to the year ended december  levels of million and increased million or for the year ended december  compared to levels of million at december  the increase in total loans for the year ended december  reflects growth in all loan categories except commercial tax exempt loans and is representative in part to the vitality of the rio grande valley economy 
the increase in total loans for the year ended december  is primarily attributable to the mergers 
a substantial portion of the increase in loans classified as real estate commercial mortgage loans consists of loans secured by real estate and other assets to commercial customers

approvals for the extension or renewal of loans without reduction of principal for more than one twelve month period are generally avoided  unless the loans are fully secured and properly margined by cash or marketable securities  or are revolving lines subject to annual analysis and renewal 
nonperforming assets the bank has several procedures in place to assist in maintaining the overall quality of its loan portfolio 
the bank has established underwriting guidelines to be followed by its officers and monitors its delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends 
nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans  loans for which the interest rate has been renegotiated below originally contracted rates and real estate or other assets that have been acquired in partial or full satisfaction of loan obligations 
the company s policy generally is to place a loan on nonaccrual status when payment of principal or interest is contractually past due days  or earlier when concern exists as to the ultimate collection of principal and interest 
at the time a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  interest previously accrued but uncollected is reversed and charged against current income 
nonaccrual loans of at december  increased million or compared to million at december  and nonaccrual loans at december  of million increased million or compared to million at december  the increase in nonaccrual loans during are due to several diverse credits secured primarily by real estate 
the increase in nonaccrual loans during were primarily attributable to three cross border credits totaling million 
the cross border nonaccrual credits at december  of million reflect a decrease of  when compared to the million at december  the decrease in cross border nonaccrual credits is a result of loan collections 
loans which are contractually past due days or more  which are both well secured or guaranteed by financially responsible third parties and in the process of collection  generally are not placed on nonaccrual status 
the amount of such loans past due days or more for the years ended december   and that are not classified as nonaccrual totaled million  million and  respectively 
the decrease in accruing loans past due days or more at december  as compared to the year ended december  is partly attributable to loan collections 
nonperforming assets of million at december  increased million or compared to december  levels of million and increased million or compared to december  levels of million 
the increase in foreclosed assets during was primarily attributable to a higher foreclosure rate of loans with real estate collateral  net of write downs and liquidations 
management actively seeks buyers for all other real estate 
see noninterest expense above 
the ratio of nonperforming assets plus accruing loans days or more past due as a percent of total loans and foreclosed assets at december  increased to from at december  due primarily to the increase in foreclosed assets 
the company s classification of nonperforming loans includes those loans for which management believes collection is doubtful 
management is not aware of any specific borrower relationships that are not reported as nonperforming where management has serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms which would cause nonperforming assets to increase materially 
the company identifies loans to be reported as impaired when such loans are in nonaccrual status or are considered troubled debt restructurings due to the granting of a below market rate of interest or a partial forgiveness of indebtedness on an existing loan 
impairment of loans having recorded investments of million at december  and million at december  has been recognized in conformity with statement  as amended by statement the average recorded investment in impaired loans during and was million and million  respectively

an analysis of the components of nonperforming assets for the last five years is presented in the following table nonperforming assets december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans      renegotiated loans nonperforming loans      foreclosed assets     total nonperforming assets      accruing loans days or more past due   total nonperforming assets and accruing loans days or more past due      nonperforming loans as a of total loans nonperforming assets as a of total loans and foreclosed assets nonperforming assets as a of total assets nonperforming assets plus accruing loans days or more past due as a of total loans and foreclosed assets interest income that would have been recorded for the year ended december  on nonaccrual and renegotiated loans had such loans performed in accordance with their original contractual terms and been outstanding throughout the year ended december   or since origination  if held for only part of that year  was approximately million 
for the year ended december   the amount of interest income actually recorded on nonaccrual and renegotiated loans was approximately  management regularly reviews and monitors the loan portfolio to identify borrowers experiencing financial difficulties 
management believes that  at december   all such loans had been identified and included in the nonaccrual  renegotiated or days past due loan totals reflected in the table above 
management continues to emphasize maintaining a low level of nonperforming assets and returning nonperforming assets to an earning status 
allowance for loan losses management analyzes the loan portfolio to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the appropriate provision required to maintain an adequate allowance 
in assessing the adequacy of the allowance  management reviews the size  quality and risks of loans in the portfolio and considers factors such as specific known risks  past experience  the status and amount of nonperforming assets and economic conditions 
a specific percentage is allocated to total loans in good standing and additional amounts are added for individual loans considered to have specific loss potential 
loans identified as losses are charged off 
in addition  the loan review committee of the bank reviews the assessments of management in determining the adequacy of the bank s allowance for loan losses 
based on total allocations  the provision is recorded to maintain the allowance at a level deemed appropriate by management 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  there can be no assurance that future additions to the allowance will not be necessary 
the allowance for loan losses at year ended december  was million  which represents a net increase of  or as compared to million at december  management believes that the allowance for loan losses at december  adequately reflects the risks in the loan portfolio 
various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination

in december  the mexican government announced a devaluation of the mexican peso relative to the united states dollar  and the mexican peso has since continued to decline relative to the dollar 
the company does not anticipate any negative impact on foreign deposits due to these recent devaluations of the peso 
the increase in foreign deposits is primarily attributable to mexican deposits obtained with the mergers during the following table presents foreign deposits  primarily from mexican sources  as of december  and foreign deposits december  dollars in thousands demand deposits   interest bearing deposits savings   money market checking and savings   time deposits under    time deposits of  or more   total interest bearing deposits   total foreign deposits   percentage of total deposits weighted average rate on foreign deposits liquidity liquidity management assures that adequate funds are available to meet deposit withdrawals  loan demand and maturing liabilities 
insufficient liquidity can result in higher costs of obtaining funds  while excessive liquidity can lead to a decline in earnings due to the cost of foregoing alternative investments 
the ability to renew and acquire additional deposit liabilities is a major source of liquidity 
the company s principal sources of funds are primarily within the local markets of the bank and consist of deposits  interest and principal payments on loans and investment securities  sales of loans and investment securities and borrowings 
see previous discussion regarding the maturity dates for loans  investment securities and deposits 
asset liquidity is provided by cash and assets which are readily marketable  or which can be pledged  or which will mature in the near future 
these include cash  federal funds sold and us government backed securities 
at december   the company s liquidity ratio  defined as cash  us government backed securities and federal funds sold as a percentage of deposits  was compared to at december  and compared to at december  liability liquidity is provided by access to core funding sources  principally various customers interest bearing and noninterest bearing deposit accounts in the company s trade area 
the company does not have nor does it solicit brokered deposits 
federal funds purchased and short term borrowings are additional sources of liquidity 
these sources of liquidity are short term in nature and are used  as necessary  to fund asset growth and meet short term liquidity needs 
during  funds for million of investment purchases and million of net loan growth came from various sources  including a net increase in deposits of million  million in proceeds from sale of investment securities  million in proceeds from maturing investment securities and million of net income 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia requires that federal bank regulatory authorities take prompt corrective action with respect to any depository institution which does not meet specified minimum capital requirements 
the applicable regulations establish five capital levels which require or permit the federal reserve board and other regulatory authorities to take supervisory action 
the relevant classifications range from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized 
the classifications are generally determined by applicable ratios of the institution  including tier i capital to risk weighted assets  total capital to risk weighted assets and leverage ratios 
based on texas state bank s capital ratios as of december   texas state bank was classified as well capitalized under the applicable regulations 
as a result  the company does not believe that the prompt corrective action regulations have any material effect on the activities or operations of the company or texas state bank 
the corporation is dependent on dividend and interest income from the bank and the sale of stock for its liquidity 
applicable federal reserve board regulations provide that bank holding companies are permitted by regulatory authorities to pay cash dividends on their common or preferred stock if consolidated earnings and consolidated capital are within regulatory guidelines and the bank is classified as well capitalized for purposes of fdicia 
the principal sources of liquidity for the corporation during were interest income of  from the bank 
the funds received were used primarily to pay expenses 
the funds management policy of the company is to maintain a reasonably balanced position of rate sensitive assets and liabilities to avoid adverse changes in net interest income 
changes in net interest income occur when interest rates on loans and investments change in a different time period from that of changes in interest rates on liabilities  or when the mix and volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities change 
the interest rate sensitivity gap represents the dollar amount of difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities within a given time period gap 
a gap ratio is determined by dividing rate sensitive assets by rate sensitive liabilities 
a ratio of indicates a perfectly matched position  in which case the effect on net interest income due to interest rate movements would be zero 
rate sensitive liabilities maturing within one year exceeded rate sensitive assets with comparable maturities at december  by million 
management monitors the rate sensitivity gap on a regular basis and takes steps when appropriate to improve the sensitivity 
the cumulative rate sensitive gap to total assets at a period of twelve months or less was at december  the following table summarizes interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities by their repricing dates at december  interest rate sensitivity analysis december  over dollars in thousands months months months years years total loans       investment securities available for sale       held to maturity       federal funds sold   total interest earning assets       savings   money market checking and savings accounts   time deposits      federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements   total interest bearing liabilities      rate sensitivity gap       cumulative rate sensitivity gap      ratio of cumulative rate sensitivity gap to total assets ratio of cumulative rate sensitive interest earning assets to cumulative rate sensitive interest bearing liabilities rate sensitive interest earning assets less rate sensitive interest bearing liabilities 
gap analysis is the simplest representation of the company s interest rate sensitivity 
however  it cannot reveal the impact of factors such as administered rates eg  the prime lending rate  pricing strategies on consumer and business deposits  changes in balance sheet mix  or the effect of various options embedded in balance sheet instruments 
accordingly  the funds management committee conducts simulations of net interest income under a variety of market interest rate scenarios 
these simulations which consider forecasted balances sheet changes  and forecasted changes in interest rate spreads provide the committee with an estimate of earnings at risk for given changes in interest rates 
at december   based on these simulations  earnings at risk to an immediate basis points rise in market interest rates was estimated to be less than percent of projected after tax net income 
an immediate basis point rise in interest rates is hypothetical rate scenario  used to calibrate risk  and does not necessarily represent management s current view of future market developments 
all the measurements of risk described above are made based upon the company s business mix and interest rate exposures at the particular point in time 
the exposures change continuously as a result of the corporation s ongoing business and its risk management initiatives 
while management believes these measures provide a meaningful representation of the company s interest rate sensitivity  they do not necessarily take in account all business developments that have an effect on net income  such as changes in credit quality or the size and composition of the balance sheet 
the company does not currently engage in trading activities or use derivative instruments to control interest rate risk 
even though such activities may be permitted with the approval of the board of directors  the company does not intend to engage in such activities in the immediate future 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the company 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities 
effects of inflation financial institutions are impacted differently by inflation than are industrial companies 
while industrial and manufacturing companies generally have significant investments in inventories and fixed assets  financial institutions ordinarily do not have such investments 
as a result  financial institutions are generally in a better position than industrial companies to respond to inflationary trends by monitoring the spread between interest costs and interest income yields through adjustments of maturities and interest rates of assets and liabilities 
in addition  inflation tends to increase demand for loans from financial institutions as industrial companies attempt to maintain a constant level of goods in inventory and assets 
as consumers of goods and services  financial institutions are affected by inflation as prices increase  causing an increase in costs of salaries  employee benefits  occupancy expense and similar items 
capital resources shareholders equity of million for the year ended december  reflects a net increase of approximately million or compared to shareholders equity of million for the year ended december  this net increase was primarily attributable to the earnings for the risk based capital standards as established by the federal reserve board of governors apply to texas regional and texas state bank 
the numerator of the risk based capital ratio for bank holding companies includes tier i capital  consisting of common shareholders equity and qualifying cumulative and noncumulative perpetual preferred stock  and tier ii capital  consisting of other preferred stock  reserve for possible loan losses and certain subordinated and term debt securities 
goodwill is deducted from tier i capital 
at no time is tier ii capital allowed to exceed tier i capital in the calculation of total capital 
the denominator or asset portion of the risk based ratio aggregates generic classes of balance sheet and off balance sheet exposures  each weighted by one of four factors  ranging from to  based on the relative risk of the exposure class 
ratio targets are set for both tier i and total capital tier i plus tier ii capital 
the minimum level of tier i capital to total assets is and the minimum total capital ratio is 
the federal reserve board has guidelines for a leverage ratio that is designed as an additional evaluation of capital adequacy of banks and bank holding companies 
the leverage ratio is defined to be the company s tier i capital divided by its quarterly average total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets 
an insured depository institution is well capitalized for purposes of fdicia if its total capital ratio is equal to or greater than  tier i capital ratio is equal to or greater than  and leverage capital ratio is equal to or greater than 
the company s tier i capital ratio was approximately and as of december  and  respectively 
the company s total capital ratio was approximately and as of december  and  respectively 
the company s leverage capital ratio was and at december  and  respectively 
based on capital ratios  the company is within the definition of well capitalized for federal reserve purposes as of december  the following table presents the company s risk based capital calculation risk based capital december  dollars in thousands total shareholders equity before unrealized gains or losses on securities available for sale   less goodwill and other deductions   total tier i capital   total tier ii capital   total qualifying capital   risk adjusted assets including off balance sheet exposure   tier i capital ratio total capital ratio leverage capital ratio current accounting issues in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no
