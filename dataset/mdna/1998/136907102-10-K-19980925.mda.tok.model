variability of quarterly operating results 
the company s quarterly operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter  depending upon factors such as the timing of product sales  the timing of expenditures in anticipation of future product orders  the introduction and market acceptance of new products  effectiveness in managing manufacturing processes  changes in cost and availability of labor and product components  order cancellations  the budgetary cycles of its customers  the timing of regulatory approvals and the cost of operating the laserspa tm owned by the company s wholly owned subsidiary  candela skin care centers  inc 
the company s ability to accurately forecast future revenues and income for any period is necessarily limited  and any forward looking information provided from time to time by the company represents only management s then best current estimate of future results or trends  and actual results may differ materially from those contained in the company s estimates 
potential volatility of stock price 
there has been significant volatility in the market price of securities of companies in the medical device industry 
factors such as announcements of new products by the company or its competitors  quarterly fluctuations in the financial results of the company or its competitors  shortfalls in the company s actual financial results compared to results previously forecast by stock market analysts  conditions in the medical device industry and the financial markets and the economy generally could cause the market price of the company s securities to fluctuate substantially and may adversely affect the price of the company s securities 
risks associated with international operations 
a significant portion of the company s revenues are attributable to international operations and those revenues are likely to continue to represent a significant portion of the company s revenues in future periods 
the company s international business and financial performance may be adversely affected by a number of factors  including without limitations to fluctuations in exchange rates  tariffs and other trade barriers  adverse tax regulation  and adverse political and economic conditions 
adverse effects on the company s international operations may have materially adverse effects on the company s overall financial condition and operating results 
business strategic development 
while continuing to expand and diversify its core cosmetic and surgical laser equipment business  the company embarked on a new business strategy of opening combined spa and laser cosmetic skin care centers 
currently the company operates a combined spa skin care facility in boston  massachusetts  created by combining the company s skin care center previously located in framingham  massachusetts  with the spa in boston 
a combined spa skin care facility located in scottsdale  arizona  was closed in december while the company continues to operate the boston facility  it has made the decision to sell the assets of both the scottsdale and the boston facilities 
in march  the company negotiated with a california based aesthetic cosmetic services group for the sale of both facilities 
since these negotiations failed to consummate the sale of the facilities to this group  the company made the decision to place the sale sublease of the facilities with a national real estate broker 
the company anticipates that the sale of both facilities will be finalized within the next fiscal year  but no assurances can be made that the sale sublease will be successful 
additionally  the company entered into a joint venture with egyptian investors to open a new laser cosmetic center in cairo  egypt 
however  since results of operations were marginal  the joint venture was terminated 
the surgical skin care treatments performed in the boston skin care center are administered by board certified physicians under contract with the company s wholly owned subsidiary  cscc 
while the target market for the company s core laser equipment tends to be medical practice groups and other health care providers  its target market for its spa and skin care centers are individuals who are typically reached through entirely different marketing efforts 
the cost structures  new client accretion methods and other demands associated with the company s spa and skin care center are largely untested  and the company could incur significant losses in relation thereto 
governmental regulation 
medical devices are subject to governmental approval before they can be utilized for clinical studies or sold commercially 
in addition  the company s activities in connection with its cscc business may subject the company to additional regulation under state and federal laws 
the process for obtaining the necessary approvals and compliance with applicable regulations can be costly and time consuming 
many foreign countries in which the company markets or may market its products have similar regulatory bodies and restrictions 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to obtain any such government approvals or successfully comply with any such regulations in a timely and cost effective manner  if at all  and failure to do so may have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
risks associated with product liability 
the administration of medical and cosmetic treatments using laser products is subject to various risks of physical injury to the patient which may result in product liability or other claims against the company 
the costs and resources involved in defending or settling any such claims  or the payment of any award in connection therewith  may adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results 
the company maintains product liability insurance  but there is no assurance that its policy will provide sufficient coverage for any claim or claims that may arise  or that the company will be able to maintain such insurance coverage on favorable economic terms 
rapid technological change  competition 
the medical laser industry is subject to rapid and substantial technological development and product innovations 
to be successful  the company must be responsive to new developments in laser technology and new applications of existing technology  and the company s financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected by the failure of new or existing products to compete favorably in response to such technological developments 
in addition  the company competes against numerous other companies offering products similar to those of the company and or alternative products and technologies  some of which have greater financial  marketing and technical resources than the company 
there can be no assurance the company will be able to compete successfully these companies 
in addition  the company s cscc operations face a wide range of competitors including hair salons  health spas  massage therapists  aestheticians  health and fitness clubs  personal trainers  dermatologists  plastic surgeons  cosmetic laser centers and cosmetic retailers 
the company also believes its cscc operations will face competition from laser manufacturing companies that have  or may develop  plans to open facilities based on concepts similar to the candela laserspa tm concept 
such competition could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
reliance on attracting and retaining key employees 
the company s success will depend in large part on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific  technical  managerial  sales and marketing  management and other personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense and any decline in the company s ability to attract and retain such personnel may have adverse effects on its financial condition and operating results
