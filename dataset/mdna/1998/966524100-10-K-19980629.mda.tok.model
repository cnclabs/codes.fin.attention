the revenues generated from these subsidiaries primarily consist of tuition and fees paid by students 
the majority of students rely on funds received from title iv programs to pay for a substantial portion of their tuition 
accordingly  a majority of whitman s revenues are indirectly derived from title iv programs 
historically  whitman s revenues have increased primarily as a result of the expansion of program offerings and the opening or acquisition of campuses 
at uds  the expansion of program offerings generated an increase in its revenues from million in fiscal to million in fiscal at colorado tech  the expansion of program offerings  opening of a campus  and the acquisition of huron university generated an increase in revenues from million in fiscal to million in fiscal on december   colorado tech acquired the south dakota operations and certain assets at two campuses of huron university 
the sioux falls campus of huron university was subsequently converted to a colorado technical university campus 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
for the year ended march  and the three months ended march   the two campuses of huron university generated net of revenues of million and million  respectively  and sustained operating losses of million and  respectively 
instructional and educational support consists primarily of costs related to the educational activity of whitman s schools 
instructional and educational support includes faculty compensation  administrative salaries for departments that provide services directly to the students  occupancy costs  costs of books sold  and depreciation and amortization of equipment costs and leasehold improvements

selling and promotional expenses increased by million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  selling and promotional expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in selling and promotional expenses was primarily due to increased marketing and advertising costs at the associate degree division for the programs offered at uds and to an increase in selling and promotional costs at the university degree division for the new denver colorado tech campus and the acquired campuses of huron university in huron and sioux falls  south dakota 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal these decreases were due primarily to a decrease in bad debt expense at the associate degree division due to improved cash collections 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues was due to whitman s ability to increase revenues as a result of an increase in student enrollment at a greater rate than the rate of increase in administrative operating costs necessary to support the increase in enrollment 
interest expense increased by  due to the increase in the average outstanding debt balance necessary to fund capital expenditures 
whitman periodically performs an analysis of the realizability of its deferred tax assets based on management s assessment of current and expected operating results

year ended march  compared to year ended march  net revenues increased by million or to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  the increase was primarily due to an increase in average student enrollment 
average student enrollment increased overall with the university degree division experiencing a increase and the associate degree division experiencing an increase

this increase was primarily due to the introduction of additional business programs  the opening of a colorado tech campus in october and the acquisition of huron university in december the increase in student enrollment in the associate degree division resulted in increased net revenues of million or 
the increased enrollment was primarily in the cardiovascular and medical assisting programs offered by uds which were introduced during fiscal the increased revenues derived from increased student enrollment at uds were partially offset by decreased revenues at sanford brown 
this decline in revenues resulted from a decrease in the average monthly earning rate per student that occurred as a result of the lengthening of the curriculum  a decrease in the frequency of class starts and the negative effect of the change in the billing rates for general education courses and core courses 
instructional and educational support increased by million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  instructional and educational support expenses increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal these increases were primarily due to investments made during fiscal for the purpose of enhancing the quality of the education being provided to students  improving student satisfaction  and enhancing the management and staff at the schools in order to strengthen the procedures and controls over regulatory compliance 
these investments primarily related to the upgrade of equipment and the relocation of facilities  the addition of faculty  staff and management at the schools and the implementation of new education programs 
such investments resulted in an increase in salaries  occupancy costs  and depreciation expense 
management believes that the benefits provided to the students from these investments will support higher placement rates and higher retention rates which should contribute to increased future enrollments 
in addition  instruction and educational support expenses increased in fiscal due to the related costs incurred to support the opening of a colorado tech campus and the acquisition of huron university 
selling and promotional expenses increased by million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  selling and promotional expenses increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the increase in selling and promotional expenses was primarily due to increased marketing and advertising costs at the associate degree division for the programs offered at uds and to an increase in selling and promotional costs at the university degree division for the new colorado tech campus and huron university

such collection delays have been corrected 
interest expense decreased  due to a reduction in the average outstanding debt balance and a reduction in interest rates

whitman periodically performs an analysis of the realizability of its deferred tax assets based on management s assessment of current and expected operating results 
as of march   whitman determined that a million valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets was necessary  which resulted in the recognition of a deferred income tax benefit of  in fiscal whitman reported a net loss of million and a net loss of  for the years ended march  and  respectively 
the increase in the net loss for fiscal was primarily due to the investments made for the addition of personnel  the upgrade of equipment and facilities  and the opening and acquisition of new campuses 
seasonality whitman experiences seasonality in its quarterly results of operations as a result of changes in the level of student enrollment 
new enrollment in whitman s schools tends to be higher in the third and fourth fiscal quarters because these quarters cover periods traditionally associated with the beginning of school semesters 
costs are generally not significantly affected by the seasonal factors on a quarterly basis 
accordingly  quarterly variations in net revenues will result in fluctuations in income from operations on a quarterly basis 
year issue whitman is currently working to resolve the potential impact of the year on the processing of date sensitive information by whitman s computerized information systems 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
whitman s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in miscalculations or system failures 
based on a recent assessment  whitman currently believes that with the modifications made to existing software and the conversions made to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems to its information systems 
in addition  formal communications with all significant suppliers have been initiated to determine the extent to which related interfaces with company systems are vulnerable if these third parties fail to remediate theirown year issues 
whitman expects to substantially complete and test the year issues by the early part of fiscal based on preliminary information  costs of addressing potential problems are not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on whitman s financial position  results of operations or cash flows in future periods 
there can be no assurance  however  that modifications to information systems and conversion of third party systems to remediate year issues will be made on a timely basis and that they will not adversely affect whitman s systems 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents at march   and were million  million and million  respectively 
whitman s working capital totalled million at march   compared to million at march  and million at march  in accordance with department of education regulations  whitman maintained  and  in restricted cash at march  and  respectively  as funds to be available for student refunds 
whitman was not required to maintain such restricted funds at march  net cash of  was provided by operating activities in fiscal  an increase in cash provided of million from fiscal and a decrease of million from fiscal the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was primarily due to an increase in net income of million from fiscal in fiscal  whitman generated million in cash from operating activities due primarily to cash provided from operations of sanford brown of million 
net cash of million was used for investing activities in fiscal  a decrease of  from fiscal and an increase of million from fiscal the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in fiscal from fiscal was due to an increase in capital expenditures due primarily to the purchase of computer equipment for the schools and leasehold improvements incurred for the expansion and opening of school facilities 
whitman estimates that the capital expenditures expected to be incurred during fiscal will approximate million 
these anticipated capital expenditures primarily relate to the costs associated with the relocation and upgrade of campus facilities and the acquisition and upgrade of equipment for the schools 
funds required to finance such capital expenditures are expected to be obtained from additional capital lease obligations and from funds generated from operations 
net cash of million was provided by financing activities in fiscal  an decrease of million from fiscal and an increase of million from fiscal the decrease in fiscal from fiscal and the increase in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to a private placement in fiscal of  shares of whitman s common stock to an unaffiliated institutional investor for million 
whitman had a revolving credit facility of million expiring in may and a revolver note maturing in april in the amount of million 
at march   whitman had million outstanding under these facilities 
the amounts borrowed under these facilities in fiscal were primarily used for operations and capital expenditures 
in may  the revolver note was increased from million to million 
in addition  whitman increased its term loan availability by million in june in order to finance capital expenditures at huron university 
on may   whitman repaid the million revolving credit facility by drawing down on the million revolver note 
whitman s primary source of operating liquidity is the cash received from payments of tuition and fees 
most students attending whitman s schools receive some form of financial aid under title iv programs 
uds  sanford brown and colorado tech receive approximately  and of their funding  respectively  from the title iv programs 
disbursements under each program are subject to disallowance and repayment by the schools 
whitman believes that with its working capital  its cash flow from operations  its increased working capital facilities and its expected increased financings under capital lease obligations to fund capital expenditures  it will have adequate resources to meet its anticipated operating requirements for the foreseeable future except that  due to the seasonality of whitman s revenues  whitman may need to borrow additional funds in the second fiscal quarter 
if such funds not exceed necessary  whitman anticipates the additional borrowings will approximate  while whitman believes that it will be able to secure such additional financing  there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so
