the company disclaims  any intent or obligation to update these forward looking statements 
overview since the company s inception in  the company has been primarily involved in the research  development  manufacturing and marketing of rapid diagnostic tests 
the company began commercial sales of the triage panel for drugs of abuse triage doa panel in february and currently markets the product worldwide primarily through distributors supported by a direct sales force 
the company is engaged in research and development of additional rapid diagnostic products in the microbiology  cardiology and therapeutic drug monitoring fields 
all of the company s sales to date have been due to sales of the triage doa panel product line 
the triage doa panel is currently marketed pursuant to exclusive distribution agreements in the us hospital market segment by fisher which accounted for of product sales in and in certain countries in europe  latin america  the middle east  asia and africa by merck kgaa merck 
since the launch of the triage doa panel in fiscal  the company has experienced continued revenue growth from its triage doa panel product line 
the company believes that the growth in sales of triage doa panel products is slowing as the available us market becomes saturated and competitive pressures become more and more prominent in a maturing market 
the company anticipates that its results of operations may fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors  including whether and when new products are successfully developed and introduced by the company  market acceptance of current or new products  regulatory delays  product recalls  manufacturing delays  shipment problems  seasonal customer demand  the timing of significant orders  changes in reimbursement policies  competitive pressures on average selling prices  changes in the mix of products sold and patent conflicts 
operating results would also be adversely affected by a downturn in the market for the company s current and future products  if any  order cancellations or order rescheduling 
the company currently manufactures and ships product shortly after receipt of orders and anticipates that it will do so in the future 
accordingly  the company has not developed a significant backlog and does not anticipate it will develop a material backlog in the future 
because the company is continuing to increase its operating expenses for personnel and new product development  the company s operating results would be adversely affected if its sales did not correspondingly increase or if its product development efforts are unsuccessful or are subject to delays 
the company s limited operating history makes accurate prediction of future operating results difficult or impossible 
although the company has experienced growth in recent years  there can be no assurance that  in the future  the company will sustain revenue growth or remain profitable on a quarterly or annual basis or that its growth will be consistent with predictions made by securities analysts 
recent developments initial public offering in february  the company completed its initial public offering of  shares of common stock including an exercised underwriters over allotment option for  shares of common stock at a price to the public of per share  providing the company with net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately million and offering expenses of approximately  additionally  all outstanding shares of preferred stock were converted into  shares of common stock and an outstanding million convertible debenture and related accrued interest was converted into  shares of common stock upon the completion of the initial public offering

used in conjunction with the triage meter  the triage cardiac panel is a rapid diagnostic product that quantitatively measures  in a single test device  the level of ck mb  troponin i and myoglobin from a whole blood sample 
in march  the company received final clearance from the fda to market the triage c 
difficile panel  a new rapid test designed to identify clostridium difficile  an opportunistic pathogen of the intestinal tract that may thrive as a result of broad spectrum antibiotic treatment 
prior to the launch of the triage cardiac system or the triage c 
difficile panel  the company will need to complete an internal validation of the manufacturing processes of each of the new products  in compliance with fda standards 
the company also successfully completed feasibility studies for the triage neoral system under its antibody license agreement with novartis 
as a result of this milestone achievement  novartis invested  in january  an additional  in biosite in exchange for a convertible debenture 
the convertible debenture was immediately converted into  shares of common stock of the company based on the ipo of per share 
additionally  the company and novartis entered into an agreement to expand the scope of the collaborative development of the triage neoral system 
the expansion of the collaboration may result in payments to biosite upon attainment of certain milestones

the long term distribution arrangement with fisher would expand their role to include the distribution of the triage cardiac system and triage c 
difficile panel and certain of the potential new products in the us medical market 
as a result of a decision by merck to refocus away from certain aspects of the human diagnostic business  the company terminated the development and distribution agreement for the triage cardiac system with merck in december upon termination  the company paid a million cash payment and forgave approximately million owed to the company by merck related to the development of the triage cardiac system 
additionally  the company terminated its agreement with merck  effective december  regarding international distribution rights for the triage doa panel product line 
the company is evaluating product distribution alternatives for the international markets  including  among other things  alliances with other distribution partners and the establishment of a direct sales force in certain european countries 
the company anticipates that it may  if appropriate  enter into additional distribution agreements with respect to its products currently under development and products that it develops in the future  if any of such products receive the requisite regulatory clearance or approvals 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to enter into these or other distribution agreements on acceptable terms  if at all 
if the company elects to distribute products directly  there can be no assurance that the company s direct sales  marketing and distribution efforts would be successful
