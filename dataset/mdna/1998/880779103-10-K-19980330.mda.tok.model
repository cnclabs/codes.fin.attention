extraordinary items the company recorded a charge of million in to recognize a loss on the early extinguishment of debt in connection with its debt refinancing in may liquidity and capital resources the company s businesses are working capital intensive and require funding for purchases of production and replacement parts inventories  capital expenditures for repair  replacement and upgrading of existing facilities as well as financing of receivables from customers and dealers 
the company has significant debt service requirements 
debt reduction and an improved capital structure are major focal points for the company 
in this regard  the company regularly reviews its alternatives to improve its capital structure and to reduce debt through debt refinancings  issuances of equity  asset sales  including the sale of business units  or any combination thereof 
as part of its strategy the company has consummated several transactions over the past months which have strengthened its capital structure and significantly reduced its cost of funds 
on november   the company completed the clark sale for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately million 
upon closing  the company initially used the proceeds to pay down its then existing domestic credit facility 
then  on december   the company called all of its issued and outstanding series a preferred stock for redemption on january  the series a redemption date

a portion of the proceeds from the stock offering were initially used to reduce borrowings under the company s then existing domestic revolving credit facility 
on september   the company used a portion of the proceeds from the stock offering to redeem million of the senior secured notes 
the total funds paid at the redemption were million million principal  million redemption premium and million accrued interest 
as a result of the redemption of a portion of the senior secured notes  the annual interest payments on the senior secured notes decreased from million to million  a savings of million per year 
in december  two additional transactions were completed that further improved the company s capital structure 
on december   the company eliminated all of the issued and outstanding shares of series a redeemable exchangeable preferred stock of its subsidiary  terex cranes  inc the subsidiary preferred stock  by merging terex cranes  inc with the company and exchanging the subsidiary preferred stock originally issued in connection with the ppm acquisition into  shares of common stock of the company 
on december   all of the company s issued and outstanding shares of series b cumulative redeemable convertible preferred stock  which was accreting initially at a rate of per annum  and was to increase to per annum at the end of  were converted by the holder thereof into  shares of common stock of the company 
on march   the company consummated the new bank credit facility  the refinancing of substantially all of its domestic and foreign revolving credit facilities  and the purchase or defeasance of all of the company s outstanding senior secured notes 
the new bank credit facility consists of the new revolving credit facility aggregating up to million and the term loan facilities providing for loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to approximately million 
borrowings under the term loan facilities were used by the company to i finance the purchase of the million of its then outstanding senior secured notes and pay the premium and accrued interest in connection therewith and ii repay in full the outstanding indebtedness and related fees and expenses under certain of the company s then existing credit facilities 
in connection with these actions  the company will incur an extraordinary loss of million in the first quarter of borrowings under the term loan facilities will also be used to fund a portion of the aggregate consideration for the acquisition of o k mining 
the new revolving credit facility  which is currently undrawn  will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes 
on march   the company entered into a purchase agreement to issue and sell million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due the new senior subordinated notes 
the new senior subordinated notes are being issued and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the securities act of  as amended  and the closing is expected to occur on march  the new senior subordinated notes are unsecured and repayment is guaranteed on an unsecured basis by certain of the company s domestic subsidiaries 
the proceeds of the issuance and sale of the new senior subordinated notes will be used to fund a portion of the aggregate consideration for the acquisition of o k mining and for general corporate purposes 
net cash of million was used by operating activities during million was provided by operating results plus depreciation and amortization  and approximately million was invested in working capital during the period to support the increase in business activity at terex lifting and tel 
the remaining effect on cash from operations for the period was due to the costs of financing 
net cash used in investing activities was million during  primarily related to the purchase of the simon access companies and baraga products  inc net cash provided by financing activities was million during cash was provided by the net proceeds from the public offering of common stock and additional borrowings primarily related to the purchase of the simon access companies 
cash was used for the redemption of the series a preferred stock and the redemption of a portion of the senior secured notes 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december  factors affecting future liquidity the company s debt service obligations for include quarterly interest and principal payments on the term loan facilities and variable periodic payments on the new revolving credit facility and will include semi annual interest payments due on the senior subordinated notes issued in connection with the o k mining acquisition 
management believes that with cash generated from operations  together with borrowings under the new revolving credit facility which is currently undrawn  the company has adequate liquidity to meet the company s operating and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future 
the new bank credit facility places certain limits on the company s ability  among other things  to incur indebtedness and liens  pay dividends and make other payments  consummate mergers and asset acquisitions and sales  enter into related party transactions and make capital expenditures and investments 
the new bank credit facility also contains certain financial and operating covenants  including a maximum leverage ratio  a minimum interest coverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
foreign currencies and interest rate risk the company s products are sold in over countries around the world and  accordingly  revenues of the company are generated in foreign currencies  while the costs associated with those revenues are only partly incurred in the same currencies 
the major foreign currencies  among others  in which the company does business are the pound sterling and the french franc 
following consummation of the o k mining acquisition  the company will also conduct significant business in deutsche marks 
the company may  from time to time  hedge specifically identified committed cash flows in foreign currencies using forward currency sale or purchase contracts 
such foreign currency contracts have not historically been material in amount 
because certain of the company s obligations  including indebtedness under the new bank credit facility  will bear interest at floating rates  an increase in interest rates could adversely affect  among other things  the ability of the company to meet its debt service obligations 
the company has entered into interest protection arrangements with respect to approximately million of the principal amount of its indebtedness under the new bank credit facility fixing interest at various rates between and 
contingencies and uncertainties the internal revenue service the irs is currently examining the company s federal tax returns for the years through in december  the company received an examination report from the irs proposing a substantial tax deficiency 
the examination report raised a variety of issues  including the company s substantiation for certain deductions taken during this period  the company s utilization of certain net operating loss carryovers nols and the availability of such nols to offset future taxable income 
the company filed an administrative appeal to the examination report in april in june  the company was advised that the matter was being referred back to the audit division of the irs 
the irs is currently reviewing information provided by the company 
the ultimate outcome of this matter is subject to the resolution of significant legal and factual issues 
given the stage of the audit  and the number and complexity of the legal and administrative proceedings involved in reaching a resolution of this matter  it is unlikely that the ultimate outcome  if unfavorable to the company  will be determined for at least several years 
if the irs were to prevail on all the issues raised  the amount of the tax assessment would be approximately million plus penalties of approximately million and interest through december  of approximately million 
the penalties asserted by the irs are calculated as of the amount of the tax assessed for fiscal year and of the tax assessed for each of fiscal years and interest on the amount of tax assessed and penalties is currently accruing at a rate of per annum 
the applicable annual rate of interest has historically varied from to 
if the company were required to pay a significant portion of the assessment with related interest and penalties  such payment might exceed the company s resources 
in such event  the viability of the company would be placed in jeopardy  and it is uncertain that the company could  through financing or otherwise  obtain the funds required to pay such assessment  interest  and applicable penalties 
management believes  however  that the company will be able to provide adequate documentation for a substantial portion of the deductions questioned by the irs and that there is substantial support for the company s past and future utilization of the nols 
based upon consultation with its tax advisors  management believes that the company s position will prevail on the most significant issues 
accordingly  management believes that the outcome of the examination will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations  but may result in some reduction in the amount of the nols available to the company 
no additional accruals have been made for any amounts which might be due as a result of this matter because the possible loss ranges from zero to million plus interest and penalties  and the ultimate outcome cannot be determined or estimated at this time 
no reserves are being expensed to cover the potential liability 
as of december   the company had federal nols of approximately million 
the company would be subject to an annual limitation described below on its ability to utilize its nols to offset future taxable income if the company undergoes an ownership change an ownership change within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code of  as amended section 
generally  an ownership change is deemed to occur if the aggregate cumulative increase in the percentage ownership of the capital stock of the company which generally includes for this purpose  but is not limited to  the common stock and certain options and warrants by persons owning or more of such capital stock and certain public groups within the meaning of section is more than percentage points in any three year testing period 
in the event of an ownership change  the company s utilization of its nols would be limited to an annual amount without extending the applicable year carryforward period for nols equal to the product of the fair market value of the company immediately before such ownership change as determined pursuant to section  which may provide for certain reductions in value multiplied by the long term tax exempt rate  which is an interest indexed rate that is published monthly by the irs and which is approximately as of the date of this annual report 
nols arising after the date that any ownership change occurs will be unaffected by such ownership change 
it is impossible for the company to ensure that an ownership change will not occur in the future  in part because the company has no ability to restrict the acquisition or disposition of the company s capital stock by persons whose ownership could cause an ownership change 
in addition  the company may in the future take certain actions which  alone or coupled with other events  could give rise to an ownership change  if in the exercise of the business judgment of the company such actions which may include future issuances of equity securities are necessary or desirable 
if an ownership change were to occur  the nol annual limitation under section could substantially reduce the company s future after tax earnings and cash flow 
in march  the securities and exchange commission the commission initiated a private investigation  which included the company and certain of its present and former officers and affiliates  to determine whether violations of certain aspects of the federal securities laws had occurred 
to date  the inquiry of the commission has primarily focused on accounting treatment and reporting matters relating to various transactions which took place in the late s and early s 
the company is cooperating with the commission in its investigation 
the company has recently been advised by the staff of the commission that it has been authorized by the commission to institute an administrative proceeding against the company and certain of its present and former officers and affiliates 
based on information currently available to the company  it is the company s understanding that if a proceeding were to be brought  the staff intends to seek an order to cease and desist violations of the federal securities laws without monetary penalties based on claims relating to accounting treatment and reporting matters with respect to the company s financial statements for the years ended december  and  as well as the company s proxy statement covering the fiscal year 
it is not possible at this time to determine the outcome of the commission s investigation 
during  in connection with the commission s investigation  the company incurred million of legal fees and expenses on behalf of the company  directors and executives of the company  and kcs 
in general  under the company s by laws  the company is obligated to indemnify officers and directors for all liabilities arising in the course of their duties on behalf of the company 
to date  no officer or director has had legal representation separate from the company s legal representation  and no allocation of the legal fees for such representation has been made 
the company is subject to a number of contingencies and uncertainties including product liability claims  self insurance obligations  tax examinations and guarantees 
many of the exposures are unasserted or proceedings are at a preliminary stage  and it is not presently possible to estimate the amount or timing of any cost to the company 
however  management does not believe that these contingencies and uncertainties will  in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on the company 
when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and possible to make reasonable estimates of the company s liability with respect to such matters  a provision is recorded for the amount of such estimate or for the minimum amount of a range of estimates when it is not possible to estimate the amount within the range that is most likely to occur 
the company generates hazardous and non hazardous wastes in the normal course of its manufacturing operations 
as a result  the company is subject to a wide range of federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations  including cercla  that i govern activities or operations that may have adverse environmental effects  such as discharges to air and water  as well as handling and disposal practices for hazardous and non hazardous wastes  and ii impose liability for the costs of cleaning up  and certain damages resulting from  sites of past spills  disposals or other releases of hazardous substances 
compliance with such laws and regulations has  and will  require expenditures by the company on a continuing basis 
the company does not expect that these expenditures will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations
