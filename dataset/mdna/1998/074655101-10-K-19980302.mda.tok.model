also  contributing to a downward trend in sales was a change in this year s recruiting strategy 
in early  the company offered a wellness promotion that was designed to create a unique type of consultant for the health and beauty line 
this strategy  combined with other sales and recruiting promotions run throughout the year  produced results below expectations and did not have the projected impact needed to drive domestic recruiting and sales performance 
the company rolled out nationwide in its new compensation plan that was successfully tested in several markets in while the compensation plan improvements are still relatively new to the consultants  it has been well received and is considered a positive  more lucrative change 
because of this  the company expects it will be integral to achieving favorable results in the future as part of the overall recruiting program

an estimated  of the november  balance was related to these credit programs

due to the continuation of these credit programs  the company chose to increase its allowance for bad debt to offset any related collection risk 
this amount increased by  in the company s inventory levels decreased  during compared to during  inventory levels related to core products were increased to expedite orders and to improve customer service
