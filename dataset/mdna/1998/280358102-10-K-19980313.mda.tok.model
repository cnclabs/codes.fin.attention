the company generally pays its temporary employees weekly for their services  while receiving payments from customers to days from the date of the invoice 
as new offices are established or acquired  or as existing offices are expanded  the company has increasing requirements for cash resources to fund growing operations 
in may  the company expanded its credit facility with mercantile from million to million  which included a million revolving line of credit and a million acquisition facility 
in march  the company and mercantile amended and restated the credit facility to increase the company s borrowing availability from million to million the credit facility 
the credit facility matures on april  and interest on any borrowings is computed at the company s option of either libor or mercantile s prime rate and incrementally adjusted based on the company s operating leverage ratios 
as a result of the recent amendment to the credit facility  there is no distinction between a revolving credit line for operations and an acquisition facility  such that borrowings  whether for operations or for acquisitions  may be made up to million 
for the three month period ended march   the company paid a quarterly commitment fee equal to of the total credit facility million at that time 
subsequent to march   the quarterly commitment fee was determined by multiplying the unused portion of the credit facility by a percentage which varies from to based on the company s operating leverage ratio

the remaining net proceeds of approximately million were used to fund the cash consideration portion of several of the acquisitions completed subsequent to the secondary offering 
until the payment of the cash was made  the company had invested the remaining net proceeds from the secondary offering in investment grade  interest bearing securities 
the company is obligated under various acquisition agreements to pay additional consideration  which will be paid in a combination of cash and common stock  to certain former stockholders of acquired companies 
see note to the company s audited financial statements 
management believes that neither the total amount of these contingent payments nor the specific combination of cash and common stock consideration can be currently determined 
management believes that its cash flows from operations  the credit facility and its ability to issue equity or debt securities will provide sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy these obligations 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the net cash provided by and used in operating activities for the periods presented was primarily attributable to net income adjusted for non cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization and changes in operating assets and liabilities

cash used in investing activities in was primarily related to the acquisitions of the other founding companies 
cash used in investing activities in was primarily related to the acquisition of caldwell for approximately million

cash provided by financing activities in was primarily attributable to the proceeds from debt issued in conjunction with the acquisition of caldwell partially offset by debt payments and dividends paid to stockholders 
as a result of the foregoing  combined cash and cash equivalents decreased million in and increased million and  in and  respectively 
management believes that its cash flows from operations  borrowings available under the credit facility  offerings of debt or equity securities and the use of common stock as partial consideration for acquisitions will provide sufficient liquidity or acquisition currency to execute the company s acquisition and internal growth plans through the expiration of the credit facility 
should the company accelerate its acquisition program  the company may need to seek additional financing through the public or private sale of equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance that the company could secure such financing if and when it is needed or on terms the company deems acceptable 
management plans to periodically reassess the adequacy of the company s liquidity position  taking into consideration current and anticipated operating cash flow  anticipated capital expenditures  acquisition plans and offerings of debt or equity securities  in order to ensure the credit facility is adequate to meet the company s needs on a short term and long term basis

all of these software systems including all of the systems from which a selection will be made for the professional it and specialty niche divisions have the ability to process transactions with dates for the year and beyond at no incremental cost and  accordingly  year costs are not expected to have any material impact on the company s future financial condition or results of operations 
seasonality the timing of certain holidays  weather conditions and seasonal vacation patterns may cause the company s results of operations to fluctuate slightly 
the company generally expects to realize higher revenues  operating income and net income during the second and third quarters and relatively lower revenues  operating income and net income during the first and fourth quarters 
inflation the effects of inflation on the company s operation were not significant during the periods presented in the financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  reporting comprehensive income and sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
both sfas and sfas are effective for calendar year financial statements 
sfas establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income in the financial statements 
comprehensive income is the total of net income and all other non owner changes in equity 
management does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a significant effect on the company s financial statement presentation 
sfas requires that companies disclose segment data consistent with the way management makes decisions about allocating resources to segments and measuring their performance 
among the information to be disclosed  sfas requires an entity to report a measure of segment profit or loss  certain specific revenue and expense items and segment assets 
sfas also requires a reconciliation of total segment revenues  total segment profit or loss and total segment assets to the corresponding amounts shown in the company s consolidated financial statements 
adoption of sfas is expected to result in additional disclosures  but will not have an effect on the company s financial position or results of operations
