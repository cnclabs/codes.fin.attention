the underground mining business of british jeffrey diamond was a manufacturer of components such as shearers and related equipment used in the longwall method of underground mining 
komdresco  a general partnership in which the company held a percent interest  acted as a distributor and licensed manufacturer of dresser  haulpak  galion and komatsu mining and construction equipment and materials handling products in south africa and certain neighboring territories 
the jeffrey underground mining equipment operation  which was primarily engaged in the production of underground continuous mining machines  haulage systems and related equipment used primarily in underground coal mines  was sold on october  sales of jeffrey equipment were generally made directly to users through the company s sales engineers and support personnel 
profile and type of customers most customers of the company are medium to large corporations or businesses  and medium to large distribution companies which serve them 
major customer groupings include large multi plant integrated steel companies  medium single plant integrated steel companies  mini mill electric furnace steel companies  aluminum companies  cement and lime producers  flat glass and container glass producers  chemical plants  petroleum refineries  power plants  waste incineration companies  quarries  automotive companies  aircraft production companies  shredding and recycling companies and copper and other mineral refining companies 
customers are located in most geographical areas  including north and south america  africa  asia  the far east  europe and australia 
many customers are served by more than one operation of the company 
international sales and exports international sales and direct exports from the u

high purity magnesium hydroxide  a critical material to harbison walker  is obtained through an exclusive arrangement with dow chemical that has been in existence for years 
the current contract expires december  this contract has been extended many times and the company anticipates further extensions 
the company believes that other raw materials it requires are readily available from multiple sources and that the loss of an individual supplier would not have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to procure necessary raw materials

during the s  these industries experienced significant consolidation and retrenchment 
the company now competes with several large national and international companies in each segment

they are believed to be utilized at productive capacities generally ranging from percent to percent  with the exception of ameri forge where capacity utilization is often significantly higher  and are capable of supporting a higher level of market demand 
in certain cases  an increase in productive capacity of the facilities can be realized through the addition of an extra shift of hourly laborers

the decrease in revenues in is primarily the result of the divestiture of the company non core businesses primarily the marion power shovel company  which had generated revenues of million in offset by higher revenues of million in refractory products  million in industrial tool  and million in specialty equipment 
revenues increased in all segments  with the exception of minerals where lower demand and the stronger us dollar contributed to a reduction of million in from see further discussion in the industry segment analysis below 
consolidated cost of sales was million in  or percent lower than the million reported in  due to the previously mentioned divestitures of non core businesses
