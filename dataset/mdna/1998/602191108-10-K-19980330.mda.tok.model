the company s military rugged business segment provides specialized computers and related peripheral equipment to the united states and foreign military defense departments 
equipment in this segment takes two primary forms 
the first of these is fully militarized products  usually designed especially for a particular mission area with demanding environmental and quality requirements 
the second of these is rugged products  usually based on a commercial baseline product  but adapted by the company to meet environmental and quality specifications that exceed the requirements for commercial products 
this entire segment has been impacted in recent years by reduced government spending and defense appropriations 
the militarized product area has been especially subject to defense budget cuts 
the military continues to reduce funding for the development and limited production quantities of highly customized systems and products 
the long design cycle for these programs creates an intangible cost in the form of rapid technological obsolescence 
some military programs that would have sought militarized equipment some years ago have modified the requirements to reflect a need for rugged or commercial products 
this trend has tended to benefit sales of the company s rugged product line 
even in the rugged product area  however  defense cuts have taken a toll 
competition in this area has become more keen in recent years  as many government contractors pursue fewer military programs

during and  the company reduced the valuation allowance by  and  respectively

effects of inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s results of operations 
year compliance as is well known  many computer and digital storage systems express dates using only the last two digits of the year and will thus require modification or replacement to accommodate the year and beyond in order to avoid malfunction and resulting widespread business disruption 
the company has identified most significant internal applications that will require modification to ensure year compliance 
internal and external resources are being used to make the required modifications and test year compliance 
the company plans on completing the modification and testing of all significant applications by december  the company is initiating formal communications with its significant suppliers and customers to determine the extent  if any  to which the company s interface systems would be impacted by those third parties failure to remediate their own year compliance issue 
the cost to the company of these year compliance activities has not been  and is not anticipated to be  material to its financial position or results of operation in any given year 
these costs and the date on which the company plans to complete the year modification and testing processes are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ from those plans 
given the complexity of this issue  it is not possible for any organization to guarantee that all year problems will be resolved 
however  the company believes that it will achieve an acceptable level of readiness and will provide resources that will address any subsequent failures or issues that might arise
