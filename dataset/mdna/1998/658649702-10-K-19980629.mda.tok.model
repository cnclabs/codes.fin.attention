item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company is engaged in the exploration  development and production of natural gas and oil  primarily in conjunction with the drilling programs it sponsors and manages 
the company derives its revenues from its own oil and gas production and turnkey drilling  well operations  gas gathering  transportation and gas marketing services performed under contract with the drilling programs 
since inception  the company has raised approximately  from the sale of partnership interests  which has resulted in the formation of partnerships 
several factors may affect the amount of the company s revenues with respect to the activities of the drilling programs 
the amount of funds raised by each drilling program determines the number of wells for which the company receives drilling revenues 
the company continually monitors the cost incurred in drilling  completion and production operations and reviews its turnkey contract prices for each drilling program in order to reduce the risk of unprofitable drilling operations to the company and the economic considerations of the investors in the drilling programs 
the turnkey drilling contract price between the drilling programs and the company may vary among drilling programs depending on competition and other cost factors and the returns sought by investors in the drilling programs 
the company s capital availability  as well as revenue and profit considerations  may result in the company changing its percentage interest ownership in future drilling programs 
the company s growth depends on a number of factors  including its continued ability to raise drilling program funds from non industry investors to increase the number of wells from which the company will receive production  contract drilling and service related revenues and the company s ability to maintain adequate liquidity to provide its contributions to new drilling programs and to acquire additional proved undeveloped or proved producing properties 
the company s growth is also dependent on several external factors  including the price at which gas  and to a lesser extent oil  can be found and sold 
the company s proved developed natural gas reserves increased to bcf for fiscal from bcf for fiscal while proved developed oil reserves increased to  barrels from  barrels  respectively 
the increase in proved developed natural gas reserves resulted from the purchase of partnership interests from certain of the company s drilling program investors and working interests in certain wells from unrelated parties coupled with upward revisions of the gas reserves of the company s existing wells 
the proved gas reserves developed and undeveloped increased to bcf for fiscal from bcf for fiscal the increase in proved gas reserves was due to the increases mentioned previously for the proved developed reserves coupled with the upward revision to the proved undeveloped reserves for drilling locations that were proved through the company s recent drilling programs 
proved oil reserves developed and undeveloped increased to  barrels at march  from  barrels at march  due primarily to the upward revision of  barrels for fiscal the company recognizes as proved undeveloped reserves the potential oil and gas which can reasonably be expected to be recovered from drillable locations which the company owned or had rights to at fiscal year end which are offsetting locations to wells that have indicated commercial production in the objective formation and which the company fully expects to drill in the very near future 
changes in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows are set forth in note of the company s financial statements 
the above mentioned additions and sales of natural gas  coupled with the development costs associated with undeveloped acreage  create timing differences which are reflected in the other category of the standardized measure 
of the company s total proved reserves  approximately are proved developed and approximately are proved undeveloped based upon equivalent unit mcfs 
proved undeveloped acreage requires considerable capital expenditures to develop 
management of the company believes that a significant percentage of the proved undeveloped reserves should be recovered in future years  although no assurance of such recovery can be given 
the following table is a review of the results of operations of the company for the fiscal years ended march   and all items in the table are calculated as a percentage of total revenues

comparison of fiscal to fiscal revenues oil and gas production revenues decreased  to  for fiscal compared to  for the prior corresponding period 
the decrease in oil and gas production revenues was a result of a decrease in oil revenues of approximately  due to a decrease in the oil production and in the average price received for oil by the company between comparable periods 
for fiscal the company received an average price of per barrel of oil and per mcf of natural gas compared to an average price of per barrel of oil and per mcf of natural gas received during fiscal drilling revenues for the period decreased by  for fiscal compared to fiscal due to the decrease in the number of wells recognized in revenue 
the company recognized revenues for fiscal on wells as compared to wells for fiscal the decrease in the number of wells recognized in drilling revenues was primarily due to the higher number of carryover wells at the end of fiscal compared to fiscal the company has two wells in work in progress at fiscal year ended compared to five at fiscal year ended revenues generated from well operating  transportation and other decreased  for fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in unaffiliated third party gas sales 
the unaffiliated third party gas sales fluctuate from year to year based upon the availability of these types of transactions 
revenue from administrative and agency fees  which are based on a percentage of the total investor capital raised in all of the drilling programs  increased by  for fiscal compared to fiscal due to the formation of the drilling programs in fiscal the administrative fees derived from the fiscal drilling programs were charged a rate equal to of total capital raised compared to the prior years programs which are charged an annual fee equal to of total capital raised 
expenses oil and gas production expense increased  for fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to additional costs incurred with relocation of certain production facilities in the gulf coast area and costs associated with reworking wells in pennsylvania 
drilling costs for fiscal compared to fiscal decreased  due to the decreased number of wells completed between comparable periods 
the profit margin on drilling revenue decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decrease in the drilling profit margin between comparable periods was due to actual completion costs over the estimated accruals from wells recognized in drilling income coupled with increased general and administrative costs allocated to drilling activities 
net drilling income decreased approximately  between fiscal year ends due to the fewer number of wells drilled and completed 
oil and gas operations expense decreased  for fiscal as compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily due to reduced natural gas purchases associated with unaffiliated third party gas sales 
interest expense decreased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to the reduction of the borrowings under the company s credit facility and other debt by utilizing funds received from the sale of common stock 
at march    was outstanding under the company s credit facility  as compared to  at march  net income was  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the decrease reflects the decreased drilling activity and production revenues between comparable periods 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal revenues oil and gas production revenues increased  to  for fiscal compared to  for the prior corresponding period 
oil and gas production was relatively constant between years 
the increase in production revenues was primarily attributable to an average increase in gas prices of and an increase of oil prices of 
for fiscal the company received an average price of per barrel of oil and per mcf of natural gas compared to an average price of per barrel of oil and per mcf of natural gas received during fiscal drilling revenues for the period decreased by  for fiscal compared to fiscal due to the decrease in the number of wells recognized in revenue 
the company recognized revenues for fiscal on wells as compared to wells for fiscal the decrease in the number of wells recognized in drilling revenues was due to the decrease of  in the amount of funds raised in the fiscal drilling programs of  as compared to  for the fiscal drilling programs 
management of the company believes that this reduction was caused by the uncertainties arising from the purchase of north coast common stock by lomak  a stockholder of the company 
the company had five wells in work in progress at year ended compared to at year ended revenues generated from well operating  transportation and other increased  for fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in unaffiliated third party gas sales 
the unaffiliated third party gas sales fluctuate from year to year based upon the availability of these types of transactions and company resources available 
the increase was also due to increases in well operating revenue and compression revenue from the company s five compressor stations 
expenses drilling costs for fiscal compared to fiscal decreased  due to the decreased number of wells completed between comparable periods 
the gross profit margin was for both fiscal periods presented 
net drilling income decreased approximately  between fiscal year ends due to the fewer number of wells drilled and completed 
oil and gas operations expense increased  for fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to the increase in gas purchases related to unaffiliated third party gas sales as discussed above 
general and administrative expenses decreased  for fiscal compared with fiscal despite incurring  in expenses associated with the litigation with lomak and the company s offer to convert its preferred stock 
the lomak litigation was settled on november  this decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to costs savings derived from reduced salaries and employee benefits when the company reduced the size of its staff 
in addition  the staff reductions resulted in certain changes in job responsibility resulting in additional general and administrative costs being allocated to production expense and oil and gas operations 
depreciation  depletion  amortization  impairment and other decreased  for fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily due to the implementation of the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of during fiscal which resulted in an impairment of  for fiscal without a corresponding impairment for in addition  the adoption of sfas resulted in a decreased basis of existing properties being depleted for future periods 
interest expense increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal this increase was primarily due to the company s additional borrowings on its reducing revolving credit facility 
at march    was outstanding under the company s credit facility compared to  at march  operating income for the fiscal year ended increased  to  compared to an operating loss of  for the fiscal year ended net income increased  for fiscal to  as compared to a net loss of  for fiscal these increases in operating income and net income are primarily due to the decrease in general and administrative expenses  depreciation  depletion  amortization  impairment and other as well as increases in oil and gas production and well operating  transportation and other 
inflation and changes in prices while the costs of operations have been and will continue to be affected by inflation  oil and gas prices have fluctuated during recent years and generally have not followed the same pattern as inflation 
with today s global economy  especially in the area of oil and natural gas  management believes that other forces of the economy and world events  such as opec  the weather  economic factors  and the effects of supply of natural gas in the united states and regionally have a more immediate effect on current pricing than inflation 
the company received an average price of and per barrel for fiscal and  respectively  and and per mcf for natural gas for fiscal and  respectively 
on average  appalachian natural gas prices decreased mcf from fiscal year to fiscal year however  the company experienced a mcf increase for its natural gas during this period 
the increase the company received can be attributed to a change in marketing strategy including aggressively targeting small to medium sized commercial end users  balancing the remainder of the company s gas prices between spot appalachian based prices and nymex based prices 
this strategy allows the company the greatest opportunity to exceed the average regional prices  while minimizing the effects of a negative fluctuation 
the industry wide weakness of natural gas prices can be attributed to the effects of el nino 
most of the country experienced a relatively mild winter  which lessened demand for natural gas 
although it is anticipated that there will be a decline in gas prices during the summer months  the demand for gas by storage facilities  coupled with the anticipated nationwide hot summer  may keep gas prices above last summer s 
other variables potentially effecting gas prices are increased competition from canadian gas  effects of gas storage and possibly federal energy regulatory commission ferc order the ferc order may have contributed to the lower spot market prices by mandating an unbundling of pipeline service and allowing open access to a variety of geographical markets 
management cannot predict what long term effects ferc order will have on either spot market prices or longer term gas contracts 
currently  the company sells natural gas under both fixed price contracts and on the spot market 
the spot market price the company receives for gas production is related to several variables  including the weather and the effects of gas storage 
the company anticipates that spot market prices will continue to fluctuate in response to various factors  primarily weather and market conditions 
in an effort to position itself to take advantage of future increases in demand for natural gas  the company continues to construct new pipeline systems in the appalachian basin and to contract with other pipeline systems in the region to transport natural gas production from company wells 
liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital was  at march  compared to  at march  the increase of  in working capital from march  reflects the company s improved cash position from the sale of million shares of common stock on september  as of march   the company had  outstanding under its credit facility 
north coast s current ratio was to at march  and to at march  the following table summarizes the company s financial position at march  and amounts in thousands amount amount working capital property and equipment   other total   long term debt   deferred income taxes stockholders equity   total   capital resources and requirements the oil and gas exploration and development activities of north coast historically have been financed through the drilling programs  through internally generated funds  and from bank financing 
the following table summarizes the company s statements of cash flows for the years ended march   and amounts in thousands dollars dollars dollars net cash provided by operating activities    net cash used for investing activities    net cash provided by financing activities   increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents all items in the previous table are calculated as a percentage of total cash sources 
total cash sources include the following items  if positive cash flow from operations before working capital changes  changes in working capital  net cash provided by investing activities and net cash provided by financing activities  plus any decrease in cash and cash equivalents 
as the above table indicates  the company s cash flow provided by operating activities remained relatively constant at  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal net cash used for investing activities increased from  of cash sources for fiscal to  of cash sources for fiscal the increase of only  reflects the corporate building purchased during fiscal during fiscal the company purchased additional interests in certain of its older drilling programs  purchased interests and operations in wells  and continued to purchase tangible equipment to fulfill its obligations to the partnerships it sponsors 
net cash provided by financing activities increased by  from fiscal to fiscal this increase reflects the sale of  of common stock  reduced dividends paid on the preferred stock  the repayment of loans to lomak petroleum  inc and the reduction of borrowings under the credit facility 
on february   the company entered an agreement credit agreement with ing us capital corporation to replace the  revolving credit facility credit facility with its previous lender 
the credit agreement provides for a borrowing base which is determined semiannually by the lender based upon the company s financial position  oil and gas reserves  as well as outstanding letters of credit  at march   as defined 
the credit agreement requires payment of an agent fee for credit agreement on amounts available and commitment fee on amounts not borrowed up to the available line 
at march   the company s borrowing base was  subject to reduction for the outstanding letters of credit 
available borrowings under the facility at march  were  and may subsequently change based upon the semiannual reserve study and borrowing base determination see note to the company s march  financial statements 
the credit facility provides that the payment of dividends with respect to the common stock of the company is prohibited 
as of march   the company had  outstanding under the credit facility  and was in compliance with its loan covenants 
amounts borrowed under the credit facility bear interest at the prime rate of the lending bank plus or libor plus 
the revolving line of credit is reviewed semi annually and extended by an amendment to the current facility or converted to a term loan on july  the amounts borrowed under its reducing revolving line of credit are secured by the company s receivables  inventory  equipment and a first mortgage on certain of the company s interests in oil and gas wells and reserves 
the mortgage notes are secured by certain land and buildings 
in addition  at march   the company had approximately  outstanding under a mortgage note payable 
the mortgage note bears interest at the rate of and requires the company to make monthly payments of approximately  through july the company purchased a building for its headquarters and entered a mortgage note on may  for  over a year term with an interest rate of to be renegotiated every five years 
the amount outstanding under the mortgage note at march  was  on september  the company sold  shares of its common stock for million to nuon international bv  a limited liability company organized under the laws of the netherlands nuon  pursuant to the terms of a stock purchase agreement agreement by and between the company and nuon dated august  the company also issued  warrants representing the right of the holder to purchase one share of common stock for per share in connection with the sale of common stock to nuon 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  including the development of a plan of complementary business  nuon may purchase an additional  shares of common stock by each of september  and september  the company is also obligated to issue  warrants on each occasion nuon purchases an additional  shares 
the additional warrants represent the right to purchase one share of common stock for per share 
a portion of the proceeds from the sale of common stock was utilized to repay existing subordinated indebtedness in the amount of  plus interest of  owed to lomak with the remaining proceeds used for working capital and to reduce the amount outstanding under the company s credit facility 
subsequent to march   the company acquired certain assets and assumed certain obligations of kelt ohio  inc  headquartered in cambridge  ohio 
the acquisition was made pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement dated april  as amended may  the purchase price for the acquired assets was approximately million 
the acquired assets include approximately natural gas and oil wells and kelt s brine disposal facilities  drilling and service rigs  natural gas compressors and gas gathering systems  and a large inventory of oilfield service equipment and supplies 
the company funded the acquisition using cash and an increase in its existing line of credit 
approximately million of the total purchase price was financed under a recently expanded credit facility with the remaining amount paid in cash 
an amended credit facility dated may  expands the company s borrowing base to million 
the credit agreement calls for payments to reduce the credit facility to million by july  if nuon international bv  the company s largest stockholder  does not exercise its option to purchase an additional million in common stock by september  the balance availability under the credit facility is million as of june  management of the company believes that general economic conditions and various sources of available capital  including current available borrowings under the credit facility and the expected funds to be received from nuon  will be sufficient to fund the company s operations and meet debt service requirements through fiscal in the event that available borrowings under the credit facility are not sufficient  nuon does not exercise its option to purchase additional common stock or additional financing cannot be obtained  the company would need to conserve cash resources 
in order to accomplish this objective  the company believes that it would be necessary to take various actions  including reducing the amount of capital raised in future drilling programs  the introduction of additional cost cutting measures and the possible sale of certain assets 
management of the company believes that measures of this type may have a material adverse effect on the company 
year the company has developed an action plan and identified the resources needed to convert the majority of its computer systems and software applications to achieve a year date conversion with no effect on customers or disruption to business operations 
implementation of the plan has begun and the company anticipates completion of testing or replacement of systems by the end of fiscal the company estimates that the cost to complete these efforts  which primarily includes the purchase of software and hardware upgrades under normal maintenance agreements with third party vendors  will approximate  and will be expended primarily in fiscal in addition  the company has discussed with its vendors and customers the need to be compliant 
although the company has no reason to believe that its vendors and customers will not be compliant by the year  the company is unable to determine the extent to which year issues will effect its vendors and customers  and the company continues to discuss with its vendors and customers the need for implementing procedures to address this issue 
accounting standards in february  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information which may require the company to report certain information about operating segments including product  services and geographical areas 
sfas no 
is required to be adopted for financial statements with fiscal years beginning after december  the company has not determined the impact  if any  of this standard
