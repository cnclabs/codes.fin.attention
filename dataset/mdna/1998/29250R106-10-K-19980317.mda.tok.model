item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the partnership experienced a record year during as net income  pipeline system deliveries and barrel miles all reached record levels 
these operational milestones were reached primarily as a result of additional pipeline capacity and increased crude oil production in western canada 
deliveries to the midwest markets served by the partnership increased over primarily due to the successful completion of the partnership s system expansion program i sep i during late the exceptional performance of the partnership during prompted the board of directors of the general partner to increase the quarterly cash distribution on july  to per unit per unit on an annualized basis from per unit 
this increase  the third since the partnership s inception  is primarily the result of earnings growth from capacity expansions and the removal of uncertainty surrounding the partnership s tariff rates that existed prior to an october settlement agreement 
the partnership is continuing its efforts to further expand the pipeline system 
significant progress was made on the system expansion program ii sep ii which primarily involves the construction of a new pipeline from superior  wisconsin to the chicago  illinois area 
when complete  sep ii will provide an additional  barrels per day of delivery capacity on the partnership s pipeline from superior to chicago 
during the past year  construction of the new pipeline  pump stations  and other system modification was begun 
in addition to sep ii  during the partnership announced a further staged expansion of the pipeline system to commence in which will provide the capability to transport a further  barrels per day of heavy crude oil by late after allowing for anticipated light crude oil production declines  total system deliveries are anticipated to increase  barrels per day 
results of operations the partnership experienced record operational performance during as deliveries averaged  barrels per day  up from the  barrels per day averaged during this growth in lakehead system deliveries translated into a increase from last year in system utilization measured in barrel miles  reflecting a higher proportion of shorter haul deliveries to the significant midwest and eastern canadian markets served by the partnership 
deliveries during increased  and barrel miles were relatively unchanged  compared with results 
over the three year period  increased deliveries resulted from greater crude oil production in western canada and increased pipeline capacity from the partnership s expansion programs 
net income for was million per unit compared with million per unit for and million per unit for net income for and was impacted by rate refunds and related interest recorded in response to various tariff rate regulatory developments 
even though the partnership had been recording a provision for a potential rate refund since  additional provisions were required in  with respect to federal energy regulatory commission ferc opinion no 
 and in  with respect to a settlement agreement the settlement agreement between the partnership and representatives of certain of the partnership s customers 
in october  the ferc approved the settlement agreement 
the settlement agreement provided for a tariff rate reduction of approximately and total rate refunds and interest of million through the effective date of october   with interest accruing thereafter on the unpaid balance 
the settlement agreement concluded a protracted dispute between the partnership and its customers concerning the level of tariff rates 
to facilitate comparison of year to year financial results  set forth below are the recalculated operating results of the partnership for the indicated periods 
the retroactive impacts of the settlement agreement have been removed from and reported results 
results for were not impacted by retroactive aspects of the settlement agreement  therefore  no adjustments to net income are necessary 
recalculated operating results year ended december  dollars in millions  except per unit amounts operating revenue operating expenses interest and other income interest expense minority interest net income net income per unit net income for was million higher than recalculated net income in a combination of higher operating revenue and lower interest expense  partially offset by higher operating expense  led to the increase in net income 
per unit amounts decreased slightly due to increased incentive income allocations to the general partner primarily as a result of higher distribution levels  and an increase in the weighted average common units outstanding as a result of the october class a common unit offering 
net income per unit was calculated using million common units during due to the issuance of million class a common units during october  the weighted average number of common units outstanding will increase from million common units in to million common units in excluding any additional common units that may be issued 
recalculated net income for was million  or per unit  greater than recalculated net income for primarily due to increased revenues and lower operating costs resulting from cost control activities of the general partner 
operating revenue for was million greater than recalculated operating revenue for primarily due to increased deliveries and the transportation of a greater proportion of heavy crude oil up to  barrels per day 
operating revenue was also favorably impacted by the full year impact of a july tariff rate increase of  and an additional on july   as allowed under the ferc s indexing methodology 
recalculated operating revenue for and is computed at the tariff rates implied in the settlement agreement 
operating revenue for was million higher than primarily due to a greater proportion of heavy crude oil deliveries up to  barrels per day and the mid year tariff rate increase 
the tariff rate for heavier crude oil is greater than that for lighter crude oils primarily due to its higher viscosity which requires more power to pump 
the partnership s current tariff rate for medium and heavy crude oil deliveries to the chicago area is approximately and higher  respectively  than that for lighter crude oils 
total operating expenses were million greater than recalculated operating expenses primarily due to higher power costs million associated with a heavier crude oil mix  operational considerations  and increased deliveries 
depreciation expense for increased million primarily due to growth in property  plant and equipment  somewhat offset by the impact of revised depreciation rates that became effective on july  the depreciation rates were revised to better represent the expected service life of the pipeline system 
other operating expenses increased million primarily due to higher property taxes 
total recalculated operating expenses were million less than in primarily due to lower power costs million and oil losses million 
efficiencies gained from the partnership s ongoing power cost management initiative  partially offset by the transportation of greater amounts of heavy crude oil  led to the decrease in power costs in oil losses are impacted by operational considerations  including changing customer delivery requirements  and the volatility of crude oil prices  resulting in variances in the level of oil losses from year to year 
depreciation expense for increased only slightly over due to the impact of new depreciation rates  effective july  interest expense for decreased million from recalculated interest expense 
this decrease was primarily due to lower balances and interest rates with respect to rate refunds payable  and increased capitalized interest attributable to greater construction work in process balances during these changes were partially offset by additional interest on greater average borrowings in under the partnership s credit facility 
recalculated interest expense for was million greater than in primarily due to the impact of additional borrowings under the partnership s credit facility to finance enhancement capital expenditures including sep i 
liquidity and capital resources at december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totalled million  down million since december   as cash required for distributions  capital expenditures and other business needs slightly exceeded cash generated from operating activities and the equity offering 
of this million  million per unit was set aside for the cash distribution paid on february   with the remaining million available for capital expenditures and other business needs 
cash generated from operating activities in increased million  primarily due to higher net income  partially offset by the reduction in liability for rate refunds 
cash generated from operating activities in decreased million from primarily due to the repayment of rate refunds and related interest  partially offset by higher net income 
timing differences in the collection of accounts receivable and payment of accrued obligations led to the year to year changes in working capital requirements 
in response to the october settlement agreement  the partnership made rate refunds of million in and million in with the remaining balance being repaid through a reduction of tariff rates 
this reduction will continue until all refunds have been made 
based on the million remaining balance at december   and projected pipeline system deliveries  the refund credit is expected to remain effective until sometime during the second half of in  the partnership made capital expenditures of million  of which million was for sep ii and million was for other projects 
with million incurred in  the remaining million of the million total cost of sep ii is expected to be incurred in in addition to sep ii  the partnership anticipates spending approximately million for pipeline system enhancements and million for core maintenance activities in thereafter  ongoing capital expenditures are expected to average approximately million on an annual basis approximately for enhancement and for core maintenance of the pipeline system 
core maintenance activities  such as the replacement of equipment that is completing its useful life and preventive maintenance programs  are expected to be undertaken to enable the partnership s pipeline system to continue to operate at its maximum operating capacity 
enhancements to the pipeline system  such as renewal and replacement of pipe  are expected to extend the life of the lakehead system and permit the partnership to respond to developing industry and government standards and the changing service expectations of its customers 
in addition  the partnership anticipates it may incur other capital expenditures to significantly expand the pipeline system 
in particular  the partnership anticipates expending approximately million and million on the terrace project expansion program during and respectively 
see future prospects lakehead system expansion projects 
in  the partnership made capital expenditures of million  of which million was for sep i 
of the remaining capital expenditures in  million compared with million in was spent for core maintenance capital expenditures and million compared with million in for other enhancements including million for sep ii 
in october  the partnership issued an additional  class a common units 
net proceeds from the offering  including the general partner s contribution  were million 
this offering increased the number of class a common units outstanding to  proceeds from this offering are being used to finance sep ii 
for additional information regarding the equity offering and partnership organization  see note to the partnership s consolidated financial statements 
at december   the partnership had outstanding million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage notes bearing interest at the rate of per annum  payable semi annually 
the notes are due and payable in ten equal annual installments beginning in the year during  the partnership did not further borrow against its million revolving credit facility 
total borrowings under the facility of million were outstanding at december  subject to complying with certain financial covenants  the partnership expects to have the ability to borrow an additional million under this facility 
in the partnership borrowed million under its revolving credit facility primarily to finance sep i 
for additional details relating to the partnership s debt  see note to the partnership s consolidated financial statements 
distributions paid to partners for increased million to million per unit compared to this increase was primarily attributable to the per unit distribution increase declared july   an additional  class a common units issued october   and increased incentive distributions paid to the general partner as a result of the increase in cash distributions per unit 
the partnership distributes quarterly all of its available cash  which is generally defined to mean  with respect to any calendar quarter  the sum of all of the cash receipts of the partnership plus net reductions to reserves less all of its cash disbursements and net additions to reserves 
these reserves are retained to provide for the proper conduct of the partnership s business  to stabilize distributions of cash to the class a and class b common unitholders and the general partner and as necessary to comply with the terms of any agreement or obligation of the partnership 
distributions paid to partners for increased million to million per unit compared to the per unit quarterly distribution increase first paid in november accounted for this increase 
on february   the partnership paid a per unit distribution related to the fourth quarter of the general partner believes that the partnership will continue to have adequate liquidity to fund future recurring operating  investing and financing activities 
the partnership intends to fund the remaining portion of sep ii  and ongoing capital expenditures with the proceeds from future equity and debt offerings  bank borrowings  cash generated from operating activities  and existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
cash distributions are expected to be funded with internally generated cash 
the partnership s ability to make future equity and debt offerings will depend on prevailing market conditions and interest rates and the then existing financial condition of the partnership 
future prospects income and cash flows are sensitive to oil industry supply and demand in both canada and the united states  as well as the regulatory environment 
as the partnership s pipeline system is operationally integrated with the interprovincial pipe line inc system ipl or ipl system in western canada  the partnership s revenues are dependent upon the utilization of the ipl system by producers of western canadian crude oil 
ipl and the general partner believe demand for their pipeline systems will continue in light of industry s increasing production forecasts for western canadian crude oil 
see item business and properties 
the lakehead and ipl systems the system serve as a strategic link between the western canadian oil fields and the markets of the midwest us and eastern canada and currently operates at or near capacity 
in response to the continuing trend of increasing supply of crude oil from western canada and the growth of demand in the markets of the midwest us  the partnership plans not only to maintain the service capability of the existing lakehead system but also to expand its capacity where appropriate 
this is consistent with the partnership s principal business objective which is to increase cash generated from its operations and the distribution of available cash 
this strategy has enabled the partnership to increase quarterly cash distributions to common unitholders from per unit in to per unit currently 
lakehead system expansion projects key current and future expansion projects of the partnership are summarized below sep ii this expansion  which began in  is expected to provide an additional  barrels per day of delivery capacity on the lakehead system from superior to chicago 
current constraints on the capacity of the ipl system in western canada  however  will limit incremental volumes reaching the lakehead system to approximately  barrels per day 
these capacity constraints are expected to be alleviated following the completion of the terrace expansion project  see terrace project 
the sep ii project  which is expected to cost approximately million  was undertaken in response to apportionment of the existing capacity on the system among suppliers of western canadian crude oil and natural gas liquids ngls 
sep ii is being undertaken in conjunction with a cdn 
million capacity expansion of the ipl system by ipl 
the general partner is using its best efforts to complete sep ii by december  since sep ii will not enter service until late in  the project will not significantly impact net income during the year 
however  sep ii is anticipated to have a favorable impact on net income and cash flow of the partnership after terrace project in early  the partnership  in conjunction with ipl  announced a preliminary outline of a four stage expansion program to increase western canadian crude oil pipeline capacity 
initially  this project was proposed to be completed in stages over the period through however  in late  in response to customer requests  the partnership in conjunction with ipl announced that it intends to increase the size of the first stage of the terrace project in order to provide greater pipeline capacity at an earlier date 
the first phase of this expansion will provide the capability to transport an additional  barrels per day of heavy crude oil 
after allowing for anticipated light crude oil production declines  total system deliveries are anticipated to increase by  barrels per day 
the first phase of the expansion includes construction of new inch diameter pipeline facilities from kerrobert  saskatchewan  to clearbrook  minnesota 
the new pipeline construction will join existing inch pipeline loops between kerrobert and clearbrook  creating another separate pipeline joining those locations 
approximately million will be spent by the partnership on the lakehead system for the first stage of the terrace project  primarily for new pipeline construction 
ipl filed a facilities application with the national energy board neb in late following neb approval  construction in canada and the us would commence in september with an anticipated in service date of late initial utilization of the new capacity is expected to approximate  barrels per day in utilization of the new capacity is anticipated to increase significantly in later years 
future stages of the terrace project could accommodate additional increases in crude production through cost effective incremental expansions 
the partnership is subject to a rate regulatory methodology that prescribes rate ceilings that are adjusted every july the rate ceilings are adjusted by reference to annual changes in the producer price index for finished goods minus one percent ppifg 
the general partner expects the ppifg to be negative for  however  the ppifg should not decrease enough to have a material effect on operating revenue 
the settlement agreement is benefiting the partnership and its customers by restoring stability and providing predictable tariff rates as customer representatives who are a party to the agreement have agreed not to challenge any rates within the indexed ceiling for a period of five years 
in addition  to the extent allowed under ferc orders or by agreement with customers  the partnership anticipates the possibility of filing for additional tariff increases from time to time to reflect ongoing expansion programs 
specifically  the partnership and customer representatives agreed to the terms of an incremental tariff rate surcharge to recover the cost of  and allow a rate of return on  sep ii 
the rate of return on sep ii will be based  in part  on the utilization level of the additional capacity constructed 
ipl energy projects ipl energy inc ipl energy  the ultimate parent of the general partner  is also engaged in north american crude oil pipeline projects which are related to the ipl and lakehead systems 
the general partner believes that certain of these projects are complementary to sep ii and the terrace project  even though they are not owned by the partnership  since the projects may result in increased deliveries on the lakehead system 
such projects are summarized below mustang in  a us subsidiary of ipl energy entered into a partnership mustang pipe line partners with mobil illinois pipe line company  a subsidiary of mobil oil corporation  to own and operate a crude oil pipeline that connects the lakehead system to the patoka wood river refinery area and pipeline hub south of chicago 
the partnership has entered into a joint tariff agreement with mustang pipe line partners covering future shipments of western canadian crude oil over the lakehead system and the mustang pipeline 
the joint tariff agreement provides for lower transportation costs to shippers desiring access to the patoka wood river market area 
the mustang system has a capacity of approximately  barrels per day 
toledo ipl energy is proposing a new pipeline which would connect the partnership s facilities at stockbridge  michigan to a refinery in the toledo  ohio area 
this pipeline is anticipated to have an approximate capacity of  barrels per day in heavy crude oil service 
wild rose ipl energy recently filed an application with the alberta energy utilities board for approval of a project to construct a new inch pipeline for the delivery of heavy crude oil from the athabasca oil sands region near fort mcmurray  alberta to hardisty  alberta 
at hardisty  the wild rose pipeline would access other pipeline systems including the ipl system in western canada 
this project would provide new pipeline capacity to accommodate anticipated growth in production in the athabasca oil sands region 
the wild rose pipeline is anticipated to have a capacity in excess of  barrels per day 
year computer issue a major issue currently facing virtually all industries is known as the year computer issue 
in an attempt to save disk space  many computer systems and applications were originally programmed to ignore the first two digits of the year 
this could cause many computer systems and applications to fail completely or to create erroneous results unless corrective measures are taken 
the general partner and ipl use many applications in their operational activities  such as oil flow control devices  as well as customer billing  collection and accounting 
in order to address this issue  executive responsibilities for the year project have been established 
the mandate of these executives extends to all facets of the initiative and is not limited to computer hardware and software modifications 
in addition  a year corporate advisory group has been established to assist in the resolution of obstacles to the success of the overall project 
the general partner and ipl have established a year program management office to coordinate all project activities  including the establishment of various management committees to facilitate the identification and resolution of all risks associated with the project 
the general partner and ipl are utilizing both internal and external resources to identify  reprogram and test all of their computer systems and applications for year compliance 
no material resource constraints have been encountered to date and none are anticipated for project completion 
in addition  ipl and the general partner have replaced  or are in the process of replacing  certain key financial and operating information systems 
the replacement of these systems should address year readiness within ipl and the general partner s internal information systems 
furthermore  the general partner is identifying key third parties with which it undertakes transactions including suppliers  customers  creditors  lenders and financial service organizations 
ipl and the general partner intend to assess the year readiness of such key third party contacts and  if required  develop appropriate contingency plans to deal with any that are not year compliant on a timely basis 
however  despite ipl and the general partner s best efforts  there can be no assurance that the systems of third parties with which ipl and the general partner s systems interact will be year compliant on a timely basis or that any such compliance failure would not have an adverse effect on the partnership s operations or its financial results 
ipl and the general partner expect their year readiness project to be completed on a timely basis 
the financial impact of the project on the partnership has not been  and is not anticipated to be  material to its financial position or results of operations
