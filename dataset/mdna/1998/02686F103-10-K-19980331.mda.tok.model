coinsured mortgages under the hud coinsurance program  both hud and the coinsurance lender are responsible for paying a portion of the insurance benefits if a mortgagor defaults and the sale of the development collateralizing the mortgage produces insufficient net proceeds to repay the mortgage obligation 
in such case  the coinsurance lender will be liable to the partnership for the first part of such loss in an amount up to of the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage as of the date foreclosure proceedings are instituted or the deed is acquired in lieu of foreclosure 
for any loss greater than of the outstanding principal balance  the responsibility for paying the insurance benefits will be borne on a pro rata basis  by hud and by the coinsurance lender 
while the partnership is due payment of all amounts owed under the mortgage  the coinsurance lender is responsible for the timely payment of principal and interest to the partnership 
the coinsurance lender is prohibited from entering into any workout arrangement with the borrower without the partnership s consent and must file a claim for coinsurance benefits with hud  upon default  if the partnership so directs 
as an ongoing hud approved coinsurance lender  and under the terms of the participation documents  the coinsurance lender is required to satisfy certain minimum net worth requirements as set forth by hud 
however  it is possible that the coinsurance lender s potential liability for loss on these developments  and others  could exceed its hud required minimum net worth 
in such case  the partnership would bear the risk of loss if the coinsurance lenders were unable to meet their coinsurance obligations 
in addition  hud s obligation for the payment of its share of the loss could be diminished under certain conditions  such as the lender not adequately pursuing regulatory violations of the borrower or the failure to comply with other terms of the mortgage 
however  the general partner is not aware of any conditions or actions that would result in hud diminishing its insurance coverage 
as of december  and  the partnership had invested in three and four  respectively  fha insured certificates secured by coinsured mortgages 
as of december   two of the three fha insured certificates secured by coinsured mortgages are coinsured by an unaffiliated third party coinsurance lender  the patrician mortgage company patrician  under the hud coinsurance program 
the two coinsured mortgages which are coinsured by patrician were delinquent with respect to the payment of principal and interest

patrician is litigating the case in bankruptcy court while negotiating a modification agreement with the borrower 
the general partner intends to continue to oversee the partnership s interest in these mortgages to ensure that patrician meets its coinsurance obligations 
the general partner s assessment of the realizability of the villas and st 
charles place phase ii mortgages is based on the most recent information available  and to the extent these conditions change or additional information becomes available  then the general partners assessment may change 
however  the general partner does not believe that there would be a material adverse impact on the partnership s financial condition or its results of operations should patrician be unable to comply with its full coinsurance obligation

however  since the mortgage did go into default  as of july   the rate reverted back to the original rate of

no payments have been made on the deferred amount due to insufficient cash flows 
on march   ifi foreclosed on the property as successor trustee for the benefit of the partnership 
as a result  the partnership has recognized a loan loss reserve of  for their portion of the estimated loss after considering costs to dispose of the assets and reimbursements from hud 
at this time  the partnership has not made a decision on whether to sell or hold the property 
in connection with the fha insured certificates secured by coinsured mortgages  the partnership has sought  in addition to base interest payments  additional interest commonly termed participations based on a percentage of the net cash flow from the development and the net proceeds from the refinancing  sale or other disposition of the underlying development 
all of the fha insured certificates secured by coinsured mortgages contain such participations

part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources the partnership s operating cash receipts  derived from payments of principal and interest on insured mortgages  plus cash receipts from interest on short term investments  were sufficient for the years ended december   and the basis for paying distributions to unitholders is net proceeds from mortgage dispositions and cash flow from operations  which includes regular interest income and principal from insured mortgages 
although insured mortgages yield a fixed monthly mortgage payment once purchased  the cash distributions paid to the unitholders will vary during each quarter due to the fluctuating yields in the short term money market where the monthly mortgage payment receipts are temporarily invested prior to the payment of quarterly distributions  the reduction in the asset base  resulting from monthly mortgage payments or mortgage dispositions  variations in the cash flow attributable to the delinquency or default of insured mortgages and professional fees and foreclosure costs incurred in connection with those insured mortgages and variations in the partnership s operating expenses

charles place phase ii mortgages 
in addition  mortgage investment income decreased  as discussed above 
this was offset by an increase in interest and other income and a decrease in general and administrative expenses  as discussed above 
net cash provided by investing activities increased for as compared to  primarily due to proceeds from the disposition of the mortgages on skyridge club  woodbine at lakewood apartments  pembrook apartments and carmen drive estates 
net cash used in financing activities increased for as compared to this increase was due to an increase in distributions to unitholders as a result of the prepayment of the mortgage on lakewood villas during the fourth quarter of the net disposition proceeds of approximately
