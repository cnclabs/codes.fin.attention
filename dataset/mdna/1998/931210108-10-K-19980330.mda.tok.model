in addition  extraordinary or unusual items that are non recurring events which would materially distort the comparative measure of ffo are typically excluded 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and cash distributions 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of the company s performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
the company s ffo is not necessarily comparable to similar entitled items reported by other reits 
the company s computation of ffo assumes the conversion of all convertible securities  including minority interest securities
