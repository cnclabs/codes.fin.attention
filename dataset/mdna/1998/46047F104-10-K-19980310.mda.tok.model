integration of tris in january  the company acquired tris  and substantially increased the size of the company s operations 
the future success of the company will depend in part upon whether the integration of the two companies businesses is achieved in an efficient and effective manner  and there can be no assurance that this will occur 
the successful combination of the two companies will require  among other things  integration of the companies respective product offerings and platforms and coordination of their sales and marketing and research and development efforts 
there can be no assurance that integration will be accomplished smoothly or successfully 
the difficulties of such integration may be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations with distinct cultures 
the integration of certain operations has required  and will continue to require  the dedication of management resources which may temporarily distract attention from the day to day business of the combined company 
rapidly changing telecommunications market over the last decade  the market for telecommunications services has been characterized by rapid technological developments  evolving industry standards  dramatic changes in the regulatory environment and frequent new product introductions 
the company s success will depend upon its ability to enhance its existing products and services  and to introduce new products and services which will respond to these market requirements as they evolve 
to date  substantially all of the company s revenues are attributable to wireless customers 
while the company believes that systems and services which it offers to address the needs of the wireless market will also permit it to attract customers in other segments of the telecommunications services industry  there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so 
in addition  technologies  services or standards may be developed which could require significant changes in the company s business model  development of new products  or provision of additional services  at substantial cost to the company 
such developments may also result in the introduction of additional competitors into the marketplace 
management of growth the company has experienced rapid growth and intends to continue to aggressively expand its operations 
the company s total revenues have increased from million in to million in in addition  the company substantially increased the size of its operations  as well as the number of subscribers it serves  by acquiring tris in early january the growth in the size and complexity of its business  as well as its customer base  has placed and is expected to continue to place significant demands on the company s administrative  operational and financial personnel and systems 
additional expansion by the company may further strain the company s management  financial and other resources 
the company s future operating results will depend on the ability of its officers and key employees to manage changing business conditions and to implement and improve its operational  financial control and reporting functions 
the number of the company s employees has increased from as of january to as of february a substantial portion of the company s current employees joined the company in january  in conjunction with the company s acquisition of tris 
the company anticipates that continued growth will require it to recruit and hire a substantial number of new development  managerial  finance  sales and marketing support personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in hiring or retaining any of the foregoing personnel 
the company s ability to compete effectively and to manage future growth  if any  will depend on its ability to improve operational systems and to expand  train  motivate and manage its workforce 
new products and rapid technological change the market for the company s products and services is characterized by rapid technological change 
the company believes that its future success depends in part upon its ability to enhance its current solutions and develop new products and services that address the increasingly complex needs of its customers 
in addition  the introduction of new products or services by third parties could render the company s existing solutions obsolete or unmarketable 
the company s ability to anticipate changes in technology and successfully develop and introduce new or enhanced products incorporating such technology on a timely basis will be significant factors in its ability to remain competitive 
dependence on cellular telephone industry although the company s products have been designed to adapt to a variety of current and future technologies  a significant majority of its revenues to date have been generated by sales of its solutions to service providers in the cellular telephone industry 
a decrease in the number of cellular service subscribers served by the company s customers could result in lower revenues for the company 
although the cellular market has experienced substantial growth in the number of subscribers in the past  there can be no assurance that such growth will be sustained 
reliance on significant customers for the year ended december   revenue from aliant communications co 
and its affiliated companies represented approximately of the company s total revenue  and revenue from sygnet communications represented approximately of the company s total revenue 
as a result of the company s acquisition of tris in january of  the company has several new customers with substantially larger subscriber bases than its then existing customers 
it is likely that certain of the company s new customers  including nextel communications and western wireless will each represent over percent of the company s revenues in the future 
the company has long term contracts with all of its significant customers  however the company s relationships with its largest customers have only been established since january  in connection with the company s acquisition of tris 
there can be no assurance that any such customer will renew its contract with the company at the end of the contract term or may not seek to terminate its contract on the basis of alleged contractual defaults or other grounds 
loss of all or a significant part of the business of any of the company s substantial customers would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  the acquisition by a third party of one of the company s substantial customers could result in the loss of that customer and have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations of the company 
dependence on key personnel  new management the company s performance depends substantially on the performance of its executive officers and key employees 
the company s long term success will depend upon its ability to recruit  retain and motivate highly skilled personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract  assimilate or retain highly skilled personnel in the future 
in addition  several members of the company s senior management team have only recently joined the company 
for example  peter p 
bassermann  the company s president  joined the company in september  paul k 
kothari joined the company in late and began serving as the company s chief financial officer in february  and susan yezzi joined the company in late and assumed the role of the company s executive vice president of operations champaign in february although the company believes that the extensive industry experience of new members of management is essential to the company s growth and outweighs short employment histories with the company  there can be no assurances that the new officers will be successful in assimilating into their managerial roles with the company 
competition the market for billing and management information systems for the telecommunications services industry is highly competitive and the company expects that the high level of growth within the telecommunications services industry will encourage new entrants  both domestically and internationally  in the future 
the company competes with independent providers of transactional systems and services  with the billing services of management consulting companies and with internal billing departments of telecommunications services providers 
the company anticipates continued growth in competition in the telecommunications services industry and consequently the entrance of new competitors into its market in the future 
in addition  merger or consolidation of telecommunications services providers could result in the loss to the company of customers or sales opportunities to competitors 
dependence on proprietary technology the company s success is dependent in part upon its proprietary software technology 
the company relies on trademark  copyright and trade secret laws  employee and third party non disclosure agreements and other methods to protect its proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that its agreements with employees  consultants and others who participate in the development of its software will not be breached  that the company will have adequate remedies for any breach  or that the company s trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by competitors 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the company s efforts to protect its rights through trademark and copyright laws will prevent the development and design by others of products or technology similar to or competitive with those developed by the company 
fluctuations in quarterly performance the company s revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors including the timing  size and nature of the company s contracts  the integration into the company s consolidated financial results of itds intelicom and the lack of actual historical financial results as a combined entity  long sales cycles typically associated with large customers  which require the company to make a substantial investment in the conversion process prior to the generation of revenue  the hiring of additional staff  seasonal variations in cellular telephone subscriptions  the timing of the introduction and the market acceptance of new products or product enhancements by the company or its competitors  changes in the company s operating expenses  and fluctuations in economic and financial market conditions
