student services and administrative expense increased by million  or  from fiscal student services and administrative expense includes the costs of new student recruiting  general and administrative costs and curriculum development 
the increased spending reflects the marketing costs associated with generating the higher student enrollments at devry institutes and at keller graduate school for the terms that began in fiscal and for the summer term  for which whose revenue is included in fiscal marketing costs for the july opening of the new devry institute in fremont  california  and the november opening of the new campus in new york also contributed to the increase 
administrative expenses have also increased from the prior year to support the company s expanding operations 
in addition  spending on implementation efforts for the company s new financial system contributed to the increased expense 
the new financial system  which will be used for reporting beginning in july  will enhance financial controls  reporting and analysis and overcome year processing deficiencies in the previous system 
in addition  the company has appointed a coordinator with responsibility for all other aspects of the year project 
efforts were initiated to address the year processing requirements  focusing initially on mission critical systems and extending to all the company s hardware and software  whether internally developed or purchased  and to ensure compliance by the many providers of products and services to the company 
the company believes that it is on schedule for completion of the project during costs associated with this effort are not expected to have a material effect on the company s results of operations and are being charged to expense as incurred 
the company s fiscal earnings from operations  before interest and taxes  were a record million

fiscal year ended june  tuition revenues in fiscal increased by million  or from fiscal this was the largest tuition revenue increase in the history of the company 
the increase in tuition revenues was produced by several positive factors  including the june acquisition of becker cpa review 
enrollment increases at devry institutes and keller graduate school also contributed to the tuition revenue increase 
fiscal marks the seventh consecutive year at devry institutes in which cumulative total student enrollment for the three semesters during the year has increased from the previous year 
at keller graduate school  cumulative total student enrollment for the five terms of fiscal grew by compared to fiscal enrollment increases at the devry institutes reflect the opening of a new institute in mississauga  ontario  canada  and at keller graduate school  the opening of new centers in oakbook terrace  illinois  and irvine  california 
tuition revenues also increased because of tuition rate increases of approximately  which became effective at devry institutes in march and at keller graduate school in september other educational revenues  composed primarily of sales of books and supplies  increased by million  or  because of sales to the increased number of students attending the company s educational programs 
interest income on the company s short term investments of cash balances decreased by  or  from the prior year because increased capital spending and aggressive debt reduction payments reduced average cash balances in excess of those needed for daily operations 
cost of educational services increased by million  or  in fiscal from the previous year 
cost of educational services incudes the cost of faculty and related staff  which consistently comprises approximately of this expense category 
also included in this expense category are the cost of facilities  supplies  bookstore sales  other student education related support activities and the cost of tuition refunds and uncollectible accounts 
the increase in cost of educational services reflects the additional faculty  staff and facility costs of the becker operations that were not a part of the company s results for fiscal also  there were higher wage  benefit  supply and service expenses associated with the growing number of operating locations and increased student enrollments at devry institutes and at keller graduate school 
depreciation expense increased by million  or  from fiscal as a result of extensive capital improvements and additions  particularly those related to the opening of the new devry institutes in north brunswick  new jersey  and mississauga  ontario  canada  and the continued expansion and upgrading of school laboratories and teaching equipment throughout the system 
tuition refunds and bad debt expense at devry institutes declined by approximately  from last year  even as total student enrollments increased 
this results from educational program and student service quality initiatives that favorably affected student retention 
student services and administrative expense increased by million  or  from fiscal student services and administrative expense includes the costs of new student recruiting  general and administrative costs  and curriculum development 
the increase this year in student services and administrative expense reflects costs associated with becker s operations  which were not included in last year s results 
the increased spending also reflects the marketing costs associated with generating the higher student enrollments at devry institutes and at keller graduate school for the terms that began in fiscal and for their summer terms that started in fiscal general and administrative expense increased from last year and includes the ongoing costs of efforts to restore unconditional financial aid processing at the toronto area campuses 
the increase in student services and administrative cost also includes approximately million in amortization of intangibles and goodwill primarily associated with the becker acquisition 
the company s fiscal earnings from operations  before interest expense and taxes  were a record million 
operating margins  which have been steadily increasing each year  increased again to  up from and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
operating margins were favorably affected by the inclusion of becker s results  where operating margins historically have been higher  by the higher revenues and improved facility utilization from the increased enrollments at devry institutes and keller graduate school  by continued operations improvements and by cost containment measures 
interest expense increased by million from last year because of higher outstanding debt levels resulting from the acquisition  for cash  of becker in june this increased interest expense was offset  in part  during the latter part of the fiscal year by the proceeds of the april stock offering  which were used to reduce debt 
the provision for income taxes of million represents a rate on pretax income 
this year s rate is lower than the rate in fiscal because of a lower effective state income tax rate on the company s us operations 
net income of million  or per share  was a record for any year  increasing by from fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of liquidity is the cash received from student payments for tuition  fees and books 
these payments include cash from student and family educational loans  from other financial aid under various federal  state and provincial programs  and from student and family resources 
the pattern of cash receipts is somewhat seasonal 
the level of accounts receivable from which cash payments are collected reaches a peak immediately after the billing of tuition  fees and books at the beginning of each of the devry institutes semesters  which begin in july  november and march 
collections of devry institute receivables are heaviest at the start of each semester 
in the first two months of each semester  collections typically exceed payments for operating expenses applicable to that period 
accounts receivable reach their lowest level just prior to the start of the next semester  dropping to their lowest point in the year at the end of june 
the end of june corresponds to both the end of the spring semester and the end of a financial aid year  at which time substantially all financial aid for the previous months has been disbursed to students accounts 
both keller graduate school and becker also experience similar seasonality in their cash receipts and expenditures based upon their respective operating cycles 
at june   total company accounts receivable  net of the related deferred tuition revenue  decreased by more than  the decrease in receivables was achieved by further improvements to collection effectiveness  offsetting increases that would otherwise be associated with higher enrollment and revenue levels in the company s educational programs 
the company is highly dependent upon the timely receipt of financial aid funds 
the company estimates that historically slightly less than of devry institutes tuition  bookstore and fee revenues have been financed by government provided financial aid to its students 
these financial aid and assistance programs are subject to political and governmental budgetary considerations 
there is no assurance that such funding will be maintained at current levels 
if funds flow from the federal or state governments is temporarily delayed in conjunction with year processing difficulties  the company could use its available cash resources and borrowings under its revolving term loan agreement until such financial aid funding was restored 
extensive and complex regulations in the united states and canada govern all of the government financial assistance programs in which the company s students participate 
the company s administration of these programs is periodically reviewed by various regulatory agencies 
any regulatory violation could be the basis for disciplinary action  including initiation of a suspension  limitation or termination proceeding against the company 
under the terms of the company s participation in governmental financial aid programs  certain cash received from the us department of education is maintained in restricted bank accounts 
this cash becomes available for general use by the company only after student loans and grants have been credited to the accounts of students and the cash is transferred to an unrestricted operating cash account 
at june   cash held in restricted bank accounts increased to million  up million from the end of the previous year  in anticipation of higher enrollments and financial aid disbursements at the start of devry institutes summer term 
in july  the company entered into an out of court settlement agreement with the internal revenue service irs relative to the statutory notice of deficiency issued by the irs against the company for tax years through the claimed deficiencies related to the amortization of intangible assets purchased during the acquisition of devry institutes in all of these issues have been resolved as a result of the settlement 
the settlement amount was paid in the first quarter of fiscal and is immaterial to the company s financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
cash generated from operations in fiscal reached a record million  up million from last year 
higher earnings and the increased non cash sources of depreciation and amortization accounted for the increased cash flow  more than offsetting the previously discussed higher restricted cash balances 
traditionally  the company has been able to help fund its expansion by operating with negative working capital during most of the year 
the generation and use of cash during the year reflects the seasonal operating patterns discussed above 
during some periods just prior to the start of a semester  cash balances may be supplemented by temporary borrowings under the company s revolving line of credit 
cash generated form operations each year has been sufficient to meet all of the company s operating needs and capital investment needs  while reducing debt on a regular basis 
capital expenditures in fiscal reached a record million  up million from the previous record level set only last year 
capital expenditures were made for expansion and facility improvements  replacement and upgrading of school laboratories and for teaching and administrative equipment 
contributing to s record spending were the construction of a new devry institute in fremont san francisco  california  and the start of renovations for the new devry institute in long island city  new york  both of which are a part of the company s expansion plan for capital expenditures in fiscal are not expected to decline from the record level and should remain significantly above the level of previous years  as construction is completed in new york but begins at the devry institute campus expansion in chicago and at the new campus to be built in west hills los angeles  california 
these new and expanded devry institute campuses  as well as further expansion of keller graduate school and becker into new operating sites will continue to require substantial capital spending in the coming year 
cash generated from operations and existing cash resources have been sufficient to meet capital requirements in the past and  with the company s revolving line of credit  are anticipated to be sufficient to cover expansion plans in the future 
in april  the company completed an offering of million additional shares of its common stock 
net proceeds of the offering were approximately million  of which million was used to repay indebtedness under the company s revolving line of credit 
in march  the company and its banks renegotiated the company s revolving term loan agreement  extending its term to august   and expanding the range of acquisitions or investments within the terms of the agreement 
at june   approximately million of the revolving line had been utilized in the form of borrowings and letters of credit  a reduction of approximately million from the level of borrowing one year earlier 
included in these borrowings is a million cdn letter of credit posted with the ontario ministry of education and training in conjunction with the conditional reinstatement of financial aid processing at the company s toronto area campuses 
future borrowings and or repayments will be based on the company s seasonal cash flow cycle and payment requirements for capital spending and possible future acquisitions 
effective october   the company s bank borrowing interest rate was reduced to a floating rate of libor plus or prime  at the company s option  and has remained at that level based on maintaining certain financial ratios 
at the present time  the company does not have an interest rate swap or other form of protection against increases in the floating rate but does fix the interval of interest rate adjustment on most of its borrowings for periods of six months or less to eliminate some of the possible variability in rates 
the company periodically evaluates its need for additional protection in light of projected changes in interest rate and borrowing levels 
the company believes that current balances of unrestricted cash  cash generated from operations and  if needed  the revolving loan facility will be sufficient to fund its operations for the foreseeable future
