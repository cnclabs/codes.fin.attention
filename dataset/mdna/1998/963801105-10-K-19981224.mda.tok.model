year many computer systems experience problems handling dates beyond the year many existing computer programs only use two digits to identify a year in the date field 
as a result  computer systems and or software used by many computers may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
such systems and programs must be modified or replaced prior to january  in order to remain functional 
significant uncertainty exists in the hardware and software industry concerning the potential effects associated with such compliance 
the company has undertaken a company wide review of its year exposure 
the company has surveyed its supporting systems and has implemented a plan to make its systems year compliant by march all current products are now year compliant 
the company has also been in contact with its major suppliers and vendors  each of which is either year compliant or is completing system upgrades to become compliant 
the company is currently responding to customer inquiries with respect to the year issue 
if modifications and conversions to address the year issue are not completed on a timely basis or are not fully effective  the year problem may have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company expects to implement successfully the systems and programming changes necessary to address the year issue and does not believe the cost of such actions will have a material adverse effect on the company  its results of operations or financial conditions 
the company also relies  directly and indirectly  on the external systems of business enterprises such as customers  suppliers  creditors  and financial organizations for accurate exchange of data 
even if the company s products or its internal systems are not materially affected by the year issue  the company could be affected through disruptions in the operations of issue on its internal systems and business operations  and there can be no assurance that such will not result in a material disruption of its business  financial condition or result of operations
