health care services expense primarily comprises payments to physicians  hospitals and other health care providers under fully insured health care business and includes an estimated amount for incurred but not reported claims ibnr 
the company estimates ibnr expense based on a number of factors  including prior claims experience 
the actual expense for claims attributable to any period may be more or less than the amount of ibnr reported 
the company s results for the year ended december  were adversely affected by additions to the company s reserves for ibnr in the third and fourth quarters 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the company has experienced substantial growth in membership and revenues since it began operations in the membership and revenue growth has been accompanied by increases in the cost of providing health care in new york  new jersey  pennsylvania  connecticut  illinois  florida and new hampshire 
the company does not expect its future growth in membership or revenue  if any  to be similar to its growth in prior years as the company has to redirect its strategic initiatives to attempt to establish profitability

since the company provides services on a prepaid basis  with premium levels fixed for one year periods  unexpected cost increases during the annual contract period cannot be passed on to employer groups or members

the substantial growth in membership reflected continued consumer acceptance of health care plans in the company s markets in general  and the popularity of the products offered by the company in particular 
commercial premium revenues increased million to billion in from billion in membership growth accounted for substantially all of the change as member months of the freedom plan increased when compared with  and member months of oxford s traditional hmos increased over the prior year 
premium rates of commercial programs were about the same in as in software and hardware problems experienced in the conversion of a portion of the company s computer system in september resulted in significant delays in the company s billing of group and individual customers and in adversely affected the company s premium billing 
the company s revenues in were adversely affected by adjustments of approximately million related to estimates for terminations of group and individual members and for non paying group and individual members 
the company is taking steps to attempt to improve billing timeliness  reduce billing errors  lags in recording enrollment and disenrollment notifications  and the company s collection processes and is attempting to make requisite improvements in management information concerning the value and aging of outstanding accounts receivable 
the company believes it has made adequate provision in its estimates for group and individual member terminations and for non paying group and individual members as of december  adjustments to the estimates may be necessary  however  and any such adjustments would be included in the results of operations for the period in which such adjustments are made 
premium revenues of government programs increased million to billion in from million in membership growth accounted for most of the change in medicare as member months increased when compared with the prior year 
the increase in medicaid revenues was attributable to a increase in member months compared with  offset in part by a decrease in average premium rates during average premium rates of medicare programs in were higher than in the company expects that premium rates for commercial business in will be higher on average than in the company s commercial rates are often higher than those charged by competitors  in part reflecting the size and quality of the company s provider network  additional services provided by the company and other features of the company s products 
the company s ability to receive requested rate increases from group customers may be adversely affected by publicity surrounding the losses announced by the company for the third and fourth quarters and claims payment issues involving the company s provider network 
the company believes that commercial premium pricing will continue to be highly competitive and may be more so 
however  the company does not intend to promote revenue growth at the level of prior years because the company s priority in will be to attempt to strengthen its service and systems infrastructure 
revenues may also be adversely affected as a result of the company s decision to reduce its future investment in developing the florida  illinois and new hampshire markets 
moreover  the company expects that revenue growth will be adversely affected by customers concern regarding recently publicized operating losses and provider dissatisfaction with timeliness of claims payment 
in march  the company filed with the new york state insurance department nysid proposed rate increases of and  respectively for its new york mandated individual hmo and point of service plans the new york mandated plans as a result of rapidly rising medical costs in those plans 
the company believes it experiences significant selection bias in these plans which are chosen  on average  by individuals that require more health care services than the average commercial population 
the company had  members in the mandated hmo and  members in the mandated point of service plan as of december  revenues and operating results for would be adversely affected if the nysid does not approve the rates requested or approves lesser increases 
in addition  the company expects that  if granted  significant rate increases in these plans will result in membership attrition  which would reduce revenues and could increase adverse selection bias 
the company is working cooperatively with the nysid with respect to the requested rate increases and other measures to provide affordable health plans in the individual market 
however  no assurances can be given that the nysid will approve these rate increases 
in  the clinton administration and congressional leadership reached an agreement on legislation aimed at balancing the federal budget  which includes provisions for billion in savings from medicare programs over the next five years 
this agreement was enacted into law as the balanced budget act of the act 
the legislation changes the way health plans are compensated for medicare members by eliminating over five years amounts paid for graduate medical education and increasing the blend of national cost factors applied in determining local reimbursement rates over a six year phase in period 
both changes will have the effect of reducing reimbursement in high cost metropolitan areas with a large number of teaching hospitals  such as the company s service areas  however  the legislation includes provision for a minimum increase of annually in health plan medicare reimbursement for the next five years 
the legislation also provides for expedited licensure of provider sponsored medicare plans and a repeal in of the rule requiring health plans to have one commercial enrollee for each medicare or medicaid enrollee 
these changes could have the effect of increasing competition in the medicare market 
in  the company will receive a increase in medicare premiums  minus the user fee assessment of 
of the company s gross monthly medicare premium 
the user fee is applied to all medicare risk contractors by hcfa to cover hcfa s costs relating to beneficiary enrollment  dissemination of information and certain counseling and assistance programs 
on march  hcfa announced a increase in premiums in for all plans in the company s service areas 
however  the user fee for has not been determined and may increase since the clinton administration is seeking legislation authorizing it to collect additional funds 
under the authority provided by the act  hcfa has begun to collect hospital encounter data from medicare risk contractors 
the data will be used to develop and implement a new risk adjustment mechanism by january  given the relatively high medicare risk premium levels in the company s market areas  the company is in significant jeopardy that the new risk adjustment mechanism to be developed could significantly and adversely affect the company s medicare premium ratio going forward 
president clinton has proposed expanding medicare coverage to individuals between the ages of and there is significant opposition to his proposal  and the company cannot predict the outcome of the legislative process or the impact of the proposal on the company s results of operations 
in addition  long term structural changes to the medicare program are currently being considered by a newly appointed national bipartisan commission on the future of medicare 
this commission is required to submit a report to the president and congress by march  the company does not anticipate revenue growth at the level of prior years in its medicare programs because the company s priority in will be to attempt to strengthen its service and system infrastructure and mitigate operating losses 
medicare enrollment could also be adversely affected  perhaps substantially so  by customer concern over recently publicized operating losses and provider dissatisfaction  changes to the company s medicare provider network in certain counties and medical management policies designed to better control medical costs and hcfa s recent site examination of the company  among other factors

the company will  therefore  be withdrawing from those programs effective april  for connecticut and july  for new jersey 
at december   the company had approximately  connecticut medicaid members and  new jersey medicaid members 
premium yields in the company s new york medicaid program approximately  members at december  will be increased effective april  the company expects that premium yields in the company s pennsylvania medicaid program approximately  members at december  were increased effective january  no assurances can be given regarding prospective premium yields from these programs 
third party administration revenues for the year ended december  increased to million from million in  attributable to a increase in member months due to the acquisition of compass ppa  incorporated  partially offset by a decrease in per member per month revenue 
net investment income for the year ended december  increased to million from million in this was principally due to significantly greater realized capital gains in when compared with the company incurred interest expense of approximately million during which reduces net investment and other income for payment of interest on delayed claims in accordance with the company s interest payment policy and applicable law 
final reconciliation with providers may result in higher levels of interest expense 
the company s future results will continue to reflect interest payments by the company on delayed claims as well as interest expense on outstanding indebtedness incurred in see business recent developments financings 
health care services expense stated as a percentage of premiums earned the medical loss ratio was for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  overall per member per month revenue in was substantially unchanged from  however  overall per member per month health care services expenses increased to in from in software and hardware problems experienced in the conversion of a portion of the company s computer system in september resulted in significant delays in the company s payment of provider claims and adversely affected payment accuracy 
medical costs for reflect additions to the company s reserves for ibnr in the third and fourth quarters aggregating million 
these additions represent revisions to estimates of the company s incurred medical costs based on information gained in the process of reviewing and reconciling previously delayed claims and claims paid or denied in error 
a portion of the reserve additions represent revisions to estimates for claims incurred in prior years 
the company s paid and received claims data and revised estimates show significant increases in medical costs in and in the company s medicare  medicaid and new york mandated plans 
the company estimates that its per member per month medical costs increased in and in in its medicare programs 
in its new york mandated plans and its medicaid programs the company s per member per month medical costs increased  and  respectively  in these increases resulted primarily from higher expenses for hospital and specialist physician services and increases in per member per month pharmacy costs of and in and  respectively 
the company reviews its ultimate claims liability in light of its claims payment history and other factors  and any resulting adjustments are included in the results of operations for the period in which such adjustments are made 
the company believes it has made adequate provision for medical costs as of december  there can be no assurance that additional reserve additions will not be necessary as the company continues to review and reconcile delayed claims and claims paid or denied in error 
additions to reserves could also result as a consequence of regulatory examinations and such additions would also be included in the results of operations for the period in which such adjustments are made 
see business government regulation and legal proceedings 
the company is taking a number of steps to address the deterioration of operating results in medicare  medicaid and the new york mandated plans 
the company is pursuing certain provider contracts for its medicare programs pursuant to which a significant portion of the medical cost risk of some of the company s medicare enrollment may be transferred to network providers 
despite these efforts  no assurances can be given that such contracts will be consummated or  if consummated  will successfully control the company s ultimate costs 
in its pennsylvania medicaid program  the company has entered into an agreement to transfer a substantial portion of the medical risk in that program to a third party 
the company is also attempting to implement new medical management policies aimed at reducing costs in various lines of business 
the company has also withdrawn from the medicaid programs in new jersey and connecticut  effective july  and april   respectively 
finally  the company has filed for significant rate increases in the new york mandated plans to reflect rising medical costs in those plans 
the company s results of operations are dependent  in part  on its ability to predict and maintain effective control over health care costs through  among other things  appropriate benefit design  utilization review and case management programs and its case rate and risk sharing agreements with providers while providing members with quality health care 
factors such as utilization  new technologies and health care practices  hospital costs  major epidemics  inability to establish acceptable compensation agreements with providers and numerous other factors may affect oxford s ability to control such costs 
the company attempts to use its medical cost containment capabilities  such as claim auditing systems  physician tracking systems and utilization review protocols  and improved channeling to cost effective providers with a view to reducing the rate of growth in health care services expense 
there can be no assurance that oxford will be successful in mitigating the effect of any or all of the above listed or other factors 
in addition  the company s relationships with many of its contracted providers were adversely affected by the company s computer systems and related claims payment problems which could impede the company s efforts to obtain favorable arrangements with some of these providers going forward 
accordingly  past financial performance is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical performance to anticipate results or future period trends 
the company continues to reconcile delayed claims and claims previously paid or denied in error and pay down backlogged claims 
information gained as the process continues may result in future changes to the company s estimates of its medical costs and expected cost trends 
effective january   the new york health care reform act of the act requires that the company make payments to state funding pools to finance hospital bad debt and charity care  graduate medical education and other state programs under the act 
previously  hospital bad debt and charity care and graduate medical education were financed by surcharges on payments to hospitals for inpatient services 
as contemplated by the act  the company has substantially completed the negotiation of adjustments to rates paid to network hospitals in new york to reflect elimination of these surcharges 
these adjustments are generally effective as of january   but they are not expected to result in savings equal to the cost of the surcharges 
accordingly  the company has filed for increases of between and in certain of its commercial premium rates in new york in addition to normal trend increases in view of the increases in costs attributable to the act

the company also currently expects to record a nonrecurring charge of between million and million in the first quarter of to account for severance and other costs which the company expects to incur in connection with restructuring certain administrative and management functions 
administrative costs in future periods will also be affected by the costs associated with responding to regulatory inquiries and investigations and defending pending securities class action and shareholder derivative litigation  including fees and disbursements of counsel and other experts  to the extent such costs are not reimbursed under existing policies of insurance

inflation although the rate of inflation has remained relatively stable in recent years  health care costs have been rising at a higher rate than the consumer price index 
in particular  the company has experienced significant increases in medical costs in its medicare  medicaid  and new york mandated plans 
the company employs various means to reduce the negative effects of inflation 
the company has in prior years increased overall commercial premium rates when practicable in order attempt to maintain margins  nevertheless  these rate increases have tended to be below those of traditional indemnity health plans and comparable to competing health plans  thereby maintaining the company s competitive position 
the company s cost control measures and risk sharing arrangements with various health care providers also mitigate the effects of inflation on its operations 
there is no assurance that the company s efforts to reduce the impact of inflation will be successful or that the company will be able to increase premiums to offset cost increases associated with providing health care

cash amounts aggregating  have been segregated as restricted investments as required by the new york state department of insurance  the new jersey department of insurance and the pennsylvania department of insurance 
in addition  the company s subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions on their abilities to make dividend payments  loans or other transfers of cash to the parent company  which limit the ability of the company to use cash generated by subsidiary operations to pay the obligations of the parent  including debt service and other financing costs 
premiums receivable at december  decreased to million from million at december  primarily due to adjustments relating to group and individual member terminations and non paying group and individual member previously discussed 
as a result of the previously discussed delays in claims payments  the company experienced a significant increase in medical claims payable during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  but the increase in medical costs payable was mitigated by progress in paying backlogged claims and by making advance payments to providers during the first quarter of and thereafter 
outstanding advances aggregated approximately million at december  and have been netted against medical costs payable in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company has established a valuation reserve of million against the advances 
the company believes that it will be able to recover outstanding advances payments  either through repayment by the provider or application against future claims  but any failure to recover funds advanced in excess of the reserve would adversely affect the results of the company s operations 
the company s medical costs payable  before netting advance claim payments of million  was million as of december  including million for ibnr compared with and million as of december  including million for ibnr 
the increase in medical costs payable reflects additions to the company s medical claim reserves during the third and fourth quarters of totaling million

the liability is also affected by shared risk arrangements under private practice partnerships partnership 
in determining the liability for medical costs payable  the company accounts for the financial impact of the experience of risk sharing partnership providers who may be entitled to credits from oxford for favorable experience or subject to deductions for accrued deficits and  in the case of partnership providers subject to deficits  has established reserves to account for delays or other impediments to recovery of those deficits 
the company believes that its reserves for medical costs payable are adequate in order to satisfy its ultimate claim liability 
however  the company s rapid growth  delays in paying claims  paying or denying claims in error and changing speed of payment may affect the company s ability to rely on historical information in making medical costs payable reserve estimates

in connection with the debt financing required as a condition to the investment under the investment agreement  the company has engaged dlj to act as arranger for a senior secured term loan and as placement agent for a senior unsecured financing  in the aggregate amount of million 
these transactions are subject to the negotiation and execution of definitive agreements  which are expected to contain various conditions  including  among others  receipt of regulatory approvals and absence of material adverse change  and the senior unsecured financing is also subject to placement of the financing with investors 
the terms of these transactions will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond the company s control 
there can be no assurance that definitive agreements will be executed or  if such agreements are executed  that the conditions specified therein will be satisfied 
the investment under the investment agreement and the debt financings described in the proceeding paragraph are herein collectively called the proposed financing

although the company currently expects to complete the proposed financing  there can be no assurance that all relevant conditions will be satisfied 
if the proposed financing cannot be completed  the company believes that other sources of equity and or debt financing could be arranged to finance the company s immediate capital needs  based on discussions with its financial advisors and expressions of interest received from qualified investors in the course of the company s efforts to negotiate the investment agreement and related agreements 
the company currently believes that  in the event such a financing could not be completed on a timely basis  it has the ability and intent to reduce certain costs  including those specified in the turnaround plan and others  and otherwise to generate funds to enable it to support its operations through the company s ability to obtain other financing  and the timing  form and terms thereof  would depend on a number of factors beyond the company s control  including  among others  general economic and market conditions and the possible need for regulatory approvals 
year date conversion the company is currently conducting a comprehensive review of its computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the year date conversion and is developing an implementation plan to resolve the issue 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize the date as the year rather than the year this could result in system failure or miscalculations 
the company is utilizing and will utilize both internal and external resources to identify  correct or reprogram  and test the systems for year compliance 
the company has not completed its assessment number of the year date conversion 
accordingly  the company cannot estimate itsyear compliance expense and the related potential effect on the company s results of operations 
the company is communicating with certain material vendors to determine the extent to which the company may be vulnerable to such vendors failure to resolve their own year issues 
the company will attempt to mitigate its risk with respect to the failure of such vendors to be year complaint 
the effect  if any  is not reasonable estimable at this time
