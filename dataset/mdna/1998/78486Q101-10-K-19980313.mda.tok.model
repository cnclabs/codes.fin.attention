net interest income in  on a fully taxable equivalent basis  increased million  or  compared to the million total in this increase in net interest income was the result of a million  or  increase in interest income  offset by a million  or  increase in interest expense over the comparable prior year period 
the million increase in interest income for  as compared to  was the result of a million favorable volume variance  slightly offset by a million unfavorable rate variance 
the million favorable volume variance resulted from a million  or  increase in average interest earning assets over the comparable prior year period 
the increase in average interest earning assets resulted from strong growth in the company s average deposits  which increased million  or  from to the increase in average interest earning assets consisted of loans  which increased million  plus a combination of highly liquid  lower yielding federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreement to resell and investment securities  which collectively increased million accounting for of the total increase in average interest earning assets 
average loans increased million  or  in as compared to  resulting in a million favorable volume variance 
this growth was widely distributed throughout the loan portfolio  as reflected by increased loan balances in most of the company s technology  life sciences and special industry niche practices  in specialized lending products such as factoring  and throughout the company s loan offices located across the nation 
average investment securities for increased million  or  as compared to  resulting in a million favorable volume variance 
the aforementioned strong growth in average deposits exceeded the growth in average loans during  and generated excess funds that were largely invested in us agency securities  us treasury securities  mortgage backed securities  and municipal securities 
the growth in the investment portfolio reflected management s actions to both increase the company s portfolio of longer term securities in an effort to obtain available higher yields  and to increase as well as to further diversify the company s portfolio of short term investments in response to a significant increase in liquidity 
average federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell in increased a combined million  or  over the prior year  resulting in a million favorable volume variance 
this increase was largely due to the aforementioned strong growth in average deposits during coupled with management s actions to further diversify the company s portfolio of short term investments 
for additional discussion of the company s liquidity and investment management activities  see the item sections entitled interest rate risk management and liquidity 
in  a million unfavorable rate variance associated with loans was partially offset by a combined million favorable rate variance related to federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreement to resell and investment securities  resulting in a decrease in interest income of million as compared to the unfavorable rate variance related to loans resulted from a basis points decline in the average yield on loans from to  and was largely due to increased competition 
the average yields on federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreement to resell and investment securities increased in from the prior year  and resulted from both an increase in short term market interest rates and management s actions to increase the company s portfolio of longer term securities in an effort to obtain available higher yields 
the yield on average interest earning assets decreased basis points in from the comparable prior year period 
this decrease resulted from a decline in the average yield on loans  largely due to increased competition  and a shift in the composition of average interest earning assets towards a higher percentage of highly liquid  lower yielding federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreement to resell and investment securities 
this shift in the composition of average interest earning assets resulted from the aforementioned strong growth in average deposits outpacing growth in the company s average loans during the million increase in interest income for  as compared to  was due to a million favorable volume variance  slightly offset by a million unfavorable rate variance 
the million favorable volume variance was attributable to growth in average interest earning assets  which increased million  or  from the prior year comparable period 
the increase in average interest earning assets consisted of increases in each component of the company s interest earning assets  and resulted from significant growth in average deposits  which were up million  or  from the comparable prior year period 
average loans increased million  or  in as compared to this year over year increase was largely related to the company s special industry niches  specialized lending products and loan offices opened during and excluding the impact of these newer offices  the company s technology and life sciences niche experienced minimal net loan growth during as an active market for public stock offerings  coupled with merger and acquisition activity involving the company s client base  resulted in the payoff or reduction of a number of credit facilities by the company s clients 
the increase in average investment securities during  as compared to  of million  or  was primarily centered in us agency securities and commercial paper 
this increase resulted from the aforementioned strong deposit growth in having exceeded the growth in loans and was the result of management s decision to increase as well as to further diversify the company s portfolio of short term investments in connection with its liquidity and investment management activities 
this increase in average investment securities also reflected management s decision to lengthen the average life of the company s investment portfolio in an effort to obtain the higher yields available due to the steepening of the yield curve during average federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell increased million  or  in  and this increase was also a result of the aforementioned strong growth in deposits coupled with management s actions to further diversify the company s portfolio of short term investments in response to a significant increase in liquidity 
unfavorable rate variances associated with each component of interest earnings assets in resulted in a decrease in interest income of million as compared to the prior year 
short term market interest rates declined during the latter part of and early  and remained relatively unchanged for the remainder of as a result of this decline  the company earned lower yields in on federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreement to resell and its investment securities  a significant portion of which were short term in nature  resulting in a million unfavorable rate variance as compared to the prior year 
the average yield on loans in decreased basis points from  accounting for the remaining million of the total unfavorable rate variance 
this decrease was primarily attributable to both increased competition and a decline in the average prime rate charged by the company  as a substantial portion of the company s loans are prime rate based 
the overall decrease in the yield on average interest earning assets of one percent from to was due to a combination of increased competition  the decline in short term market interest rates as well as the company s prime rate  and a shift in the composition of average interest earning assets towards a higher percentage of short term  lower yielding investment securities  as the company s strong growth in average deposits during outpaced growth in average loans during the year 
interest expense in increased million from this increase was due to an unfavorable volume variance of million and an unfavorable rate variance of million 
the unfavorable volume variance resulted from a million  or  increase in average interest bearing liabilities in as compared to this increase was largely concentrated in the company s bonus money market deposit product  which increased million  or  and was explained by high levels of client liquidity attributable to a strong inflow of investment capital into the venture capital community during  and by growth in the number of clients served by the company 
the year over year million unfavorable rate variance was primarily due to an increase during in the average rate paid on the company s bonus money market deposit product which resulted from an increase in short term market interest rates  as well as to a shift in the composition of interest bearing liabilities towards a higher percentage of deposits in the bonus money market deposit product 
the increase in interest expense for of million  as compared to  was primarily due to a million unfavorable volume variance  partially offset by a favorable rate variance of million 
the unfavorable volume variance resulted from a million  or  increase in average interest bearing liabilities 
this increase was almost entirely related to the company s bonus money market deposit product  which increased million from the prior year due to the high level of client liquidity attributable to the strong inflow of investment capital into the venture capital community and into the public equity markets  and due to growth during in the number of clients served by the company 
changes in the average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities had a million favorable impact on interest expense in as compared to this decrease in interest expense largely resulted from a reduction in the average rate paid on the company s bonus money market deposit product from in to in  partially offset by a shift in the composition of interest bearing liabilities towards a higher percentage of deposits in the company s bonus money market deposit product 
the reduction during in the average rate paid on the company s bonus money market deposit product was due to both a decline in short term market interest rates during the latter part of and early  and to a reduction in the pricing of this deposit product in early provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is based on management s evaluation of the adequacy of the existing allowance for loan losses in relation to total loans  and on management s periodic assessment of the inherent and identified risk dynamics of the loan portfolio resulting from reviews of selected individual loans and loan commitments 
the company s provision for loan losses totaled million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively

income from the disposition of client warrants totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the company has historically obtained rights to acquire stock in the form of warrants in certain clients as part of negotiated credit facilities 
the receipt of warrants does not change the loan covenants or other collateral control techniques employed by the company to mitigate the risk of a loan becoming nonperforming  and collateral requirements on loans with warrants are similar to lending arrangements where warrants are not obtained 
the timing and amount of income from the disposition of client warrants typically depends upon factors beyond the control of the company  including the general condition of the public equity markets as well as the merger and acquisition environment  and therefore cannot be predicted with any degree of accuracy and is likely to vary materially from period to period 
during the years ended december   and  a significant portion of the income realized by the company from the disposition of client warrants was offset by expenses related to the company s efforts to build an infrastructure sufficient to support present and prospective business activities  and to evaluate and pursue new business opportunities  and was also offset by the need to increase the provision for loan losses during those years 
as opportunities present themselves in future periods  the company may continue to reinvest some or all of the income realized from the disposition of client warrants in furthering its business strategies 
letter of credit fees  foreign exchange fees and other trade finance income totaled million in  an increase of million  or  from the million total in  and an increase of million  or  from the million total in the growth in this category of noninterest income reflects a concerted effort by management to expand the penetration of trade finance related products and services among the company s growing client base  a large percentage of which provide products and services in international markets

noninterest expense noninterest expense in totaled million  a million  or  increase from total noninterest expense was million in  up million  or  from management closely monitors the company s level of noninterest expense using a variety of financial ratios  including the efficiency ratio 
the efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of noninterest expense  excluding costs associated with other real estate owned  by adjusted revenues  defined as the total of net interest income and noninterest income  excluding income from the disposition of client warrants and gains or losses related to sales of investment securities 
this ratio reflects the level of operating expense required to generate of operating revenue

average fte were in  compared with and in and  respectively 
the increase in fte from through was primarily due to a combination of the company s efforts to develop and support new markets through geographic expansion  to develop and expand products  services and niches  and to build an infrastructure sufficient to support present and prospective business activities

the higher level of occupancy  furniture and equipment expenses in  as compared to the combined amount incurred in  was primarily related to certain non recurring costs incurred during in connection with the company s move into a new headquarters facility 
these non recurring costs included both the disposal and purchase of leasehold improvements and equipment 
the move into the new facility was completed in the fourth quarter of occupancy  furniture and equipment expenses in and were also impacted by costs related to furniture  computer equipment and other related costs associated with both the company s aforementioned growth in personnel and its geographic expansion during and the company opened new loan offices in atlanta  georgia and phoenix  arizona during  and in west los angeles  california and rosemont  illinois in early  and intends to continue its geographic expansion into other emerging technology marketplaces across the us during future years

investment securities the following table details the composition of investment securities  all of which were classified as available for sale and reported at fair value  at december   and december  dollars in thousands us treasury us    us agencies and corporations discount notes and bonds    mortgage backed securities   collateralized mortgage obligations    obligations of states and political subdivisions    commercial paper    bankers acceptances  other debt securities   other equity securities    total    investment securities totaled billion at december  this represented a million  or  increase over the december  balance of million 
this increase resulted from excess funds that were generated by strong growth in the company s deposits outpacing the growth in loans during  and primarily consisted of us treasury securities  us agency securities  mortgage backed securities  and municipal securities  partially offset by a decrease in commercial paper 
the growth in the investment portfolio reflected management s actions to both increase the portfolio of longer term securities in an effort to obtain available higher yields  and to increase as well as to further diversify the company s portfolio of short term investments in response to a significant increase in liquidity 
at december   there were no investment securities held by the company which were issued by a single party  excluding securities issued by the us government or by us government agencies and corporations  and which exceeded of the company s shareholders equity at year end 
the following table provides the remaining contractual principal maturities and fully taxable equivalent yields on investment securities held by the company as of december  the weighted average yield is computed using the amortized cost of available for sale securities  which are reported at fair value 
expected remaining maturities of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations will generally differ from their contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations with or without penalties 
other equity securities  consisting largely of the common stock of client companies  were included in the table below as maturing after ten years

this risk  known as prepayment risk  may cause the mbs and the cmo to remain outstanding for a period of time different than that assumed at the time of purchase 
when interest rates decline  prepayments generally tend to increase  causing the average expected remaining maturity of the mbs and the cmo to decline 
conversely  if interest rates rise  prepayments tend to decrease  lengthening the average expected remaining maturity of the mbs and the cmo 
loans the composition of the loan portfolio  net of unearned income  for each of the past five years is as follows december  dollars in thousands commercial      real estate construction      real estate term      consumer and other      total loans      total loans at december   net of unearned income  were billion  representing a million  or  increase compared to the million outstanding at december  the increase in loans from the year end total was widely distributed throughout the loan portfolio  as evidenced by increased loan balances in most of the company s market niches  specialized lending products and loan offices

such renewals are subject to the normal underwriting and credit administration practices associated with new loans 
the company does not grant loans with unconditional extension terms 
a substantial percentage of the company s loans are commercial in nature  and such loans are generally made to emerging growth and middle market companies in a variety of industries 
as of december   no particular industry sector as identified by standard industrial codes represented more than of the company s loan portfolio 
management of the company has been undertaking an ongoing evaluation of the economic events occurring in asia during recent months 
based on the results to date from this evaluation  no significant current or forecasted negative impact has been identified with respect to the company s loan growth  credit quality  overall financial condition  and results of operations 
future events and circumstances surrounding the economic conditions in asia cannot be predicted  nor can the impact of these future events and circumstances on the company s loan growth  credit quality  overall financial condition  and results of operations be determined at the present time 
general conditions in the public equity markets  in particular those related to public stock offerings  as well as the merger and acquisitions environment  may have an impact on the bank 
one consequence of an active market for public stock offerings and mergers and acquisitions is the payoff or reduction of a portion of the bank s loans by some of its clients which complete public stock offerings  or merge with  or are acquired by  another company 
such a reduction in outstanding loans  if significant  could adversely affect the company s consolidated earnings 
loan administration authority over the company s loan policies resides with the company s board of directors 
this authority is managed through the approval and periodic review of the company s loan policies 
the board of directors delegates authority to the directors loan committee to supervise the loan underwriting  approval and monitoring activities of the company 
the directors loan committee consists of outside board of directors members and the company s chief executive officer  who serves as an alternate 
under the oversight of the directors loan committee  lending authority is delegated to the chief credit officer and the company s internal loan committee consisting of the chief credit officer  practice managers and loan administrators 
requests for new and existing credits which meet certain size and underwriting criteria may be approved outside of the company s internal loan committee by designated practice managers jointly with a loan administrator 
credits exceeding million must be approved by the directors loan committee 
the loan approval and committee system is administered by the company s credit administration group 
loan administrators assigned to each practice report to the chief credit officer  who also acts as chair of the internal loan committee 
credit quality and the allowance for loan losses credit risk is defined as the possibility of sustaining a loss because other parties to the financial instrument fail to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract 
while the bank follows underwriting and credit monitoring procedures which it believes are appropriate in growing and managing the loan portfolio  in the event of nonperformance by these other parties  the bank s potential exposure to credit losses could significantly affect the company s consolidated financial position and earnings 
lending money involves an inherent risk of nonpayment 
through the administration of loan policies and monitoring of the loan portfolio  management seeks to reduce such risks 
the allowance for loan losses is an estimate to provide a financial buffer for losses  both identified and unidentified  in the loan portfolio 
management regularly reviews and monitors the loan portfolio to determine the risk profile of each credit  and to identify credits whose risk profiles have changed 
this review includes  but is not limited to  such factors as payment status  the financial condition of the borrower  borrower compliance with loan covenants  underlying collateral values  potential loan concentrations  and general economic conditions 
potential problem credits are identified and  based upon known information  action plans are developed 
management has established an evaluation process designed to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
this process attempts to assess the risk of losses inherent in the loan portfolio by segregating the allowance for loan losses into three components specific  loss migration  and general 
the specific component is established by allocating a portion of the allowance for loan losses to individual classified credits on the basis of specific circumstances and assessments 
the loss migration component is calculated as a function of the historical loss migration experience of the internal loan credit risk rating categories 
the general component is an unallocated portion that supplements the first two components and includes management s judgment of the effect of current and forecasted economic conditions on the borrowers abilities to repay  an evaluation of the allowance for loan losses in relation to the size of the overall loan portfolio  an evaluation of the composition of  and growth trends within  the loan portfolio  consideration of the relationship of the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans  net charge off trends  and other factors 
while this evaluation process utilizes historical and other objective information  the classification of loans and the establishment of the allowance for loan losses  relies  to a great extent  on the judgment and experience of management 
an analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the past five years is as follows december  dollars in thousands balance at january       charge offs commercial      real estate  consumer and other total charge offs      recoveries commercial      real estate   consumer and other total recoveries      net charge offs recoveries     provision for loan losses      balance at december       net charge offs recoveries to average total loans the following table displays the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among specific classes of loans december  percent of percent of percent of amount total loans amount total loans amount total loans amount dollars in thousands commercial     real estate term real estate construction consumer and other unallocated  n a  n a  n a  total     percent of percent of total loans amount total loans commercial  real estate term real estate construction consumer and other unallocated n a  n a total  the allowance for loan losses totaled million at december   an increase of million  or  compared to the million total at december  this increase was due to million in additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses  offset by net charge offs of million during the unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses as of december  decreased million  or  from the prior year end 
this decrease was mostly explained by an increase in specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses totaling million which primarily related to two largely unsecured commercial credits aggregating million that were placed on nonaccrual status during gross charge offs for were million and included charge offs totaling million related to two commercial credits  one in the bank s technology and life sciences niche and the other in one of the bank s special industry niches 
gross recoveries of million in included million related to a commercial credit in one of the bank s special industry niches that was partially charged off in gross charge offs for were million  and primarily resulted from five credits  none of which were related to the bank s technology and life sciences niche 
gross recoveries of million in included million related to one commercial credit that was partially charged off in net loan recoveries in of million included million in recoveries from a real estate client relationship that had been charged off in and million in recoveries related to a commercial credit that was partially charged off in net loan charge offs of million in included the partial charge off of loans to two commercial borrowers totaling million 
net loan charge offs in included million in gross charge offs related to real estate credits 
in general  management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate as of december  however  future changes in circumstances  economic conditions or other factors could cause management to increase or decrease the allowance for loan losses as deemed necessary 
nonperforming assets consist of loans that are past due days or more which are still accruing interest  loans on nonaccrual status and oreo and other foreclosed assets 
the table below sets forth certain relationships between nonperforming loans  nonperforming assets and the allowance for loan losses 
there was no difference during  and between the company s nonaccrual loans and impaired loans 
loans placed on nonaccrual status were measured by the company for impairment based on the fair value of the underlying collateral in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
december  dollars in thousands nonperforming assets loans past due days or more    nonaccrual loans      total nonperforming loans      oreo and other foreclosed assets      total nonperforming assets      nonperforming loans as a percent of total loans oreo and other foreclosed assets as a percent of total assets nonperforming assets as a percent of total assets allowance for loan losses      as a percent of total loans as a percent of nonaccrual loans as a percent of nonperforming loans in accordance with sfas no 
 in substance foreclosure loans have been reclassified from oreo to nonaccrual loans 
the reclassified amounts are  and  at december  and  respectively 
the detailed composition of nonaccrual loans is presented in the following table 
there were no real estate construction loans on nonaccrual status at december  and december  dollars in thousands commercial   real estate term  consumer and other total nonaccrual loans   nonperforming loans totaled million at december   an increase of million  or  from the million total at december   as a million net increase in nonaccrual loans during was largely offset by the payoff during the first quarter of of one credit in excess of million that was more than days past due  and still accruing interest  as of december  the increase in nonaccrual loans at december   from the prior year end  was largely due to two commercial credits totaling approximately million which were placed on nonaccrual status during the last half of management believes each of these two credits  based on currently known information  is adequately covered with specific reserves and collateral 
nonperforming loans at december  included the aforementioned credit in excess of million that was more than days past due  and still accruing interest  as of december  the export import bank of the us ex im provided the bank with a guarantee of this credit facility  and the bank received the guarantee payment related to this credit from the ex im in the first quarter of the million increase in nonperforming loans at december   compared to year end  was concentrated in two commercial credits  both of which were paid off during and the significant improvement in nonperforming loans during  compared to the level at the end of  reflected the concerted efforts of management to improve the company s credit discipline and processes and to strengthen its credit administration group staffing 
in addition to the loans disclosed in the foregoing analysis  management has identified six loans with principal amounts aggregating approximately million  that  on the basis of information known by management  were judged to have a higher than normal risk of becoming nonperforming 
the company is not aware of any other loans where known information about possible problems of the borrower casts serious doubts about the ability of the borrower to comply with the loan repayment terms 
oreo and other foreclosed assets totaled a combined million at both december  and the oreo and other foreclosed assets balance at december  consisted of two oreo properties and one other asset which was acquired through foreclosure 
the oreo properties each consist of multiple undeveloped lots and were acquired by the company prior to june the oreo balance  which totaled million at the end of  decreased million during due to the sales of lots related to one of the aforementioned properties 
the one other asset acquired through foreclosure  which totaled million at december   consists of a favorable leasehold right under a master lease which the company acquired upon foreclosure of a loan during the third quarter of deposits the company s deposits are largely obtained from companies within the technology and life sciences niche  and  to a lesser extent  from businesses within the company s special industry niches and from individuals served by the company s executive banking division 
the company does not obtain deposits from conventional retail sources and does not accept brokered deposits 
the following table presents the composition of the company s deposits for the last five years december  dollars in thousands noninterest bearing demand      now      regular money market      bonus money market      time      total deposits      total deposits were billion at december   an increase of million  or  from the prior year end total of billion 
a significant portion of the increase in deposits during was concentrated in the company s highest rate paying deposit product  its bonus money market deposit product  which increased million  or  and in the company s noninterest bearing demand deposits  which increased million  or  from the prior year end 
increased balances during in all of the company s deposit products were explained by high levels of client liquidity attributable to a strong inflow of investment capital into the venture capital community  and by growth during in the number of clients served by the company 
the aggregate amount of time deposit accounts individually exceeding  totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
at december   all time deposit accounts exceeding  were scheduled to mature within one year 
no material portion of the company s deposits has been obtained from a single depositor and the loss of any one depositor would not materially affect the business of the company 
interest rate risk management a key objective of asset liability management is to manage interest rate risk associated with changing asset and liability cash flows and market interest rate movements 
interest rate risk occurs when interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities do not reprice simultaneously and in equal volumes 
the asset liability committee of the bank alco provides oversight to the company s interest rate risk management process and recommends policy guidelines regarding exposure to interest rates for approval by the board of directors 
adherence to these policies is monitored on an ongoing basis  and decisions related to the management of interest rate exposure are made when appropriate and agreed to by the alco 
the company manages interest rate risk principally through strategies involving its investment securities portfolio  including adjusting both the maturity structure of the portfolio and the amount of interest rate sensitive securities 
company policies also permit the limited use of off balance sheet derivative instruments in managing interest rate risk  however  as of december   no such derivative instruments have been utilized by the company in connection with its interest rate risk management process 
the company s monitoring activities related to managing interest rate risk include both interest rate sensitivity gap analysis and the use of a simulation model 
while traditional gap analysis provides a simple picture of the interest rate risk embedded in the balance sheet  it provides only a static view of interest rate sensitivity at a specific point in time and does not measure the potential volatility in forecasted results relating to changes in market interest rates over time 
accordingly  the company combines the use of gap analysis with use of a simulation model which provides a dynamic assessment of interest rate sensitivity 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets anticipated to reprice within a specific time period and the amount of funding sources anticipated to reprice within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of funding sources repricing within that same time period 
positive cumulative gaps in early time periods suggest that earnings will increase when interest rates rise 
negative cumulative gaps suggest that earnings will increase when interest rates fall 
company policy guidelines provide that the cumulative one year gap as a percentage of interest earning assets should not exceed 
the gap analysis as of december  indicates that the company was positioned within these guidelines as the cumulative one year gap as a percentage of interest earning assets was 
the following table illustrates the company s interest rate sensitivity gap positions at december  interest rate sensitivity analysis as of december  assets and liabilities which mature or reprice after after after after day to month to months to months to year to after not immediately month months months year years years stated dollars in thousands interest earning assets federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell  investment securities us treasury and agencies obligations      collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed securities       obligations of states and political subdivisions     commercial paper and other debt securities    other equity securities  total investment securities        loans          total interest earning assets         funding sources money market and now deposits  time deposits     total interest bearing deposits     portion of noninterest bearing funding sources  total funding sources      gap         cumulative gap        total interest earning assets federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell  investment securities us treasury and agencies obligations  collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed securities  obligations of states and political subdivisions  commercial paper and other debt securities  other equity securities  total investment securities  loans   total interest earning assets  funding sources money market and now deposits  time deposits  total interest bearing deposits  portion of noninterest bearing funding sources  total funding sources  gap cumulative gap includes interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions of as of december  principal cash flows are based on estimated principal payments as of december  not stated column consists of equity securities and federal reserve bank stock as of december  not stated column consists of nonaccrual loans of  and overdrafts of  offset by unearned income of  as of december  maturity repricing columns for fixed rate loans are based upon the amount and timing of related principal payments as of december  one application of the aforementioned simulation model involves measurement of the impact of market interest rate changes on the net present value of estimated cash flows from the company s assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items  defined as the company s market value of portfolio equity mvpe 
this analysis assesses the changes in market values of interest rate sensitive financial instruments which would occur in response to an instantaneous and sustained increase or decrease in market interest rates of and basis points  and the resulting effect on the company s mvpe 
policy guidelines establish maximum variances in the company s mvpe of and in the event of an instantaneous and sustained increase or decrease in market interest rates of and basis points  respectively 
at december   the company s mvpe exposure related to the aforementioned changes in market interest rates was within policy guidelines 
the following table presents the company s mvpe exposure at december  and december  related to an instantaneous and sustained increase or decrease in market interest rates of and basis points  respectively 
change in interest rates basis points estimated increase decrease in mvpe dollars in thousands estimated mvpe amount percent december  december  the preceding table indicates that in the event of an instantaneous and sustained increase in market interest rates  the company s mvpe would be expected to decrease  and that in the event of an instantaneous and sustained decrease in market interest rates  the company s mvpe would be expected to increase 
the market value calculations supporting the results in the preceding table are based on the present value of estimated cash flows utilizing both market interest rates provided by independent broker dealers and other publicly available sources which the company deems reliable 
these calculations do not contemplate any changes which the alco could make to reduce the company s mvpe exposure in response to a change in market interest rates 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the preceding table 
for example  although certain of the company s assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
in addition  the interest rates on certain of the company s asset and liability categories may precede  or lag behind  changes in market interest rates 
also  the actual rates of prepayments on loans and investments could vary significantly from the assumptions utilized in deriving the results as presented in the preceding table 
further  a change in us treasury rates accompanied by a change in the shape of the treasury yield curve could result in different mvpe estimations from those presented herein 
accordingly  the results in the preceding table should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results in the event of changing market interest rates 
additionally  the resulting mvpe estimates are not intended to represent  and should not be construed to represent  the underlying value of the company 
the simulation model also provides the alco with the ability to simulate the company s net interest income using either one interest rate forecast simple simulation or a forecast of multiple interest rate scenarios stochastic simulation 
in order to measure  as of december   the sensitivity of the company s forecasted net interest income to changing interest rates  utilizing the simple simulation methodology  both a rising and falling interest rate scenario were projected and compared to a base market interest rate forecast derived from the treasury yield curve 
for the rising and falling interest rate scenarios  the base market interest rate forecast was increased or decreased  as applicable  by basis points in equal increments over a one year period 
company policy guidelines provide that the difference between a base market interest rate forecast scenario over the succeeding one year period compared with the aforementioned rising and falling interest rate scenarios over the same time period should not result in net interest income sensitivity exceeding 
simulations as of december  indicated the company was well within these policy guidelines 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk impacting the company 
other types of market risk affecting the company in the normal course of its business activities include foreign currency exchange risk and equity price risk 
the impact on the company  resulting from these latter two market risks  is deemed immaterial and no separate quantitative information concerning market rate and price exposure is presented herein 
the company does not maintain a portfolio of trading securities and does not intend to engage in such activities in the immediate future 
liquidity another important objective of asset liability management is to manage liquidity 
the objective of liquidity management is to ensure that funds are available in a timely manner to meet loan demand and depositors needs  and to service other liabilities as they come due  without causing an undue amount of cost or risk  and without causing a disruption to normal operating conditions 
the company regularly assesses the amount and likelihood of projected funding requirements through a review of factors such as historical deposit volatility and funding patterns  present and forecasted market and economic conditions  individual client funding needs  and existing and planned company business activities 
the alco provides oversight to the liquidity management process and recommends policy guidelines  subject to board of directors approval  and courses of action to address the company s actual and projected liquidity needs 
the ability to attract a stable  low cost base of deposits is the company s primary source of liquidity 
other sources of liquidity available to the company include short term borrowings  which consist of federal funds purchased  security repurchase agreements and other short term borrowing arrangements 
the company s liquidity requirements can also be met through the use of its portfolio of liquid assets 
liquid assets  as defined by the company  include cash and cash equivalents in excess of the minimum levels necessary to carry out normal business operations  federal funds sold  securities purchased under resale agreements  investment securities maturing within six months  investment securities eligible and available for pledging purposes with a maturity in excess of six months  and anticipated near term cash flows from investments 
bank policy guidelines provide that liquid assets as a percentage of total deposits should not fall below 
at december   the bank s ratio of liquid assets to total deposits was 
this ratio is well in excess of the bank s minimum policy guidelines and is slightly higher than the comparable ratio of as of december  in addition to monitoring the level of liquid assets relative to total deposits  the bank also utilizes other policy measures in its liquidity management activities 
as of december  and  the bank was in compliance with all of these policy measures 
in analyzing the company s liquidity during  reference is made to the company s consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december  see item financial statements and supplementary data 
the statement of cash flows includes separate categories for operating  investing and financing activities 
operating activities included net income of million for  which was adjusted for certain non cash items including the provision for loan losses  depreciation  deferred income taxes  and an assortment of other miscellaneous items 
investing activities consisted primarily of both proceeds from and purchases of investment securities  which resulted in a net cash outflow of million  and the net change in total loans resulting from loan originations and principal collections  which resulted in a net cash outflow of million in financing activities reflected the net change in the company s total deposits  which increased million during  and included million of cash proceeds received during the year from the issuance of company common stock 
in total  the transactions noted above resulted in a net cash outflow of million for and total cash and cash equivalents  as defined in the company s consolidated statement of cash flows  of million at december  capital resources management seeks to maintain adequate capital to support anticipated asset growth and credit risks  and to ensure that the company and the bank are in compliance with all regulatory capital guidelines 
the primary source of new capital for the company has been the retention of earnings 
aside from current earnings  an additional source of new capital for the company has been the issuance of common stock under the company s employee benefit plans  including the company s stock option plans  defined contribution plans and employee stock purchase plan 
shareholders equity was million at december   an increase of million  or  from the million balance at december  this increase was due to both net income of million and million in net capital generated during primarily through the company s employee benefit plans 
the company has not paid a cash dividend on its common stock since  and does not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of december  the table below presents the relationship between the following significant financial ratios years ended december  return on average assets divided by average equity as a percentage of average assets equals return on average equity times earnings retained equals internal capital growth the company and the bank are subject to capital adequacy guidelines issued by the federal reserve board 
under these capital guidelines  the minimum total risk based capital ratio and tier risk based capital ratio requirements are and  respectively  of risk weighted assets and certain off balance sheet items for a well capitalized depository institution 
the federal reserve board has also established minimum capital leverage ratio guidelines for state member banks 
the ratio is determined using tier capital divided by quarterly average total assets 
the guidelines require a minimum of for a well capitalized depository institution 
the company s and the bank s capital ratios were in excess of regulatory guidelines for a well capitalized depository institution as of december   and capital ratios for the company are set forth below december  total risk based capital ratio tier risk based capital ratio tier leverage ratio the company s total risk based capital ratio and tier risk based capital ratio at the end of were unchanged from the prior year end  as growth in tier capital was offset by an increase in total assets 
this increase in total assets was largely in lower risk weighted categories and resulted from the company s strong deposit growth exceeding its loan growth during the decrease in the company s tier leverage ratio from december  to december  was primarily attributable to an increase in average total assets due to the aforementioned strong growth in deposits during the decrease in the company s capital ratios from december  to december  primarily resulted from a significant increase in total assets during which was attributable to strong deposit growth
