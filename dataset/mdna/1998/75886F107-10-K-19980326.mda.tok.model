item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general overview 
the discussion below contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties relating to the future financial performance of regeneron pharmaceuticals  inc regeneron or the company and actual events or results may differ materially 
these statements concern  among other things  the possible therapeutic applications of the company s product candidates and research programs  the timing and nature of the company s clinical and research programs now underway or planned  a variety of items described herein and in the footnotes to the company s financial statements including the useful life of assets  the anticipated length of agreements  and other matters  and the future uses of capital and financial needs of the company 
these statements are made by the company based on management s current beliefs and judgment 
in evaluating such statements  stockholders and potential investors should specifically consider the various factors identified under the caption factors that may affect future operating results which could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements 
regeneron is a new york corporation founded in it is a leader in the application of molecular and cell biology to the search for novel human therapeutics 
the company uses its expertise in growth factors and their mechanisms of action to discover and develop protein based and small molecule drugs for the treatment of neurological  inflammatory  and muscle diseases  as well as abnormal bone growth  obesity  cancer  and angiogenesis 
amgen regeneron partners  the partnership equally owned by amgen inc amgen and regeneron  is conducting human clinical studies of regeneron s brain derived neurotrophic factor bdnf and neurotrophin nt 
the company has a number of research collaborations  including a broad based  long term agreement with the procter gamble company procter gamble 
in january  amgen and regeneron announced that the phase iii clinical trial of bdnf delivered subcutaneously did not demonstrate clinical efficacy in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als  commonly known as lou gehrig s disease 
the trial confirmed the safety and tolerability of bdnf seen in earlier trials but showed no statistically significant difference in breathing capacity or survival between treatment and placebo groups  as measured by the trial s predetermined end points 
the failure of that trial to achieve its primary end points had a materially adverse effect on the price of the company s common stock which declined more than immediately after the announcement of the results of the trial 
after the phase iii clinical trial results were announced  the company retained independent experts in clinical neurology  as well as independent statisticians  to conduct further examinations of the data 
this review by the company and the outside panels indicated that a retrospectively defined subset of als patients in the trial may have received a survival benefit from bdnf treatment 
the panels recommended  among other things  that additional preclinical and clinical investigations of subcutaneous bdnf for als should be undertaken 
bdnf is currently being developed by amgen regeneron partners for potential use in treating als through two routes of administration intrathecal infusion into the spinal fluid through an implanted pump and subcutaneous injection under the skin 
an intrathecal study in als patients is ongoing 
subcutaneous studies conducted by regeneron on behalf of the partnership began in the first quarter of the current and planned future bdnf subcutaneous studies are intended to test whether the survival benefit seen in the retrospective analysis of the phase iii clinical trial can be confirmed through appropriate prospective trials 
in addition  sumitomo pharmaceuticals co  ltd 
sumitomo pharmaceuticals  the company s collaborator in the development of bdnf in japan  has informed the company that it will begin to conduct a phase i safety assessment of bdnf delivered subcutaneously to normal volunteers in march sumitomo pharmaceuticals is initially developing bdnf to treat als 
while intrathecal delivery may be more successful in delivering bdnf to certain motor neurons the nerve cells that degenerate in als  it is not known whether intrathecal delivery will prove any more successful in demonstrating safety and utility in patients with als than the subcutaneous delivery used in the phase iii clinical trial that failed to achieve its primary end points 
the new clinical studies of bdnf delivered subcutaneously for the treatment of als are also based on retrospective analyses of that phase iii clinical trial 
if these or subsequent trials fail to demonstrate that bdnf is safe and effective in the treatment of als  that failure could have a materially adverse effect on the company  the price of the company s common stock  and the company s ability to raise additional capital 
amgen regeneron partners clinical development of nt is currently focused on enteric neuropathies 
the enteric nervous system is a complex collection of nerves that control the function of the gastrointestinal system  including gastrointestinal motility 
amgen regeneron partners has conducted clinical studies of nt in normal volunteers and patients suffering peripheral neuropathies associated with diabetes 
these studies indicated  among other things  that nt is safe and well tolerated at a variety of doses in patients and that  at certain doses  nt causes increased gastrointestinal motility 
based on these results and discussions with gastrointestinal experts  regeneron  on behalf of amgen regeneron partners  plans to commence by mid the first of a series of small phase ii clinical studies of nt in enteric neuropathies 
the initial study is expected to include patients suffering from severe idiopathic constipation 
later studies may be in patients who suffer from constipation associated with parkinson s disease  spinal cord injury  use of opiate pain killers  and other conditions 
no assurance can be given that extended administration of nt will be safe or effective 
the phase i study of nt in normal human volunteers that concluded in was a short term seven day treatment study  while the planned nt clinical studies involve longer treatment 
the treatment of various constipating conditions may present additional clinical trial risks in light of the complex and not wholly understood mechanisms of action that lead to the conditions  the concurrent use of other drugs to treat the underlying illnesses as well as the gastrointestinal condition  the potential difficulty of designing and achieving significant clinical end points  and other factors 
no assurance can be given that these or any other studies of nt will be successful or that nt will be commercialized 
amgen regeneron partners is not planning to pursue additional trials of bdnf and nt in peripheral neuropathy at the present time  because the results of earlier studies were not sufficiently promising 
the results of the company s and its collaborators past activities in connection with the research and development of bdnf and nt do not necessarily predict the results or success of future activities including  but not limited to  any additional preclinical or clinical studies of bdnf or nt the company cannot predict whether  when  or under what conditions bdnf or nt will be shown to be safe or effective to treat any human condition or be approved for marketing by any regulatory agency 
the delay or failure of current or future studies to demonstrate the safety or efficacy of bdnf or nt to treat human conditions or to be approved for marketing could have a material adverse impact on the company
