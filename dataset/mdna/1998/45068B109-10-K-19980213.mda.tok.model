item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of the company s results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the company and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
general the company operates itt technical institutes in states which provide technology oriented postsecondary education to more than  students 
the company derives its revenue almost entirely from tuition  textbook sales  fees and charges paid by  or on behalf of  its students 
most students at the itt technical institutes rely on funds received under various government sponsored student financial aid programs  especially the federal student financial aid programs under title iv of the higher education act of  as amended title iv programs  to pay a substantial portion of their tuition and other education related expenses 
in  the company indirectly derived approximately of its revenues from title iv programs 
the company s revenue varies based on the aggregate student population  which is influenced by the number of students attending itt technical institutes at the beginning of a fiscal period  by the number of new first time students entering and former students re entering itt technical institutes during such period and by student retention rates 
new students generally enter itt technical institutes at the beginning of an academic quarter that commences in march  june  september and december 
the company believes that the size of its student population is affected to some extent by general economic conditions  and that  in the absence of countervailing factors  student enrollments and retention rates tend to increase as opportunities for immediate employment for high school graduates decline and decrease as such opportunities increase 
the establishment of new itt technical institutes and the introduction of additional program offerings at existing itt technical institutes have been significant factors in increasing the aggregate student population in recent years 
a new technical institute must be authorized by the state in which it will operate  accredited by an accrediting commission that has been recognized by the us department of education doe  and certified by the doe to participate in title iv programs 
the approval processes for accreditation and doe certification cannot commence until the first students begin classes 
such accreditation and doe certification processes generally take approximately one year from the first class start date 
certain direct costs incurred with respect to a new technical institute prior to the first class start institute start up costs are deferred and amortized over the first year of operation after the first class start 
since the beginning of  the company has opened new technical institutes six of which started classes in or 
new technical institutes historically incur a loss during the month period after the first class start date 
these losses during the year by institutes in their first two years of operation  together with the amortization of institute start up costs  are referred to as operating losses from new technical institutes 
such operating losses from new technical institutes totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company earns tuition revenue on a weekly basis  pro rata over the length of each of four  twelve week academic quarters in each fiscal year 
under federal and state regulations and accrediting commission standards  the company generally is required to refund a portion of the tuition payments received from a student who withdraws from an itt technical institute during an academic quarter 
the amount of tuition  if any  that may be retained by the company after payment of any refund is immediately recognized in the company s statement of income 
other educational revenue is comprised of textbook sales and laboratory and application fees 
the company incurs expenses throughout a fiscal period in connection with the operation of the itt technical institutes 
the cost of educational services includes faculty and administrative salaries  cost of books sold  occupancy costs  depreciation and amortization of equipment costs and leasehold improvements and certain other administrative costs incurred by the itt technical institutes 
student services and administrative expenses include direct marketing costs which are marketing expenses directly related to new student recruitment  indirect marketing expenses  an allowance for doubtful accounts and administrative expenses incurred at corporate headquarters 
direct marketing costs include salaries and employee benefits for recruiting representatives and direct solicitation advertising expenses 
direct marketing costs  excluding advertising expenses  are capitalized and amortized on an accelerated basis over the average course length of months commencing on the class start date 
marketing costs that do not relate to the direct solicitation of potential students are expensed as incurred 
until february   all cash receipts of the company were forwarded to itt for investment on a daily basis after  in the case of certain receipts  the lapse of applicable regulatory restrictions 
cash disbursements of the company were generally funded by itt out of the cash balances of the company held and invested for the company by itt 
net interest income represents principally interest paid or received from itt and miscellaneous interest paid or received from other parties 
commencing in  itt has paid the company interest on the full amount of any net cash balances invested for the company by itt at an interest rate that was set for a six or twelve month period and was basis points over the most recently published rate for six or twelve month treasury bills  as appropriate  and no longer assessed interest charges on the company except with respect to funds actually advanced to the company in excess of cash invested with itt 
itt performed a number of other services for the company  including the administration of certain employee benefit plans  for which it received compensation from the company 
since february   the company has performed its own cash management functions and no longer has any cash invested with itt 
depending upon current interest rates on short term investments  the company may not be able to obtain the same yields on its cash balances that were being paid by itt 
accordingly  interest income  net may decrease in variations in quarterly results of operations the company s quarterly results of operations tend to fluctuate significantly within a fiscal year because of differences in the number of weeks of earned tuition revenue in each fiscal quarter and the timing of student matriculations 
the company s first and third fiscal quarters have weeks of earned tuition revenue  while the second and fourth quarters have weeks of earned tuition revenue because of two week vacation breaks in june and december 
in addition  revenue in the third and fourth fiscal quarters generally benefits from increased student matriculations as the number of new students entering itt technical institutes tends to be substantially higher in june of all new students in and september of all new students in because of the significant number of recent high school graduates entering itt technical institutes for the academic quarters beginning in those two months 
the company s incurrence of costs  however  is generally not affected by the academic schedule  and such costs do not fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis

liquidity and capital resources in  the company indirectly derived approximately of its revenues from title iv programs 
federal regulations dictate the timing of disbursements of funds under title iv programs 
students must apply for a new loan for each academic year three academic quarters 
loan funds are generally provided by lenders in three disbursements for each academic year 
the first disbursement is usually received either days after in the case of students commencing a program of study or days before the start of the first academic quarter of a student s academic year  and the second and third disbursements are typically received days before the start of the second and third academic quarters of a student s academic year  respectively 
while the timing of loan disbursements to the company is subject to a student s directions to the lender and to existing regulatory requirements regarding such disbursements  which last changed effective july   the company has typically received student loan funds upon their disbursement by the lender 
the doe issued new regulations in november  which became effective july  and which revised the procedures governing how an institution participating in title iv programs requests  maintains  disburses and otherwise manages title iv program funds 
these new regulations require the company to receive such funds in three equal quarterly disbursements rather than the two disbursements previously permitted 
the company estimates that this change decreased net cash provided by operating activities a one time effect by approximately million  and decreased interest income an ongoing effect by million 
the company estimates that this change will decrease interest income an ongoing effect by million to million 
the principal uses of cash are to pay salaries  occupancy and equipment costs  recruiting and marketing expenses  administrative expenses and taxes  including pre opening expenses for new institutes 
until february   cash receipts of the company were forwarded to itt on a daily basis after  in the case of certain receipts  the lapse of applicable regulatory restrictions  and cash disbursements of the company were generally funded by itt out of the cash balances of the company invested with itt 
the company s net cash balances of the cash invested with itt increased from million at december  to million at december  and ranged from a low of million in may to a high of million in november since february   the company has performed its own cash management functions and no longer has any cash invested with itt 
the company has generated positive cash flows from operations for the past five years 
cash flows from operations decreased by million in to million from million in this decrease is primarily due to the decrease in deferred tuition revenue resulting from the july  regulatory change affecting when the company receives federal student loan funds  as discussed above 
cash flows from operations in was million  an increase of million from million in this increase was primarily due to the increases in operating income and deferred tuition revenue resulting from increased student enrollment 
at december   the company had positive working capital of million 
deferred tuition revenue  which represents the unrecognized portion of tuition revenue received from students  was million at december  an educational institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all title iv programs if student defaults on federal student loans exceed certain rates 
two itt technical institutes  located in garland and san antonio  texas  are in danger of losing their eligibility to participate in the federal family education loan ffel and the federal direct loan fdl programs due to their default rates 
see item business regulation of federal financial aid programs student loan defaults 
loss of eligibility to participate in the ffel and fdl programs by both the garland and san antonio  texas itt technical institutes but not by either alone could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company has arranged for an unaffiliated  private funding source pfs to provide loans to the students enrolled at the garland  texas itt technical institute in the event this institute loses its eligibility to participate in the ffel and fdl programs 
this alternative source of student financial aid requires the company to guarantee repayment of the pfs loans 
based on the company s experience with the repayment of title iv program loans by students who attended the garland  texas itt technical institute  the company believes that such guaranty should not result in a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the doe  the accrediting commissions and most of the seas consider the merger to constitute a change in control of the company and the itt technical institutes under their respective regulations 
as a result  effective upon the merger  each itt technical institute campus group will immediately become ineligible to participate in title iv programs 
in order to assure that the students attending an itt technical institute can receive all of the title iv program funds necessary to pay their costs of education for the institute s spring quarter which starts march and ends may  that institute must be recertified by the doe to participate in title iv programs by may  otherwise  none of the students enrolled in that institute could receive title iv program grants to pay their costs of education for such quarter and those students whose loan period began and ended with such quarter could not receive title iv program loans for such quarter 
the company believes that each itt technical institute campus group will regain its eligibility to participate in title iv programs by may   but there can be no assurance thereof 
failure by a material number of itt technical institute campus groups to regain their eligibility to participate in title iv programs by may  would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if no itt technical institute campus group regains its eligibility to participate in title iv programs by may   the company estimates that its financial condition  results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected by approximately million to million pre tax 
if any subsequent academic quarter ends before an itt technical institute campus group regains its eligibility  the students attending any institute in that campus group would not receive any title iv program grants to pay their costs of education for such quarter  and any such students whose loan period began after the institute became ineligible and ended before the campus group regained its eligibility would not receive any title iv program loans to pay such costs for such quarter 
the company s capital assets consist primarily of classroom and laboratory equipment such as computers  electronic equipment and robotic systems  classroom and office furniture and leasehold improvements 
all building facilities are leased 
capital expenditures totaled million during and included expenditures of million for new technical institutes  million to expand curricula offerings at existing institutes  million to replace or add furniture or equipment at existing institutes and million on leasehold improvements 
leasehold improvements represent part of a continuing effort by the company to maintain its existing facilities in excellent condition 
capital expenditures increased by million to million in from million in  principally due to the expenditure of approximately million for the acquisition of new computers in required to accommodate a software upgrade for the company s computer aided drafting technology curriculum 
new institutes have large capital additions in the first two years 
to date  cash generated from operations has been sufficient to meet capital expenditures 
the company plans to continue to upgrade and expand current facilities and equipment 
the company expects that the capital expenditures will be approximately million 
the capital additions for a new institute are approximately million and the capital expenditures for each new curriculum at an existing institute are approximately million 
the company anticipates that its planned capital additions can be funded from cash flows from operations 
cash flows from operations on a long term basis is highly dependent upon the receipt of funds from federal financial aid programs and the amount of funds spent on new institutes  curricula additions at existing institutes and possible acquisitions 
year compliance the company has made and will continue to make certain investments in its software systems and applications to ensure the company is year compliant 
the financial impact to the company to ensure year compliance has not been and is not anticipated to be material to its business  financial condition or results of operations
