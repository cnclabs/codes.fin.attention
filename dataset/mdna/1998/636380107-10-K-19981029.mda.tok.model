year compliance the year issue is the result of computer programs which were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
certain purchased systems used by the company  and for which the company does not control the programming code  use two digits for the year 
the current system used by hac is relatively old and has been slated for replacement with a new system that better meets the information needs as it expands and deals with the current operating environment 
the company anticipates that this conversion will be completed to provide compliance with the requirements to handle the year issue with no significant operational concerns 
the current system utilized by new england is a relatively new operating system 
the company has been advised by the system vendor that all required changes necessary to be compliant with the year issue have been substantially completed and will be implemented prior to the year management currently believes that the financial resources necessary to accomplish year compliance will not be material to the company s financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
however  there is no guarantee that the company s expected results will be achieved 
in addition  actual results could differ materially from those expected results 
the company depends on receipt of payment for services from its payor sources most of which utilize computer software to process those payments 
the company s primary payors include medicare and medicaid programs  insurance companies  other certified home health agencies and long term health care provider programs 
the company is currently unable to predict what effect  if any  the year issue may have on the computer systems of those payors or  in turn  on the company
