liquidity and capital resources the company had cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of million at january   compared with million at january  the primary sources of cash in fiscal came from million net of expenses proceeds from the sale of  shares of convertible preferred stock and million cash borrowings under bank lines of credit 
the primary uses of cash included million used by operations  and approximately million used to purchase short term investments 
as of january   the company had million outstanding under a million bank revolving line of credit that expires in october and is collateralized by funds on deposit in accounts that have been assigned to the lender 
the company also has a million bank line of credit available that expires in october  and is secured by the company s accounts receivable  inventories  equipment  and intangibles  including intellectual property 
this asset based line of credit had an outstanding balance of million as of january  inventories increased since the end of january  from million to million at january  the increase was largely due to the build up of components for the company s dvd mpeg based products 
immediately after the close of the fiscal year  in february  the company raised an additional million in equity capital through the sale of convertible preferred stock in a private placement 
these proceeds will be used to finance manufacturing capability for the company s dvd mpeg and networked video product offerings 
the company s primary sources of funds to date have been cash generated from operations  proceeds from preferred and common stock issuances  and bank borrowings under lines of credit 
the company believes that its current reserve of cash and equivalents and short term investments and the availability of funds under its existing asset based banking arrangements will be sufficient to meet anticipated operating and capital requirements for the next twelve months 
however  the company may have to raise additional capital through either public or private offerings of its common stock or preferred stock or from additional bank financing prior to that time 
there is no assurance that such capital or bank financing will be available to the company when needed 
the estimate of time the company s cash and other resources will last is a forward looking statement that is subject to the risks and uncertainties set forth below  as well as other factors  and actual results may differ as a result of such factors 
factors affecting future operating results the company s annual and quarterly results have in the past and may in the future vary significantly due to a number of factors  including but not limited to new product introductions by the company and its competitors  market acceptance of the technology embodied in the company s products generally and the company s products in particular  shifts in demand for the technology embodied in the company s products generally and the company s products in particular and or those of the company s competitors  gains or losses of significant customers  reduction in average selling prices and gross margins  which may occur either gradually or precipitously  inventory obsolescence  write downs of accounts receivable  an interrupted or inadequate supply of semiconductor chips or other materials  the company s inability to protect its intellectual property  loss of key personnel  technical problems in the development  rampup  and manufacture of products causing shipping delays  and availability of third party manufacturing capacity for production of certain of the company s products 
the company derives a substantial portion of its revenues from sales to the asia pacific region  a region of the world that is subject to increased economic instability 
there can be no assurance that such instability will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future international sales 
any adverse change in the foregoing or other factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
due to the factors noted above  the company s future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends of future periods 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
additionally  the company may not learn of such shortfall until late in a fiscal quarter  which could result in even more immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
further  the company operates in a highly dynamic industry  which often results in volatility of the company s common stock price 
impact of the year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company is in the process of investigating whether any of its products requires modification to make them year compliant 
the company has also been in contact with its significant suppliers and vendors to determine whether the products or services supplied by them are year compliant 
while the investigation has not yet been completed  based on the results thus far  the company does not believe the costs of making its products year compliant will be material 
the company s estimate of costs related to year compliance is a forward looking statement that is subject to risks and uncertainties  including whether management s assumptions of future events prove to be correct  that could cause actual costs to be higher
