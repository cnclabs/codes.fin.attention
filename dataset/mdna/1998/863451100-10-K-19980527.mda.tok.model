management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following sets forth certain factors that have affected the company s results of operations and management believes will continue to affect the company in the future 
expansion strategy in  the company began a major expansion strategy into markets outside of its core california markets 
the strategy was to identify those markets with the population density and other demographic criteria that fit the requirements of the strouds concept 
in addition  a critical factor for choosing a particular market was its potential to achieve a level of critical mass necessary to obtain operating and advertising efficiencies 
as a result  over the past three years strouds opened superstores in the greater chicago and minneapolis markets midwest and superstores in the greater washington dc market 
to date  for the majority of these stores  sales volume has been below expectations resulting in higher store operating  administrative and advertising costs as a percent of sales than is currently experienced in the company s california markets 
as a result of the operating performance of its midwest and greater washington dc stores  the company stopped its expansion into new markets outside of california and established a restructuring plan in part for the purpose of closing underperforming stores in its expansion markets 
management believes the principal factors associated with the lower sales volume in these new markets was the lack of name recognition  number of existing competitors and store size 
the company continues to have an active expansion strategy in california 
this consists of strategic in filling and relocations of existing stores to accommodate store expansion and or demographic shifts in its california markets 
in fiscal  the company opened new store in santa barbara  california and plans to open new store in monterey  california in this continued development activity in california has from time to time negatively impacted the sales of existing strouds stores 
management believes that the benefits of strengthening its market presence and adjusting to demographic shifts in the california marketplace have generally outweighed the reduced sales impact experienced by an existing nearby strouds store 
page change in store format in  the company changed from its original format  which included stores ranging from  to  square feet  to a larger superstore format  which averaged approximately  square feet 
the company has continued to increase the size of its superstores which have averaged approximately  square feet for new and expanded stores opened in the past two years 
since the opening of the first superstore  all of the company s new stores have used the superstore format other than stores opened as outlet stores and the company s prototype home decorating store in irvine  ca 
during fiscal  the company completed the conversion of its remaining original format stores to outlet stores and  additionally  converted of its superstores to outlet stores 
the primary purpose of the company s shift to the superstore format has been to meet the demands of an increasingly competitive environment 
these stores feature improved merchandise presentations  new merchandise categories  higher quality fixtures and an overall ambiance that management believes substantially improves the strouds shopping experience 
the company s superstores  on average  have experienced higher sales volume but lower sales per square foot than the company s original format stores 
as a result  although the company s occupancy costs per square foot have not risen significantly  occupancy cost as a percentage of net sales has increased 
this has adversely affected the company s gross profit  which includes buying  occupancy and distribution expenses 
because of the impact of the shift in store format on average store level performance  results in different periods may not be comparable 
restructuring and asset impairment in light of the factors noted above  during fiscal the company initiated a comprehensive restructuring and cost reduction plan the restructuring plan  resulting in a pretax charge of million 
the restructuring plan is designed to improve the operating performance of the company through the closure or disposition of certain underperforming stores  elimination of underperforming merchandise categories and implementation of cost reduction measures  including workforce reductions  to more closely align the company s cost structure with future expected revenues 
as part of its restructuring efforts  the company has closed stores in its midwest market  in california and in nevada  is currently in the process of closing additional stores in chicago and in washington  dc and is actively looking to close up to additional stores 
the company plans to continue to operate these stores  where appropriate  in the current format or  if circumstances warrant  convert to an outlet format in order to improve cash flow and minimize the ultimate cost of disposition 
the estimated cost of closure  disposition and or liquidation and the time involved is subject to continuing evaluation of these stores and merchandise categories by management 
page cash used related to the restructuring plan of million was primarily related to lease termination costs  teardown expenses  consulting and advisory expenses and employee severance and related costs 
as of february   no changes had been made to the estimated restructuring plan costs and no charges were recorded to operations 
during fiscal  the company recorded a pretax charge of million for the impairment of certain operating assets 
the principal factors leading up to the charge were current and future operating losses on individual operating assets  whereby the carrying value of certain operating assets exceeded the current estimate of future cash flows from the related asset 
in fiscal  the company had no additional assets impaired 
the company will continually evaluate the performance of its operating assets for the factors noted above and  if conditions warrant  write down the value of such assets commensurate with the current and estimated future operating performance

the company has generally been able to pass on increased costs through increases in selling prices 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations the company s business is subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations 
historically  the company has realized a higher portion of its net sales and an even greater proportion of its profits in the months of november  december and january
