ended total old chicago restaurants rock bottom restaurant brewery restaurants total restaurants the old chicago restaurants opened during are primarily located in existing markets throughout the west and mid west 
the rock bottom restaurant brewery restaurants opened during are located in campbell  fresno and long beach  california  englewood  colorado  des moines  iowa  milwaukee  wisconsin and the district of columbia 
due to the maturation of the company s existing restaurant base and the possible effects of opening additional restaurants in close proximity  revenues of certain of the company s restaurants may be lower in future periods than previously experienced 
during  the company approved a strategic plan to reduce restaurant expansion  suspend development of new old chicago restaurants  and close two rock bottom restaurant brewery restaurants and two old chicago restaurants during early such steps were part of an overall restructuring effort to improve restaurant operating profits 
as a result of these decisions  the company incurred a pre tax restructuring charge of approximately million 
such charge includes the estimated costs accrued to close these four restaurants of approximately million  write downs of certain assets to their net realizable value totaling approximately million  and expenses related to the elimination of certain corporate office overhead in response to the planned reduction in future growth totaling approximately  subsequent to yearend  the company closed the old chicago restaurants located in evergreen  colorado and gladstone  missouri  and the rock bottom restaurant brewery restaurants located in houston  texas and overland park  kansas 
restaurant openings planned for include six rock bottom restaurant brewery restaurants 
all leases for new restaurants are either signed or in the final stages of negotiation 
future operating results may be adversely affected by costs associated with developing a significant number of new restaurants over a relatively short time period 
additionally  new restaurants typically incur certain increased costs in the process of achieving operational efficiencies during the first several months of operation 
preopening costs  which are incurred prior to opening a new restaurant but amortized over the first months after opening  and restaurant salaries and benefits are one example of these increased costs 
the accounting standards executive committee of the aicpa has issued for comment a proposed statement of position sop titled reporting on the costs of start up activities 
if issued as proposed  the new standard would require the company to prospectively expense preopening costs as incurred 
as currently proposed  the new sop would not require restatement of prior periods and would be applied as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the sop is first adopted  which would be for the company 
initial application would be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the company operates on a or week fiscal year ending the last sunday in december

results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage relationship to restaurant revenues of certain income statement data and certain restaurant data percentage of revenues years ended december  december  december  income statement data revenues old chicago restaurants rock bottom restaurant brewery restaurants total revenues operating expenses cost of sales restaurant salaries and benefits operating expenses selling expenses general and administrative depreciation and amortization restructuring charge total operating expenses income loss from operations equity in joint venture earnings interest income interest expense other income expense  net income before taxes net income loss restaurant data restaurants open end of period old chicago restaurants rock bottom restaurant brewery restaurants total restaurant operating weeks old chicago restaurants   rock bottom restaurant brewery restaurants total    average sales per restaurant open for full period in thousands old chicago restaurants    rock bottom restaurant brewery restaurants    fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
revenues increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal revenues from the new restaurants which opened during accounted for million of the increase 
the balance of the increase primarily resulted from the restaurants opened during contributing a full year of sales in comparable restaurant sales for the year ended december  were down slightly more than one percent 
when computing comparable restaurant sales  restaurants open for at least six full quarters are compared from year to year 
revenues from the company s rock bottom restaurant brewery restaurants  as a percentage of total revenues  increased significantly to in from in although the company opened seven brewery restaurants and seven old chicago restaurants during the last months  the brewery restaurants generate greater average weekly sales aws resulting in the increase to this percentage 
the company expects revenues from the rock bottom restaurant brewery restaurants to comprise an even greater percentage of the company s total revenues in  as there are no old chicago restaurant openings planned for aws for the old chicago restaurants during were  as compared to  during fiscal a decrease of 
comparable restaurant sales for the old chicago restaurants were down for the year ended december  these decreasing trends in aws and comparable restaurant sales for the old chicago restaurants continue to reflect the ever increasing competitive nature of the restaurant industry 
management also believes that the uneven sales performance among its old chicago restaurants  which have fiscal aws currently ranging from approximately  to  indicates inconsistent execution of the concept at certain locations 
during the third quarter of  the company began implementing an extensive analysis of its old chicago restaurants to direct management s efforts towards improving overall execution in each restaurant by increasing aws in certain restaurants while achieving more consistent profitability 
such analysis covers all aspects of operations including hiring and training of new staff  restaurant maintenance and cleanliness  local restaurant marketing promotions  menu merchandising  service standards and food quality and consistency 
the company has begun to see some benefits from focusing on these areas including improved aws and comparable restaurant sales trends during the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of however  management expects that complete implementation of this program will not occur system wide until mid aws for the rock bottom restaurant brewery restaurants during were  as compared to  during fiscal a decrease of 
comparable restaurant sales for the brewery restaurants were flat for the year ended december  the company anticipated the decrease in aws as most of the brewery restaurants opened during were designed to operate at a slightly lower capacity than the company s previous restaurants 
aws during for this group of restaurants were approximately  as compared to  for the restaurants opened prior to as the company will continue to design certain of its new brewery restaurants with this lower capacity  decreases in aws are expected to continue in the future 
cost of sales 
cost of sales  which consists of food  beverage and merchandise costs  increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and increased as a percentage of revenues to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to new menus implemented in both concepts in late third quarter and early fourth quarter of management believes such cost increases are temporary and result from inefficiencies associated with rolling out new menus 
additionally  although the company benefited from greater purchasing efficiencies during  including certain non recurring benefits in the third quarter of  these cost savings were offset by greater than expected food costs during for the seven brewery restaurants opened during the year 
new brewery restaurants typically incur significantly higher food costs during their first several months of operation due to complexity of the menu items 
as new brewery restaurants begin to achieve operational efficiencies  the company expects that cost of sales as a percentage of revenues may decrease slightly over time 
additionally  the company has engaged an outside consultant to assist in reengineering the brewery menu and streamlining food preparation procedures 
cost savings from such steps are not expected until mid restaurant salaries and benefits 
restaurant salaries and benefits  which consist of restaurant management and hourly employee wages  payroll taxes  and group health insurance  increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal restaurant salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in the increase in labor costs as a percentage of revenues is primarily attributed to two factors significantly higher labor costs associated with the seven new brewery restaurants opened during  and decreases in aws for the old chicago restaurants 
although labor costs as a percentage of revenues for brewery restaurants opened prior to decreased during fiscal as compared to fiscal  labor costs in the new brewery restaurants  most of which operate in higher cost labor markets  more than offset this savings 
labor costs in the new brewery restaurants improved significantly during the fourth quarter of from the third quarter of  and additional cost savings are anticipated over the next several months as these restaurants achieve operational efficiency 
other increases in labor are due to greater costs for management and kitchen labor in the old chicago restaurants 
as the majority of these labor costs are fixed  the decrease in aws resulted in an increase to these costs as a percentage of revenues 
federal legislation effective september  increased the minimum wage rate 
per hour to per hour 
this legislation also provided for an additional increase to the federal tip credit by the same amount  so that the federal minimum wage paid to tipped employees did not increase 
additionally  certain states passed minimum wage legislation to increase rates to amounts in excess of the federal minimum wage 
although a majority of the company s restaurants operate in states that have wage laws consistent with the federal minimum wage laws  the company implemented a menu price increase of approximately in both restaurant concepts late during the third quarter of to help mitigate the anticipated impact of such legislation 
operating expenses 
operating expenses  which include occupancy costs  utilities  repairs  maintenance and linen  increased million to million in fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of revenues  such expenses decreased to in from in this decrease was principally due to a reduction in insurance premium rates  particularly workmen s compensation insurance  as well as a continued emphasis on cost control measures in numerous areas of restaurant operations 
general and administrative g a 
g a expenses increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and increased as a percentage of revenues from in fiscal to in fiscal the significant increase in dollars is primarily due to personnel additions in the areas of marketing  training  information systems  supervision  accounting and finance  and senior management necessary to support the company s expansion program  and approximately million in non recurring charges incurred during the fourth quarter of for executive severance pay and costs associated with the company s exploration of strategic alternatives

amortization of preopening expense as a percentage of revenues fluctuates with the number and type of restaurant old chicago or rock bottom restaurant brewery opened in any given period 
during  preopening expense was amortized for a larger number of rock bottom restaurant brewery restaurants than in  resulting in the increase to preopening expense amortization as a percentage of revenues 
restructuring charge

revenues from the company s rock bottom restaurant brewery restaurants  as a percentage of total revenues  increased slightly to in from in although the company opened only four rock bottom restaurant brewery restaurants during the last months as compared to old chicago restaurants  the brewery restaurants generate greater average weekly sales aws resulting in the increase to this percentage 
aws for the rock bottom restaurant brewery restaurants during were  as compared to  during fiscal the decrease in aws of  is due primarily to the impact the company s restaurant in denver has on the aws computation

due to additional restaurant openings  this restaurant contributed only approximately to total brewery revenues in as compared to approximately of total brewery revenues in aws during for the old chicago restaurants were  as compared to  during fiscal the decrease in aws of  is due primarily to six restaurants that generate aws below the company s targeted restaurant model

general and administrative g a 
g a expenses increased million to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year and decreased significantly as a percentage of revenues from in to in the increase in dollars primarily reflects personnel additions in the areas of marketing  training  information systems  supervision  accounting and finance and senior management as well as increases in overall corporate infrastructure resulting from the company s continuing expansion program 
the decrease of as a percentage of revenues is due primarily to efficiencies gained in administering a larger number of restaurants and reflects results from an extensive cost containment program initiated in the first quarter of depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization  including amortization of preopening expenses  increased million to million for fiscal year from million in fiscal year as a percentage of revenues  depreciation expense was during as compared to in  and preopening expense was in as compared to in the increase in depreciation expense as a percentage of revenues is attributable primarily to two old chicago restaurants and three rock bottom restaurant brewery restaurants opened during the last part of these restaurants experienced higher construction costs than restaurants opened prior to july  including land and building purchases for three of these restaurants 
the increase in preopening expense as a percentage of revenues is attributable primarily to an increase in average preopening costs for certain old chicago restaurants

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the company requires capital principally for the development and construction of new restaurants and for capital expenditures at existing restaurants 
the company has financed its expansion over the last three years principally through cash flow from operations  proceeds from public offerings  borrowings on long term debt and capital lease obligations 
as is common in the restaurant industry  the company has generally operated with negative working capital 
the following table presents a summary of the company s cash flows for fiscal year   and fiscal year ended december  december december  net cash provided by operating activities    net cash used in investing activities    net cash provided by financing activities    decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents    net cash used in investing activities during  and included net capital expenditures of million  million and million  respectively 
these capital expenditures were primarily for the construction of new restaurants  routine expenditures and remodels of existing restaurants  and for leasehold improvements  furniture and equipment in the corporate office 
the average cash investment for leasehold improvements  furniture  fixtures  restaurant equipment  brewing equipment and preopening costs for restaurants opened during these periods is as follows average cash investment per restaurant of of of restaurants average restaurants average restaurants average opened investment opened investment opened investment old chicago    rock bottom restaurant    brewery in certain instances  the company has received landlord contributions in the form of tenant finish allowances  reducing the cost of opening a new restaurant 
there can be no assurance  however  that landlord contributions will be available in the future 
investing activities also include a million use of cash in for the purchase of short term investments 
such investments were sold in and the proceeds included as a source of cash 
although the company has historically leased its facilities  during  the company purchased undeveloped land for two rock bottom restaurant brewery restaurants 
such land was utilized to construct build to suit locations in englewood  colorado and des moines  iowa using the company s newly introduced design prototype 
during september  the company completed a sale leaseback transaction for the englewood location  resulting in a recovery of substantially all its investment in the land and building  or approximately million 
the sale portion of this transaction is reflected in investing activities in the accompanying consolidated cash flow statement 
the company also completed a sale leaseback transaction for the des moines location during the first quarter of  resulting in the recovery of an additional million 
the company estimates that during  the cost to construct and open a brewery restaurant prototype  assuming completion of a sale leaseback transaction  will be approximately million to million  as compared to the estimated to million  before landlord contributions  to construct and open a leased brewery restaurant converted from an existing property 
there can be no assurance  however  that suitable locations for prototype brewery restaurants will be identified  that sale leaseback transactions can be entered into on acceptable terms  or that the costs of acquiring sites and opening new restaurants will not increase in the future 
net cash provided by financing activities during primarily represents net proceeds of million received from the company s public offering during that year 
during  the company secured a million bank revolving credit facility the credit facility  and executed a million first mortgage on real property located in chicago  illinois 
these financing instruments provided cash sources in of million 
the company amended the credit facility in february and again in july to increase the maximum borrowings available to million see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
such amended credit facility provided additional financing sources during of million 
as of december   the company had million outstanding under the amended credit facility 
additionally  the company receives trade credit based upon negotiated terms for purchasing food and supplies  and does not have significant receivables or inventory 
during the third quarter of  the company financed its acquisition of an indirect interest in trolley barn by exchanging  shares of its 
par value common stock see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the corresponding increase in assets and equity is excluded from the above cash flows reflecting the non cash nature of this transaction 
the company estimates that total capital expenditures for  excluding preopening costs and net of proceeds from sale leaseback transactions  will be approximately million 
this includes million in estimated total costs for the six new brewery restaurants  two of which will be prototypes and four of which will be converted from existing properties  million in estimated costs for routine capital expenditures and remodels of existing restaurants  and  for capital expenditures for the corporate office 
there can be no assurance that these estimated capital expenditures will be sufficient for completion of current development plans or that they will not increase in the future 
the company believes that its existing cash balances  cash flow generated from operations and funds available under the amended credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy its currently anticipated cash needs through fiscal however  results of operations could be negatively affected by changes in consumer tastes  national  regional or local economic conditions  demographic trends and traffic patterns  decreased interest income and increased interest expense  among other factors 
in the event the impact of such factors is significant  the company may require additional sources of external financing 
additionally  as the amended credit facility expires in july  the company may seek additional sources of debt or equity capital for its continuing expansion 
there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
year compliance during  the company began a comprehensive review of its computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the year issue 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
the company s system conversion during addressed a significant part of this problem  as the new general financial and payroll software applications implemented were represented by the vendors to be year compliant 
the company is also developing an implementation plan for its remaining year issues  including either modifications or upgrades of substantially all existing restaurant point of sale systems 
total estimated costs to resolve the year problem are unknown at this time  however  the company expects to incur capital expenditures of approximately  during to upgrade the personal computer hardware and software in all restaurants as the next step in achieving year compliance 
seasonality and quarterly results the company s sales and earnings fluctuate seasonally 
historically  the company s highest earnings have occurred in the second and third quarters  but as the company enters new markets  it may encounter different seasonal patterns 
in addition  quarterly results have been and  in the future are likely to be  substantially affected by the timing of new restaurant openings 
specifically  results of operations from new restaurants opening in the first or fourth quarters will experience lower margins initially than new restaurants opening in the second and third quarters 
because of the seasonality of the company s business and the impact of new restaurant openings  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year and cannot be used to indicate financial performance for the entire year 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation although the company does not believe inflation has materially affected operating results during the past three years  inflationary pressures could result in substantial increases in costs and expenses  particularly food  supplies  labor and operating expenses 
additionally  increasing minimum wage rates have the potential to impact all aspects of the company s business due to higher labor rates experienced by its suppliers and vendors 
these labor rates could translate into higher costs for goods and services purchased by the company 
all such increases in costs and expenses could have a significant impact on the company s operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to customers
