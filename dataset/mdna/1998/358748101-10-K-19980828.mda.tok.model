item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations total revenue was  for the fiscal year ended may   a decrease of  or from last year  and a  decrease when compared to two years ago 
the decrease is primarily due to the closing of fifteen unprofitable big boy restaurants at the end of fiscal the closed restaurants contributed  to sales last year  and  in fiscal in addition  fiscal consisted of weeks 
the extra week generated revenue of  strong same store sales gains achieved during the last half of fiscal  stimulated in part by mild winter weather in the company s markets  erased year to date declines reported through the first half of the year 
the second half sales gain is particularly noteworthy considering that the winter was equally mild 
same store sales were moderately higher in fiscal and down slightly in fiscal outside sales  consisting of carryout and drive thru trade  accounted for most of the same store sales increase in fiscal  while dining room sales remained flat 
as home meal replacement has become more popular throughout the restaurant industry  the big boy drive thru carryout menu was reformulated to emphasize combo meals 
each combo meal includes one of the four most popular signature sandwiches  packaged with french fries and a drink and sold at a lower price than if purchased separately 
this proved to be a better value and more convenient for the customer 
the point of sale system also contributed to fiscal sales gains by ensuring that all orders were entered correctly and by the elimination of guest check pricing errors 
menu price increases of approximately were implemented in the first and third quarters of fiscal prices were increased and  respectively  in the second and third quarters of fiscal  and and  respectively  in the first and third quarters of fiscal another price increase is currently being planned for autumn average annual sales volume of a big boy restaurant in operation for the entire fiscal year increased to  from  in fiscal the average volume was  in the comparable week period in fiscal the healthy gain is primarily the result of excluding the fifteen closed low volume restaurants from the average 
at the end of  the company operated big boy restaurants and two quality hotels 
the company did not open or close any restaurants during the year 
hotel sales decreased in fiscal  after achieving strong to moderate sales increases in fiscal years and in addition  other revenue has declined due to lower fees earned from big boy licensees 
at the end of  there were licensed restaurants operating compared with such restaurants at the beginning of the three year period 
the company does not expect a significant reversal of this downward trend in the near term 
cost of sales decreased  or during fiscal  as costs fell to of revenue from last year 
cost of sales was of revenue in fiscal closing the fifteen unprofitable restaurants was the principal factor behind the fiscal improvement 
also  favorable claims experience in the company s self insurance programs allowed estimates for future obligations to be lowered in all three fiscal years 
an analysis of the components of cost of sales follows 
lower food and paper costs were achieved again in fiscal  falling to of revenue from in fiscal  and in fiscal while commodity prices continue to inch upward  the company continues to reap the benefits of effective menu management and the economies of scale afforded by an efficient commissary operation 
in addition  the food cost of carryout and drive thru meals is usually lower than for typical dining room meals 
the savings from the food and paper cost component of cost of sales was more than offset by higher payroll costs  driven by an unrelenting  tight labor market 
recent increases in the federal minimum wage have not materially affected payroll costs as market forces are driving higher pay rates 
payroll and related expenses receive the greatest portion of the insurance reserve adjustments discussed earlier 
without a reduction for lower insurance reserves  payroll and related expense would have been  and of revenue  respectively  for fiscal years  and several factors are driving these percentages downward in spite of higher pay rates 
first  service hours worked in relation to hours of operation were cut in all three fiscal years in a move to lower payroll costs 
the percentage reduction in fiscal also reflects the elimination of higher than average payroll costs in the indianapolis area where ten of the fifteen closed restaurants had operated 
the fiscal reduction from fiscal resulted principally from the permanent structural cost reduction associated with the company s withdrawal from the ohio workers compensation system at the beginning of fiscal a new variable compensation program for restaurant managers was instituted at the beginning of fiscal managers now earn variable compensation equal to certain percentages of cash flows generated at their restaurant 
this change allows incentive compensation to be paid on a more consistent basis  replacing the long standing bonus plan that was based on increases in sales and profits over the previous year that sometimes had the adverse effect of penalizing better managers 
as a result  higher payroll costs for restaurant management can be expected in fiscal the company views the higher compensation as an investment in human capital  the return on which should be lower management turnover and reductions in training and other restaurant costs 
in addition  the higher payroll costs will be offset by the elimination of service trainer management positions and through a fifteen percent reduction in field supervisors 
other operating expenses decreased to of revenue in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal lower manager trainee expenses and lower pre opening costs are reflected in the fiscal improvement 
the elimination of fixed costs in the fifteen low volume closed restaurants also aided the improvement 
included in last year s other operating costs was a charge of  to write off future occupancy costs of certain leased property 
fiscal included a gain of  from the sale of the company s unprofitable hardee s division 
countering the fiscal improvement in total cost of sales were higher payroll  maintenance and depreciation charges to the hotels 
these factors  when combined with lower room revenue  resulted in hotel operations sustaining an operating loss in fiscal  the first such loss since fiscal general and administrative expense in fiscal decreased  or less than fiscal but was higher than fiscal the improvement is principally due to gains recorded this year from dispositions of property unrelated to the fifteen restaurants closed at the end of fiscal last year s expense included the cost of the strategic planning committee s initiatives with respect to the stock repurchase plan  a proxy contest and a charge to lower the carrying cost of certain property held for sale  all of which were largely offset by the  gain on the sale of the big boy farm 
large gains from the sale of non operating real estate were also recorded in fiscal advertising expense declined proportionately with the lower revenue in fiscal  reflecting the company s policy of spending a constant percentage of sales dollars  remaining steady at of revenue in the last three fiscal years 
in september  the company initiated a new marketing relationship with an agency which is conducting consumer research and making recommendations influencing strategic direction  marketplace repositioning and execution 
to date  the research has resulted in communications that include new radio and television commercials that feature consumers favorite things at frisch s distinct signature items like the super big boy  hot fudge cake and freshly made onion rings 
the new direction reallocated media dollars with expanded use of radio to increase the frequency of message delivery and of cable tv to reach more consumers more cost effectively 
results for fiscal were adversely affected by a  impairment of long lived assets charge associated with the closing of the fifteen unprofitable big boy restaurants 
these restaurants sustained pre tax losses of approximately  in fiscal and  in fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company absorbed an additional pre tax impairment of long lived assets charge of  to lower estimates of expected proceeds from the disposal of the remaining closed properties 
recording impairment charges is required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
interest expense in fiscal increased  or over fiscal and over fiscal levels  increasing to of revenue from last year and in fiscal the fiscal increase included  on the loan that funded the company s repurchase of common stock 
despite the fiscal increase  improved operating results caused the ratio of pre tax earnings before interest to total interest expense to improve to to  up from to l a year ago  and up from to in fiscal the fiscal ratio would have been to without last year s impairment charge 
average interest rates on the company s revolving credit loan were slightly higher this year 
interest expense is expected to be lower in fiscal as the tender offer loan is repaid 
however  the reduction will likely be tempered by borrowing needed to construct golden corral restaurants in fiscal provision for income tax expense as a percentage of pre tax earnings was in fiscal  compared with in fiscal and in fiscal improved profits in fiscal caused total federal tax credits to be a lower percentage of pre tax earnings  which resulted in a higher effective rate 
in addition  although the company benefited from the work opportunity tax credit for the first time in fiscal  total tax credits were lower in fiscal due to the loss of fica tax credits reflected in the fiscal and fiscal tax rates that were associated with the fifteen closed restaurants 
subsidiary filing efficiencies in fiscal years and resulted in lower effective rates for state income tax than was provided for in fiscal liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was  generated principally from net income and depreciation 
these funds were utilized for discretionary capital improvements and dividends  and to service debt 
investing activities in fiscal included  in capital costs  an increase of  from last year and  lower than fiscal when three new big boy restaurants were constructed 
this year s costs consisted of  for management information systems  which includes the new point of sale system   to renovate the hotel properties   to remodel big boy restaurants   for commissary improvements and  in routine equipment replacements and other capital outlays 
there was no new restaurant construction nor was any land acquired for future restaurants 
proceeds from property sales amounted to  of which  was from the disposal of six of the fifteen restaurants closed last year 
the company expects to complete the disposal of the remaining nine closed restaurants over the next nine to twelve months 
financing activities in fiscal consisted principally of transactions involving the stock repurchase plan that was completed during the first quarter  when  shares of the company s common stock were repurchased at a cost of  this transaction is more fully described in note f to the consolidated financial statements 
funding was provided by a loan agreement under which  was borrowed 
the terms of the agreement required the application of  of the proceeds from sales of six closed restaurants to be used to repay the debt 
anticipated proceeds from the sale of the remaining nine closed restaurants will also be required to service this debt 
on august   the company announced that it entered into a letter of intent to sell its limited partnership investment in the cincinnati reds professional baseball team 
although the transaction is conditioned upon the execution of a definitive sale agreement  approvals by the national league and the general partner of the partnership and waiver of the other team partners right of first refusal  the  cash deal is expected to be closed on or before september  the transaction is expected to result in a pre tax gain of  pursuant to the terms of the tender offer loan agreement discussed above  the after tax proceeds approximating  will be immediately used to further reduce the loan s outstanding principal 
financing activities in fiscal also included  borrowed under the company s  revolving line of credit 
scheduled long term debt payments of  were made and four regular quarterly cash dividends to shareholders totaling  were paid in fiscal the company expects funds from operations to be sufficient to cover near term capital spending on big boy and hotel facilities  scheduled debt service unrelated to the tender offer loan and regular quarterly cash dividends 
while the company does not currently plan to build any new big boy restaurants during the next twelve months  fiscal is the final year of a five year plan to totally renovate both hotel properties 
the fiscal outlay for hotel renovations is expected to be approximately  twenty one big boy restaurants will be remodeled in fiscal at an average cost of  each
