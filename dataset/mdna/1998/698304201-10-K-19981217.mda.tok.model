traditionally  sales are higher in summer months  when students are not attending school 
impact of inflation in the restaurant business  food  labor  and labor related expenses are the major cost factors that effect profits 
many of the company s employees are paid wages related to the statutory minimum wage and any increase in the minimum wage would increase the company s cost 
also  most of the company s leases require the payment of percentage rentals based on revenues  which along with taxes  repairs and maintenance  utilities and insurance are subject to inflation 
the company expects to be able to offset the effects of inflation through occasional price increases and savings due to volume purchasing 
the federal minimum wage increased 
per hour effective october   and further increased 
per hour effective september  the company implemented price increases in july and september and april to offset the labor cost increases due to higher minimum wage levels and wage rate inflation 
impact of year some computer hardware and software use only two digits to identify the year in date information 
if not corrected  such systems could fail when processing dates for the year or later 
the company is in the process of evaluating its risk and the related costs of updating its computer hardware and software to properly process year and later dates 
the company has identified all significant hardware and applications that it believes will require modification to provide year processing compliance 
internal and external resources are being used to make the required modifications and test year processing 
the key company systems for which year problems might pose a significant risk are the company s restaurant point of sale pos register systems and the company s corporate accounting system 
the company plans to complete the testing process of all significant applications by september  if some of these systems are not year capable by september   there are a number of alternate systems available in the marketplace which have been designed to be year capable 
in addition  the company has communicated with others with whom it does significant business to determine their year readiness and the extent to which the company may be vulnerable to third party year problems 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies will be converted timely  or that a failure to convert by another company will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the total cost to the company of these year compliance activities has not been and is not anticipated to be material to its financial position or results of operations in any given year 
these costs and the date on which the company plans to complete the year modifications and testing are based on management s best estimates  which were derived using numerous assumptions about future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ from those plans 
other uncertainties and trends the company has been notified by nasdaq that its common stock will be subject to de listing from the nasdaq national market effective december  if it is unable to satisfy nasdaq requirements for continued listing 
the two key nasdaq standards in question require common stock listed on the national market to maintain a market value of public float of at least million and a minimum share price of at least if necessary  the company plans to appeal the de listing to nasdaq  but there is significant doubt about the company s ability to satisfy the minimum public float standard for national market listing within the period provided by nasdaq 
the company is therefore planning to request that its common stock be listed on the nasdaq smallcap market 
there can be no assurance that nasdaq will approve the company s listing on the smallcap market 
the smallcap market requires a minimum public float of million and a minimum share price of the company s market value of public float is currently well over million 
the price per share of its common stock has fluctuated above and below during the quarters ended september and december  to address the minimum share price standard  the company s board of directors has authorized a one for three reverse stock split 
the reverse split is subject to shareholders approval at the company s annual shareholders meeting on january  if approved  it is anticipated that the reverse split will help establish a price per common share over the actual price will be determined by the market  and there can be no assurances that the company s common stock will meet the standards for continued listing on either the nasdaq national or smallcap markets 
in recent years  there has been accelerated development of value priced menus and all you can eat restaurant offerings 
pancho s mexican buffet has operated as a value priced  all you can eat concept for over years and expects to compete effectively
