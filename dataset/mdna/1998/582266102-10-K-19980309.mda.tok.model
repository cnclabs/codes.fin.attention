during  the company also expanded its primeline r service to certain additional cities in iowa and illinois and began offering the service to customers in north dakota  south dakota  wisconsin and colorado 
the company plans to continue its efforts to market and provide local  long distance and other telecommunications services to business customers and market its primeline r service to residential customers 
the company believes its efforts to market its integrated telecommunications services have been enhanced by its july acquisition of ruffalo cody  which specializes in direct marketing and telemarketing services  including telecommunications sales  its september acquisition of mcleodusa publishing  which publishes and distributes competitive white page and yellow page telephone directories in nineteen states in the midwestern and rocky mountain regions of the united states  including most of the company s target markets  and its september acquisition of cci  including its subsidiary ccd  which publishes and distributes white page and yellow page telephone directories in states and the united states virgin islands 
in september  the company completed the cci acquisition 
for the period january through september   cci had revenues of million and net income of million 
as a result of the cci acquisition  the company now owns all of the former cci subsidiaries  including ictc  an independent local exchange carrier which was serving with over  access lines in east central illinois as of december   ccts  a competitive local exchange carrier which was offering integrated local  long distance and other telecommunications services to over  customers in central and southern illinois and in indiana as of december   ccd  a telephone directory company that as of december  was publishing and distributing over million competitive annual white page and yellow page telephone directories  an operator service company  an inmate pay phone company  a full service telemarketing agency  a majority interest in a cable television company serving customers in greene  sangamon and menard counties in illinois and benton harbor  michigan  and a minority interest in a cellular telephone partnership serving parts of east central illinois 
the company believes the cci acquisition will allow it to enhance its efforts to offer its telecommunications services in adjoining target markets including expansion into indiana and missouri  states where cci provided telecommunications services 
the company s principal operating expenses consist of cost of service  selling  general and administrative expenses sg a  and depreciation and amortization 
cost of service primarily includes local services purchased from two regional bell operating companies  costs to terminate the long distance calls of the company s customers through interexchange carriers  costs of printing and distributing the telephone directories published by mcleodusa publishing and ccd  costs associated with maintaining the iowa communications network and costs associated with operating the company s network 
the iowa communications network is a fiber optic network that links certain of the state of iowa s schools  libraries and other public buildings 
sg a consists of sales and marketing  customer service and administrative expenses 
depreciation and amortization include depreciation of the company s telecommunications network and equipment  amortization of goodwill and other intangibles related to the company s acquisitions  amortization expense related to the excess of estimated fair market value in aggregate of certain options over the aggregate exercise price of such options granted to certain officers  other employees and directors  and amortization of one time installation costs associated with transferring customers local line service from the regional bell operating companies to the company s local telecommunications service 
as the company expands into new markets  both cost of service and sg a will increase 
the company expects to incur cost of service and sg a expenses prior to achieving significant revenues in new markets 
fixed costs related to leasing of central office facilities needed to provide telephone services must be incurred prior to generating revenue in new markets  while significant levels of marketing activity may be necessary in the new markets in order for the company to build a customer base large enough to generate sufficient revenue to offset such fixed costs and marketing expenses 
in january and february  the company granted options to purchase an aggregate of  and  shares of its class a common stock  respectively  at an exercise price of per share  to certain directors  officers and other employees 
the estimated fair market value of these options  in the aggregate  at the date of grant was later determined to exceed the aggregate exercise price by approximately million 
additionally  in september  the company granted options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of its class a common stock at an exercise price of to certain employees of cci 
the fair market value of these options  in the aggregate  at the date of grant exceeded the aggregate exercise price by approximately million 
these amounts are being amortized on a monthly basis over the four year vesting period of the options 
the company has experienced operating losses since its inception as a result of efforts to build its customer base  develop and construct its network infrastructure  build its internal staffing  develop its systems and expand into new markets 
the company expects to continue to focus on increasing its customer base and geographic coverage 
accordingly  the company expects that its cost of service  sg a and capital expenditures will continue to increase significantly  all of which may have a negative impact on operating results 
as a result of the cci acquisition  the company anticipates a reduction in operating losses and the generation of positive cash flows from operations in the future 
the anticipated financial benefits from the cci acquisition are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the financial benefits the company will actually derive from the cci acquisition may differ materially as a result of a variety of factors  including technological  regulatory or other developments in the company s business  the difficulty of assimilating cci s operations and personnel  the possible inability of management to maximize the financial and strategic position of the company through successful incorporation of cci into the company s operations  and the risks of entering markets in which the company has little or no direct prior experience 
in addition  the projected increases in capital expenditures will continue to generate negative cash flows from construction activities during the next several years while the company installs and expands its fiber optic network and develops and constructs its proposed pcs system 
the company may also be forced to change its pricing policies to respond to a changing competitive environment  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its operating margin 
there can be no assurance that growth in the company s revenue or customer base will continue or that the company will be able to achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows 
the company has generated net operating losses since its inception and  accordingly  has incurred no income tax expense 
the company has reduced the net deferred tax assets generated by these losses by a valuation allowance which offsets the net deferred tax asset due to the uncertainty of realizing the benefit of the tax loss carryforwards 
the company will reduce the valuation allowance when  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized

year date conversion the company is currently working to verify system readiness for the processing of date sensitive information by the company s computerized information systems 
the year problem impacts computer programs and hardware timers using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs that have time sensitive functions may recognize a date using as the year rather than  which could result in miscalculations or system failures 
the company has recently initiated a review of its computer systems and programs to determine which  if any  systems and programs are not capable of recognizing the year and to verify system readiness for the millennium date change 
the company is in the process of confirming with its key vendors that they will be year ready 
the total cost of addressing potential problems  which will be expensed as incurred  are not known as of the date hereof 
based on preliminary information  however  such costs are not currently expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows in future periods 
however  if the company  its customers or vendors are unable to resolve such processing issues in a timely manner  it could have a material adverse effect on future operations 
accordingly  the company plans to devote the necessary resources to resolve all significant year issues in a timely manner 
while the company s efforts are designed to be successful  because of the complexity of the year issues and the interdependence of organizations using computer systems  there can be no assurance that the company s efforts or those of a third party with which the company interacts will be satisfactorily completed in a timely fashion
