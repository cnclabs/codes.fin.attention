liquidity and capital resources the growth of the company s business has required significant investments in new revenue equipment that the company historically has financed with borrowing under installment notes payable to commercial lending institutions and equipment manufacturers  borrowings under lines of credit  cash flow from operations  equipment leases from third party lessors  and proceeds of the company s initial public offering 
the company also has obtained a portion of its revenue equipment fleet from independent contractors who own and operate the equipment  which reduces overall capital expenditure requirements compared with providing a fleet of entirely company owned equipment 
the company s primary sources of liquidity currently are funds provided by operations and borrowings under credit agreements with financial institutions and equipment manufacturers 
management believes that its sources of liquidity are adequate to meet its current anticipated working capital requirements  capital expenditures  and other needs at least through net cash provided by operating activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and respectively

inflation and fuel cost most of the company s operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operation 
during the past three years  the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices and the compensation paid to drivers 
innovations in equipment technology and comfort have resulted in higher tractor prices  and there has been an industry wide increase in wages paid to attract and retain qualified drivers 
the company historically has limited the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and certain cost control efforts 
the failure to obtain rate increases in the future could have an adverse effect on profitability 
in addition to inflation  fluctuations in fuel prices can affect profitability 
most of the company s contracts with customers contain fuel surcharge provisions 
although the company historically has been able to pass through most long term increases in fuel prices and taxes to customers in the form of surcharges and higher rates  shorter term increases are not fully recovered 
seasonality in the trucking industry  results of operations show a seasonal pattern because customers generally reduce shipments during the winter season  and the company experiences some seasonality due to the open  flatbed nature of the majority of its trailers 
the company at times has experienced delays in meeting its shipment schedules as a result of severe weather conditions  particularly during the winter months 
in addition  the company s operating expenses have been higher in the winter months due to decreased fuel efficiency and increased maintenance costs in colder weather 
year the company has identified fifteen year issues  and has successfully written and tested programs to deal with seven of these issues 
it is anticipated that programs addressing the remaining issues will be written by the end of all programs are expected to be fully tested and problems resolved by june  management expects the year issues to have minimal impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity  and capital resources 
cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements the company may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements 
written forward looking statements may appear in documents filed with the securities and exchange commission  in press releases  and in reports to stockholders 
the private securities litigation reform act of contains a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
the company relies on this safe harbor in making such disclosures 
in connection with this safe harbor provision  the company is hereby identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement made by or on behalf of the company 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  the following economic factors  fuel prices 
negative economic factors such as recessions  downturns in customers business cycles  surplus inventories  inflation  and higher interest rates could impair the company s operating results by decreasing equipment utilization or increasing costs of operations 
increases in fuel prices usually are not fully recovered 
accordingly  high fuel prices can have a negative impact on the company s profitability 
resale of used revenue equipment 
the company historically has recognized a gain on the sale of its revenue equipment 
the market for used equipment has experienced greater supply than demand in through if the resale value of the company s revenue equipment were to decline  the company could find it necessary to dispose of its equipment at lower prices or retain some of its equipment longer  with a resulting increase in operating expenses 
may contain forward looking statements 
recruitment  retention  and compensation of qualified drivers and independent contractors 
competition for drivers and independent contractors is intense in the trucking industry 
there is  and historically has been  an industry wide shortage of qualified drivers and independent contractors 
this shortage could force the company to significantly increase the compensation it pays to driver employees and independent contractors or curtail the company s growth 
competition 
the trucking industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
the company competes with other truckload carriers  private fleets operated by existing and potential customers  and to some extent railroads and rail intermodal service 
competition is based primarily on service  efficiency  and freight rates 
many competitors offer transportation service at lower rates than the company 
the company s results could suffer if it cannot obtain higher rates than competitors that offer a lower level of service 
acquisitions 
a significant portion of the company s growth since june has occurred through acquisitions  and acquisitions are an important component of the company s growth strategy 
management must continue to identify desirable target companies and negotiate  finance  and close acceptable transactions or the company s growth could suffer
