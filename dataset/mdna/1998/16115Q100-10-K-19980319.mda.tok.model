general in  chart industries experienced a percent increase in net income over the prior year 
a large portion of this increase can be attributed to a strong demand for industrial gas and hydrocarbon processing equipment  including heat exchangers  cold boxes  cryogenic tanks and assorted system components 
also contributing to the increase in net income in was the ligo project  the company s largest contract to date  on which the company s progress at the end of was about two thirds complete 
the company has seen a tremendous increase in the demand for both industrial gas and hydrocarbon processing equipment through its order bookings in the last two years 
new orders in these areas were million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
backlog in these two areas at december   totaled million and the company s total consolidated backlog was million

sales in the industrial gas equipment area increased million over the prior year  almost entirely in cryogenic tanks and trailers  primarily due to the acquisition of cryenco 
special products sales also increased by million in much of the sales improvement in this market is the result of vacuum equipment being supplied to the ligo project  the sales of which totaled approximately million during  as well as increased sales of cryogenic components 
gross profit for increased million or percent from levels 
the gross margin increased from percent in to percent in as in sales  a large portion of the improvement in both gross profit and in gross margin came from the hydrocarbon processing equipment market

however  the cold box engineering and fabrication market also responded with better productivity and volume 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense totaled million for  an increase of million from however  as a percentage of sales  sg a expense decreased from percent in to percent in this improvement is the result of increasing volume relative to the fixed overhead 
the million increase in sg a expense is largely driven by the variable expenses of profit sharing  management incentive compensation and selling commissions  all of which are closely tied to profitability and sales levels 
in addition  the acquisition of cryenco added million of sg a expense during the five months its results were included in the company s results 
net interest expense declined during the expense is related both to the debt resulting from the acquisition of cryenco  which was outstanding for approximately one quarter before the proceeds from the stock offering were used to pay down all borrowings under the credit facility and the irb which remained outstanding throughout the year 
as a result of the continued growth of the company s brazed aluminum heat exchanger operations and the addition of cryenco  total employment has increased percent to  employees 
the company believes that this increase is appropriately commensurate with the company s annual revenue growth of percent in the last three years 
years ended december  and sales for were million  an increase of million or percent over the largest increase in sales over came in industrial gas equipment totaling million  with increases of million in cryogenic tanks  million in brazed aluminum heat exchangers  million in cold boxes and million in assorted cryogenic components during sales in the hydrocarbon processing equipment area increased million  a majority of which was in brazed aluminum heat exchanges  which were for the most part supplying an increase in the demand for ethylene related equipment 
sales to the special products market increased in much of the sales improvement in this market was the result of vacuum equipment being supplied to the ligo project  which totaled approximately million during gross profit for increased million or percent from levels 
the gross profit margin increased from percent in to percent in as in sales  a large portion of the improvement in both gross profit and in gross profit margin came from the industrial gas sector 
the most significant improvement was in the cryogenic tank business  which was restructured in this business moved from a negative gross profit margin to a gross profit margin level consistent with the company s other industrial gas products 
the brazed aluminum heat exchanger market also saw large volume and price improvement in as the ligo job progresses toward completion  it is having a positive effect in the special products area  where the margin percentage has grown to percent from percent 
selling  general and administrative sg a costs totaled million for  an increase of million from as a percentage of sales  sg a has decreased from percent in to percent in this improvement is the result of increasing volume relative to the fixed overheads

capital expenditures in   and were million  million and million  respectively 
the and capital expenditures relate mainly to the expansion of capacity in the brazed aluminum heat exchanger operation  as well as general throughput enhancing expenditures at the company s other operations

on july   the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of cryenco  a denver  colorado based manufacturer of cryogenic tanks and related products for the transportation  storage and dispensing of lng and liquefied argon  oxygen  and nitrogen
