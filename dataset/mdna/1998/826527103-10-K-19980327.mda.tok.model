partially offsetting the increase in income was an increase of in non interest expense and an increase of in the provision for possible loan and lease losses 
the following table summarizes the operating results for the years ended december    and amounts in thousands except percentage amounts december  over over amount percentage amount percentage total interest income      total interest expense      net interest income      provision for possible loan and lease losses     net interest income after provision for possible loan and lease losses      total non interest income     total non interest expense     income before provision for taxes      provision for income taxes     net income      increase decrease over previous year s amount 
net interest income 
net interest income is influenced by a number of factors such as the volume and distribu tion of interest earning assets  the rate charged on loans for interest and fees  the rate earned on investments and federal funds sold and the rate paid for deposits and other liabilities 
the following table sets forth in thousands  for the periods indicated  a summary of the changes in interest income and interest expense resulting from changes in volume and from changes in rates 
income from tax exempt securities has not been presented on a tax equivalent basis as it is not significant 
for purposes of this table  the change not solely attributable to volume or rate has been allocated to change due to rate 
over over volume rate total volume rate total increase decrease in interest income loans       mutual funds taxable securities  tax exempt securities federal funds sold other total       increase decrease in interest expense deposits savings deposits transaction accounts   time deposits     total     other convertible debentures total     increase in net interest income       as disclosed in the foregoing table  the company s net interest income in and increased over preceding years 
in both and volume increases were primarily related to an increase in the asset size of the company 
during and  total daily average assets increased by and  respectively 
during these same periods  the volume component of the increase in net interest income was and  respectively 
during and  the rate of increase in the volume component of the increase in net interest income exceeded the increase in average daily assets  primarily as a result of an increase in the percentage of average interest earning assets to average total assets from in to during and in this increase in average interest earning assets was partially offset in by a decrease in average non interest bearing deposits as a percentage of average total deposits from in to in during this percent increased to 
during  and in  the company found itself in the position of funding much of its growth through the use of interest bearing deposits 
the company charges interest rates and fees in accordance with general economic conditions  capital and liquidity constraints  and desired net interest margin levels 
approximately of the company s loan portfolio consists of variable rate loans tied to the prime rate for leading banks and as used by the company prime rate 
an additional are variable rates tied to other indexes 
the prime rate is influenced by forces outside the company s control 
because the company has a lower volume of variable rate deposits than variable rate loans  the company would expect to incur a reduction in its net interest margin when interest rates fall  and when interest rates rise  the reverse would be expected to apply 
during the first quarter of the company moved to mitigate the effect of the change in the prime rate on its net interest income by entering into a three year million notional amount interest rate swap agreement with a major bank 
under this agreement the other bank pays a fixed rate of and receives from the company the prime rate 
if prime increases by  the company would pay the other bank thousand on an annual basis 
conversely  if prime decreases by  the other bank would pay the company thousand on an annual basis 
at the current prime rate of  the company will pay the other bank thousand annually 
any payments made or received by the company under the terms of the agreement are more than offset by the corresponding increase or decrease in interest on its variable rate loans 
this transaction has a similar effect to that of converting approximately of the company s variable rate loans to a fixed rate

during and the company has decreased its reliance on short term us securities in funding its liquidity needs while increasing its holdings of longer term tax exempt securities

cash and due from banks and federal funds sold as a percentage of total deposits were at december  as compared to at december  although a decrease in the percentage for was experienced this was offset by the additional liquidity provided by the increase in sba loans available for sale

exclusive of the securitization this increase would have totaled million 
the increase in other loans reflects the company s efforts to expand and diversify its non sba lending activities

the million increase in the loan portfolio since december  was funded with increased time deposits  an increase in other deposits acquired at the company s four branches opened in  the acquisition of mercantile bank and growth in the company s northern nevada operations 
the company is planning a securitization approximately million of sba and similar loans in these loans are transferred to held for sale status once they are identified

deposits increased by million from million at december  to million at december  this included increases of million in interest bearing transaction accounts  million in non interest bearing demand accounts  million in time deposits and million in savings accounts 
the increase in deposits is primarily attributable to the mercantile acquisition and growth in our larger branches 
deposits at the downtown sacramento branch were million at december  total deposits at the company s main sacramento branch and its northern nevada branches increased by million and million  respectively  from december  levels 
during the same period  out of area certificates of deposit decreased by million  as the proceeds of the securitization were used to reduce the company s reliance on these funds 
in part to mitigate the effect of seasonality of its deposit sources which is due to the local tourist based economy in part of the company s service area and in part to provide interim financing of loans the company intends to securitize  sierrawest bank utilizes a money desk to solicit out of area cds 
these cds supplement its other deposit sources  provide additional liquidity and additionally  help support its loan growth 
these deposits  which at december   and totaled million  million and million  respectively  represented  and of total deposits as of december   and  respectively 
to attract out of area cds  sierrawest bank subscribes to a listing service which lists nationally the rate the bank is prepared to pay 
customers call sierrawest bank directly and place deposits 
additionally  beginning in sierrawest bank began accepting referrals by brokers which can result in a slightly lower cost of those deposits 
at december  million of cd s have been acquired through broker referrals 
to attract deposits  sierrawest bank pays a market rate which may at times be above the comparable rate offered by sierrawest bank to its local depositors 
the overhead costs associated with these out of area deposits is  however  lower than that for local deposits since local deposits require the use of bank branch facilities and hence the company believes the cost of these funds does not normally exceed the cost sierrawest bank incurs to generate comparable deposits through its branch system 
while out of area deposits are acquired at an acceptable cost  sierrawest bank monitors the level of these deposits because it is concerned that out of area deposits are more rate sensitive and volatile and that there may be some exposure for increased costs in the future should the supply tighten 
if interest rates rise rapidly  the company s reliance on these deposits could have an adverse impact on net interest income if the costs to retain those deposits rise faster than rates charged on interest earning assets 
effective january   upon implementation of sfas  the company s excess servicing receivable and purchased servicing rights were reclassified as a servicing asset for that portion of the receivables that did not exceed contractually specified servicing fees and interest only strips receivable for the portion which exceeds contractually specified servicing fees 
the amortized book value of the servicing asset was million at december  the interest only strips receivable are measured like available for sale investments in debt securities under sfas included in other assets december   are interest only strips receivable with an estimated market value of million 
this includes an unrealized gain of million 
capital resources at december   the company had shareholders equity of million as compared to million at december  the company s growth strategy is to expand its banking business  internally and through possible acquisitions 
such expansion is contingent on the retention of internally generated earnings  and the possible issuance of new equity or additional debt  as well as the satisfaction of other factors including obtaining regulatory approvals 
the company s strategy is to expand its banking business  through internal growth and acquisitions  both within its present service areas  particularly in the reno metropolitan market and adjacent areas  and the sacramento valley locations 
it also plans to increase the volume and geographic scope of its sba lending to leverage on its sba loan origination and servicing capabilities 
in connection with this objective  the company established loan production offices  during in buena park in southern california and in fresno  california and during in portland  oregon  denver  colorado and chattanooga  tennessee 
the buena park office was closed in effective june  the company acquired mercantile bank 
based in sacramento  mercantile was a business bank primarily servicing the commercial and real estate loan industry and had total assets of million 
loans and deposits acquired pursuant to the acquisition of mercantile totaled million and million 
under the terms of the transaction  shareholders of mercantile received total compensation of million on the acquisition date 
the compensation consisted of  shares of company common stock and million in cash 
goodwill and other intangible assets recorded upon the acquisition of mercantile totaled million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
on november   the company signed a definitive agreement to acquire the outstanding common stock of california community bancshares ccbc in a transaction valued at approximately million  based on the closing price of swb stock on november  ccbc  the parent of continental pacific bank  is headquartered in vacaville  california

ccbc had total assets of million at december  the merger  which is scheduled to close during the first half of  is subject to the approval of ccbc s and swb s shareholders and federal and state regulators  as well as certain other terms and conditions 
under the terms of the proposed transaction  shareholders of ccbc will receive shares of swb common stock at an exchange ratio to be determined by a formula based on the average of the closing prices of swb common stock during a defined day period prior to the effective date of the transaction 
for example  if the average price during the day period were  the closing price of swb stock on december   each share of ccbc stock would be exchanged for approximately shares of swb common stock 
this transaction is expected to be accounted for as a pooling of interests 
during june the company completed construction of a new regional facility in reno  nevada 
total costs incurred for the land and building at december  were million 
the company currently occupies approximately  square feet of this  square foot facility 
the remaining space is leased or to be leased until needed by the company for expansion 
at february  a total of  square feet had been leased out  with  square feet of leasable space remaining 
on july   the company sold its real property in carson city  nevada 
this property is being leased back on behalf of the company s carson city branch for an initial term of thirteen years at an annual rate of thousand for the first five years and increasing thereafter 
the gain on the sale was thousand which has been deferred and is being amortized as a reduction of future rental expense 
on february   the company sold to the public  of optional convertible subordinated debentures  convertible at the option of the holder at per share 
these debentures mature on february  and are redeemable on or after february  in whole or in part at the option of the company

these shares were created by the company to facilitate a shareholder protection rights plan 
during january of a dividend of rights was made to existing stockholders to acquire stock of the company 
this plan is designed to protect the company and its stockholders against abusive takeover attempts and tactics 
in essence  the rights plan would dilute the interests of an entity attempting to take control of the company if the attempt is not deemed by the board of directors to be in the best interests of all stockholders 
if the board of directors determines that an offer is in the best interests of the stockholders  the stock rights may be redeemed for nominal value  allowing the entity to acquire control of the company 
year many existing computer programs use only two digits to identify a year in the date datum field eg  for 
as a result  the company  like most other companies  will face a potentially serious information systems computer problem because many software applications and operational programs written in the past may not properly recognize calendar dates beginning in the year if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results by or at the year the company is in the process of communicating with customers that the company has significant lending relationships with and other third parties to determine their year compliance readiness and the extent to which the company is vulnerable to any third party year issues 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company  would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company began the process of identifying the changes required to its software and hardware in in consultation with software and hardware providers  a consulting firm and bank regulators 
while the company believes it is taking all appropriate steps to assure that its information systems are prepared for the year  it is dependent on vendor compliance to some extent 
the company is requiring its systems and software vendors to represent that the services and products provided are  or will be  year compliant  and contemplates a program of testing compliance to commence in the company estimates that its costs related to year compliance will be at least  and may be significantly more 
this cost is being funded through operating cash flows 
the year problem is pervasive and complex as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to consequently  no assurance can be given that year compliance can be achieved without costs and uncertainties that might affect future financial results or cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating results or future financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending and deposit taking activities 
to that end  management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure 
the company does not have any market risk sensitive instruments entered into for trading purposes 
management uses several different tools to monitor its interest rate risk 
one measure of exposure to interest rate risk is gap analysis 
a positive gap for a given period means that the amount of interest earning assets maturing or otherwise repricing within such period is greater than the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or otherwise repricing within the same period 
the company has a positive gap 
also  the company uses interest rate shock simulations to estimate the effect of certain hypothetical rate changes 
based upon the company s shock simulations net interest income is expected to rise with increasing rates and fall with declining rates 
the company s positive gap is the result the majority of its loans having floating rates and a significant portion of its investments having a maturity of one year or less  while a significant portion of its liabilities are non interest and low interest bearing accounts that are insensitive to rate changes 
management has taken several steps to reduce the positive gap of the company 
in  the company added fixed rate loans and increased the number of longer term investments 
also  in  the company entered into a fixed for floating swap agreement with a correspondent bank 
the swap agreement requires the company to pay a floating rate tied to prime and receive a fixed rate 
the company intends to continue increasing the number of fixed rate loans and investments held and the use of derivative products such as swaps 
also  in  the company securitized the unguaranteed portions of loans made under the small business administration s a program 
securitization is an effective asset liability management tool because the asset and liability cash flows and repricings are closely matched 
the company intends to continue using securitization as a source of funding its loans in the future 
the following table sets forth the distribution of repricing opportunities of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the interest rate sensitivity gap ie  interest rate sensitive assets less interest rate sensitive liabilities  the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap and the cumulative gap as a percentage of total interest earning assets  as of december  the table also sets forth the time periods during which interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities will mature or may reprice in accordance with their contractual terms 
the interest rate relationships between the repriceable assets and repriceable liabilities are not necessarily constant and may be affected by many factors  including the behavior of customers in response to changes in interest rates 
this table should  therefore  be used only as a guide as to the possible effect changes in interest rates might have on the net margins of the company dollars in thousands

includes loans which matured on or prior to december  at december   the company had million in assets and million in liabilities repricing within one year 
this means that million more in interest rate sensitive liabilities than interest rate sensitive assets will change to the then current rate changes occur due to the instruments being at a variable rate or because the maturity of the instrument requires its replacement at the then current rate 
interest income is likely to be affected to a greater extent than interest expense for any changes in interest rates during the immediately to twelve month periods 
if rates were to fall during this period  interest income would decline by a greater amount than interest expense and net income would be reduced 
conversely  if rates were to rise  the reverse would apply 
the following table sets forth the distribution of the expected maturities of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as well as the fair value of these instruments 
expected maturities are based on contractual payments adjusted for the estimated effect of prepayments 
loans have been assumed to prepay at an average rate of per year 
this rate is consistent with historical information on the company s sba loan portfolio 
with respect to other loans the company has not tracked its historical prepay speed  but for the purposes of this table has utilized an rate 
savings accounts and interest bearing transaction accounts  which have no stated maturity  are included in the one year or less maturity category dollars in thousands

savings deposits include interest bearing transaction accounts 
interest on tax exempt obligations has not been tax effected to include the related tax benefits in calculating the weighted average yield 
the company s million notional amount interest rate swap maturities in march  under this agreement the other party to the swap pays a fixed rate of and receives from the company the prime rate 
the swap had an estimated fair value of a negative thousand at december
