net revenues consist of license revenue  research and development fees and service revenue 
license revenue in fiscal year decreased  or  in comparison with the previous fiscal year 
greater non recurring license revenue in the previous fiscal year from the termination or restructuring of certain oem license agreements was the primary reason for this decline 
during fiscal year  the company recognized revenue upon the termination or restructuring of four oem license agreements 
at the time these four agreements were terminated or restructured  a non refundable prepaid royalty balance related to each agreement had been recorded as deferred revenue but was not yet fully amortized

revenues associated with source code license fees  one time payments  product terminations  and the termination or restructuring of license agreements are non recurring 
accordingly  revenues for all periods presented are not indicative of revenues to be recognized in future periods

the amount of such revenue can vary considerably among periods  depending upon the specific terms of the company s contracts with oem licensees and the relative level of development effort devoted towards projects on which research and development fees are charged 
the substantial increase during fiscal year in research and development fees resulted from higher reimbursement levels specified in the company s contracts with oem licensees  and from the fact that there was a greater number of projects in process for which such fees are charged

there can be no assurance that the company will meet the milestones required to earn such fees
