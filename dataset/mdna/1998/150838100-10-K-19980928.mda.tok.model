impact of year issue an issue exists for all companies that rely on computers as the year approaches 
the year problem is the result of the past practice in the computer industry of using two digits rather than four to identify the applicable year 
this practice will result in incorrect results when computers perform arithmetic operations  comparisons or data field sorting involving years later than the company s central computer system is year compliant and the company has purchased most of its computer software from third party vendors and is relying on those vendors to make their software year compliant 
the company does not  however  currently have any information concerning the year compliance status of its suppliers and customers 
in the event that year problems arise within the company or that its significant suppliers or customers do not successfully and timely achieve year compliance  the company believes it may have to seek less sophisticated and more time consuming methods to receive orders and payments for orders received  which could result in a temporary loss of revenue 
there can be no assurance that the company s suppliers or customers will be year compliant  which could adversely affect the company 
the company has incurred minimal costs associated with year compliance and anticipates incurring minimal costs in the future 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will not have to bear year costs and expense in the future
