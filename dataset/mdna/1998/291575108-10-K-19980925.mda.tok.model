fiscal as compared to fiscal general the railroad industry in north america has been undergoing a consolidation of class i rail carriers over the past several years 
two class i consolidations are currently in progress that will impact the future operations of the company s railroads 
these include the split up of consolidated rail corporation conrail by norfolk southern railroad ns and csx corporation csx  and the acquisition of illinois central railroad ic by the canadian national railway cn 
in july  csx and ns received formal written approval from the surface transportation board stb to divide up conrail s assets between the two class i railroads 
while the impact of the consolidation of these companies on future traffic patterns and the resultant effect on the company s railroad operations are uncertain at this time  the company believes that the consolidation may create additional rail business for the company s pennsylvania rail operations as a result of longer class i single line service on competitive routes and access to the canadian pacific railway through a commercial relationship and connection via ns from harrisburg to york  pennsylvania 
in february  cn announced its acquisition of ic  and in july filed a formal application with the stb seeking regulatory approval for the control and integration of ic s rail operations

s 
gulf coast in new orleans  with the joining of the railroads in chicago

based upon the sustained significant increase in taxable income in the current year  new business added to the company s railroad operations in the current year  and acquisitions completed during the current year  the company reduced the valuation allowance attributable to the net operating loss deferred tax assets in fiscal because its reassessment indicated that it appeared more likely than not that the benefits will be realized

year compliance issues the company has evaluated its risks with respect to year compliance issues and the impact on its information systems and operations  and has identified three significant risk areas 
these include third party software utilized by the company on its own information systems  outside service providers and value added networks  and information systems utilized by the company s primary connecting rail carriers 
the company has investigated the potential impact of the year with respect to each significant risk area identified  and has determined that all critical software either is year compliant  is in the process of being modified to accommodate the year  or is replaceable by alternative software options at a reasonable cost 
the company is reliant upon its third party vendors  outside service providers and value added networks  and connecting rail carriers to become year compliant for its successful transition into the new millennium 
since year compliance by these parties is outside of the company s control  there can be no assurance that the systems critical to the company s operations will be compliant by the year if any of these parties do not successfully achieve year compliance  the company s operations may be adversely affected 
the company has engaged the services of an outside consultant to prepare a year compliance plan  which has been substantially completed  and is currently in the process of implementing the plan for all other hardware and software systems which may be affected by the year the company does not anticipate that the cost of becoming year compliant will be material
