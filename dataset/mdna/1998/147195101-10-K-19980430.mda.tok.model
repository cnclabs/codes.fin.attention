impact of the year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
some of the company s computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  ship product or engage in any number of similar business activities 
based on a recent assessment  the company determined that it will need to modify or replace portions of its software so that its computer systems will properly handle dates beyond december  the company presently believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue can be mitigated 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or not timely completed  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company has initiated formal communications with all of its significant suppliers and large customers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issue 
there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company has determined that it has no exposure to contingencies related to the year issue for the products it has sold 
the company has initiated the implementation of an enterprise wide resource planning erp software system to link all of its core business systems throughout the company 
this project was the result of a normal business migration to improved and expanded software systems to increase the company s ability to improve its operational efficiency  reduce costs and enhance overall quality 
as part of this implementation  the company will also replace those software systems that will encounter the year issue 
the company plans to complete the erp project in the year and will complete those portions of the project that will address the year issue in the total remaining cost of the erp project is estimated at  and is being funded through operating cash flows and through leasing portions of the system 
of the project cost  approximately  will be capitalized 
the remaining  will be expensed or placed under operating leases 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company plans to complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates which were derived using numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modifications  plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes and similar uncertainties
