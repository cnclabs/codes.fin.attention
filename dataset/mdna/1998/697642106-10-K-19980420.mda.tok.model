that decrease was offset in part by an increase in interest expense of approximately related to higher outstanding balances on the revolving line of credit resulting from higher investments in basic inventory during the year as well as the funding of certain of the company s information systems initiatives

year ended february  compared to year ended january  sales as discussed in note q to the financial statements  the company closed forty stores at the end of fiscal in unprofitable or highly competitive markets which did not fit the company s niche market strategy 
consequently  the company experienced a planned decrease in total sales for fiscal of  or compared to fiscal due primarily to the reduced number of stores 
during fiscal the company opened eight new prototype stores  of which six are located in new markets and two were relocations  the company also closed two stores  resulting in a net increase in selling area during the fiscal year of approximately  square feet not including changes relating to the forty stores closed as of fiscal year end to a total of  square feet 
as of february   the company s store base included of the company s most recent store prototype  which represented of the company s total selling square feet 
comparable store sales during the week fiscal period decreased by  or from the week fiscal period 
comparable store sales on a week to week basis decreased by 
sales were affected primarily by slowed warehouse distributions to stores as a result of the implementation of a new warehouse inventory management system initiated in the first quarter of fiscal the slowed distributions caused a deterioration of merchandise in stock positions in most of the company s stores  resulting in lost sales 
while implementation of the warehouse system was largely completed by august  and in stock positions at the stores improved thereafter  sales remained below management expectations due to reduced customer traffic continuing in the third and fourth quarters 
comparable sales also were affected during much of the year by low margin clearance sales in fiscal which were not necessary at the same level in fiscal however  beginning late in the holiday shopping season and continuing through fiscal year end  sales improved as the company demonstrated to customers its improved in stock position in all product categories 
the company experienced substantial comparable store sales increases in fiscal in several merchandise categories  the most dramatic of which were in the pharmacy prescription  junior apparel  grocery and ready to wear areas

the company experienced comparable store sales decreases in several categories 
the largest dollar decreases on a comparable store basis were in the electronics  automotive  misses bottoms  men s shoes  electrical and appliance areas 
management believes that subtle adjustments made to the company s softlines strategy at the end of fiscal to meet customer demand for a deeper selection of basic apparel had a positive impact on sales and margins in softlines during fiscal gross profit gross profit dollars were affected by the reduced number of stores in operation during fiscal as compared to fiscal the company s merchandise gross profit as a percentage of sales improved to in fiscal from in fiscal however  this improvement was diluted by additional costs related to the implementation of the new warehouse inventory management system discussed above 
warehouse costs increased to  from  the previous year and increased as a percent of sales to from the previous year 
delivery costs decreased to  in fiscal from  the previous year and amounted to of sales in both years 
accordingly  gross profit decreased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal but  as a percentage of sales  increased to in fiscal from in fiscal selling  general and administrative expense decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expense decreased to from last year 
this reduction was largely attributable to reductions in store level expenses 
store payroll  controllable and occupancy expenses accounted for of the total decrease in selling  general and administrative expense and decreased by  and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expense also was positively impacted by a reduction in advertising costs which accounted for of the gross decrease in selling  general and administrative expense 
all of these areas of expense were impacted by the elimination of costs related to the forty stores which were closed as of the end of fiscal selling  general and administrative expense also was impacted by an decrease in corporate general and administrative costs which accounted for of the gross decreases in selling  general and administrative expense 
the major components of this decrease were decreases in the net costs of insurance  professional fees  management bonuses and related fringe benefits 
selling  general and administrative expense also was positively impacted by the elimination of amortization of goodwill and favorable leasehold interests resulting from the write off of these items in the fourth quarter of fiscal the decreases in selling  general and administrative expense were offset by a  reduction in other income which was attributable largely to one time gains realized in fiscal  primarily from the sale of idle transportation company assets 
interest expense increased marginally by or for fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in interest expense for fiscal was attributable primarily to higher usage of the revolving line of credit and to the outstanding promissory notes of the company which require quarterly compounding interest payments to be paid in kind 
these increases were largely offset by decreased interest related to lower average outstanding capitalized lease obligations in fiscal compared to fiscal income tax provision no income tax benefit on losses for fiscal were recorded since the company could not establish with a reasonable degree of certainty the potential utilization of certain tax loss carry forwards from prior year store closing charges 
the effective tax rate in fiscal was and was impacted by the non deductible amortization and write off of goodwill and the reserves recorded to offset the deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources the company s business is seasonal with first quarter sales february through april being lower than sales during the other three quarters  while fourth quarter sales november through january have represented approximately of the full year s retail sales in recent years and normally involve a greater proportion of higher margin sales 
the company has satisfied its seasonal liquidity requirements primarily through a combination of funds provided from operations and from a revolving credit facility 
funds provided by operating activities totaled  in fiscal  and funds used by operating activities totaled  in fiscal funds provided from operations totaled  in fiscal the positive change in cash flow from operating activities from fiscal to fiscal was primarily the result of improved operating results  a net decrease in inventory and increases in operating and tax liabilities 
the change in cash flow from operating activities from fiscal to fiscal was primarily the result of planned net increases in inventory and other operating assets and decreases in accounts payable and other operating liabilities 
these decreases in cash flow were offset in part by changes in deferred income taxes 
effective march   the term of pamida  inc s pamida committed loan and security agreement the agreement was extended to march and the maximum borrowing limit of the facility was increased to  from  which had been the limit throughout fiscal prior to march   borrowings under the agreement bore interest at a rate which was 
per annum greater than the applicable prime rate 
effective march   borrowings under the agreement bear interest at a rate which is tied to prime rate or the london interbank offered rate libor  generally at pamida s discretion 
the amounts pamida is permitted to borrow are determined by a formula based upon the amount of pamida s eligible inventory from time to time 
such borrowings are secured by security interests in all of the current assets including inventory of pamida and by liens on certain real estate interests and other property of pamida 
the company and two subsidiaries of pamida have guaranteed the payment and performance of pamida s obligations under the loan and security agreement and have pledged some or all of their respective assets  including the stock of pamida owned by the company  to secure such guarantees 
the agreement contains provisions imposing operating and financial restrictions on the company 
certain provisions of the agreement require the maintenance of specified amounts of tangible net worth as defined and working capital and the achievement of specified minimum amounts of cash flow as defined 
other restrictions in the agreement and those provided under the indenture relating to the senior subordinated notes will affect  among other things  the ability of pamida to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  repay indebtedness prior to its stated maturity  create liens  enter into leases  sell assets or engage in mergers or acquisitions  make capital expenditures and make investments 
these covenants currently have not had an impact on the company s ability to fully utilize the revolving credit facility 
however  certain of the covenants  such as those which restrict the ability of the company to incur indebtedness or encumber its property or which impose restrictions on or otherwise limit the company s ability to engage in sale lease back transactions  may at some future time prevent the company from pursuing its store expansion program at the rate that the company desires 
obligations under the agreement were  at february  and  at february  as noted above  this facility expires in march  and the company intends to refinance any outstanding balance by such date 
borrowings under the agreement are senior to the senior subordinated notes of the company 
the company had long term debt and obligations under capital leases of  at february  and  at february  the company s ability to satisfy scheduled principal and interest payments under such obligations in the ordinary course of business is dependent primarily upon the sufficiency of the company s operating cash flow 
at february   the company was in compliance with all covenants contained in its various financing agreements 
on december   the promissory notes of the company were amended effective as of december  to provide that  until the obligations of pamida and the company under certain of pamida s credit agreements had been repaid  the quarterly interest payments on the promissory notes of the company were to be paid in kind 
as discussed in note b to the financial statements  the company repaid all of the promissory notes with common stock of the company on november  as described in note b to the financial statements  the company reclassified all preferred stock into common stock effective november  accordingly  the company has no remaining obligations related to the preferred stock as of the end of fiscal pamida paid the company in fiscal under a tax sharing agreement to enable the company to pay quarterly dividends to its preferred stockholders 
during fiscal  the company received from pamida under a tax sharing agreement as a reimbursement for certain tax benefits derived by pamida 
such remittance  along with from the exercise of certain stock options  was used by the company to redeem subordinated promissory notes as described in note n to the financial statements  to repay intercompany balances totaling  and to pay quarterly dividends on preferred stock 
since the company conducts no operations of its own  prior to the november  reclassification of the preferred stock  the only cash requirement of the company related to preferred stock dividends in the aggregate annual amount of approximately  and pamida was expressly permitted under its existing credit facilities to pay dividends to the company to fund such preferred stock dividends 
however  the general corporation law of the state of delaware  under which the company and pamida are incorporated  allows a corporation to declare or pay a dividend only from its surplus or from the current or the prior year s earnings 
due to the retained deficit resulting primarily from the store closings and the write off of goodwill and other long lived assets recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company and pamida did not declare or pay any cash dividends in fiscal the company made capital expenditures of  in fiscal compared to  during fiscal the company also made expenditures of  and  in fiscal and  respectively  related to information systems software 
the company plans to open eight new stores in fiscal and will consider additional opportunities for new store locations as they arise 
capital expenditures and information systems software costs are expected to total approximately  in fiscal the company expects to fund these expenditures from cash flow from its operations 
the costs of buildings and land for new store locations are expected to be financed by operating or capital leases with unaffiliated landlords 
the company s expansion program also will require inventory of approximately  to  for each new market store  which the company expects to finance through trade credit  borrowings under the agreement and cash flow from operations 
the changes to the agreement  along with expected improvements in the company s cash flow from operations  should provide adequate resources to meet the company s near term liquidity requirements 
on a long term basis  the company s expansion will require continued investments in store locations  distribution and infrastructure enhancements and working capital 
the company expects to continue to finance some of these investments through leases from unaffiliated landlords  trade credit  borrowings under the agreement and cash flow from operations but ultimately will need to explore additional sources of funds which may include additional capital structure changes 
currently  it is not possible for the company to predict with any certainty either the timing or the availability of such additional financing 
year compliance the company has developed a comprehensive plan to mitigate the company s exposure to potential problems with its systems ability to properly process data beyond the calendar year  which is commonly referred to as year compliance 
the company has completed implementation of several new systems and is at various stages of implementation of others which replace legacy systems 
the company plans to complete installation of current releases or upgrades for all of these systems no later than july  to help ensure that these systems will be year compliant 
all of these systems have substantially improved functionality over the company s legacy systems which they replace and will  therefore  be capitalized 
failure to implement such releases or upgrades  or the failure of the vendors of the aforementioned software to have eliminated the potential year issues within the software  could materially and adversely affect the company s operations and financial results 
the cost of directly addressing year compliance for legacy systems which are not planned to be replaced by new systems is being charged to expense as incurred and is not expected to be material 
inflation the company uses the lifo method of inventory valuation in its financial statements  as a result  the cost of merchandise sold approximates current costs 
the company s rental expense is generally fixed and  except for small amounts of percentage rents and rentals adjusted by cost of living increases tied to the consumer price index or interest rates  has not been affected by inflation
