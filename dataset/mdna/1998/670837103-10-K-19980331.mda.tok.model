management s discussion and analysis 
overview percent change from prior year thousands except per share amounts operating revenues    earnings available for common stock    average shares outstanding    earnings per average common share dividends paid per share the following discussion and analysis presents factors which had a material effect on the operations and financial position of oge energy corp 
the company and its subsidiaries oklahoma gas and electric company og e  enogex inc and its subsidiaries enogex and origen inc 
and its subsidiaries origen during the last three years and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
trends and contingencies of a material nature are discussed to the extent known and considered relevant 
the company became the parent company of og e and og e s former subsidiary  enogex  on december   in a corporate reorganization whereby all common stock of og e was exchanged on a share for share basis for common stock of the company 
prior to december   the company had no operations and the financial results discussed herein for and essentially represent the consolidated statements of og e  and comparisons to prior year results represent comparisons to the consolidated results of og e 
under this corporate structure  the company serves as the parent holding company to og e  enogex  origen and any other companies that may be formed within the organization in the future 
this holding company structure is intended to provide greater flexibility  allowing the company to take advantage of opportunities in an increasingly competitive business environment and to clearly separate the company s electric utility business from its non utility businesses 
because og e is the company s principal subsidiary  the company s financial results and condition are substantially dependent at this time on the financial results and condition of og e 
earnings for decreased percent from per share in to per share in the decrease is primarily the result of the million annual reduction in og e s electric rates that became effective in march  slightly lower earnings by enogex and a loss by origen  the company s new non regulated subsidiary  during its first year of operation 
the decrease in earnings was partially offset by the generation efficiency performance rider gep rider  continued customer growth in the og e service area and lower interest costs 
the gep rider allows og e to retain part of the fuel savings achieved through cost efficiencies and is discussed in more detail below 
the increase from per share to per share resulted primarily from customer growth in the og e service area  lower interest costs and increased earnings by enogex 
the dividend payout ratio expressed as a percentage of earnings available for common remained at percent in the company s long term goal is to achieve a dividend payout ratio of percent based on long term earnings expectations 
the company s regulated utility business has been and will continue to be affected by competitive changes to the utility industry 
significant changes already have occurred in the wholesale electric markets at the federal level 
in oklahoma  legislation was passed in to provide for the orderly restructuring of the electric industry with the goal to provide retail customers with the ability to choose their generation suppliers by june  the arkansas public service commission apsc recently initiated proceedings to consider the implementation of a competitive retail market in arkansas 
these developments are described in more detail below under regulation  competition 
in  the company decided upon an enterprise wide software future for its businesses 
enterprise software is a corporate software system designed to handle most of the company s information processing needs and to improve work processes throughout the company 
the enterprise software system was successfully implemented throughout the company on january  and is expected to significantly enhance the company s abilities in the more competitive years ahead 
in may  enogex acquired an percent interest in the nustar joint venture for approximately million 
the assets of the joint venture include a two thirds interest in a gas processing plant  a percent interest in a gas bypass plant  approximately miles of natural gas liquid pipeline and approximately miles of related gas gathering facilities in west texas 
in january  the company  through various subsidiaries  agreed to acquire interests in two natural gas pipelines  noark pipeline systems  lp  and ozark pipeline 
in january  the company also agreed to acquire an existing cogeneration facility in pryor  oklahoma 
these transactions  which are described in detail below under future capital requirements  are contingent on various regulatory approvals and  assuming such approvals are obtained  are expected to enhance the company s results in the years ahead 
except for the historical statements contained herein  the matters discussed in the following discussion and analysis  are forward looking statements that are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
such forward looking statements are intended to be identified in this document by the words anticipate  estimate  objective  possible  potential and similar expressions 
actual results may vary materially 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to general economic conditions  including their impact on capital expenditures  business conditions in the energy industry  competitive factors  unusual weather  regulatory decisions  and the other risk factors listed in the reports filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission 
results of operations revenues percent change from prior year thousands sales of electricity to og e customers    sales of electricity to other utilities    enogex    origen total operating revenues    system kilowatt hour sales    kilowatt hour sales to other utilities    total kilowatt hour sales    in  approximately percent of the company s revenues consisted of regulated sales of electricity as a public utility  while the remaining percent was provided by the non utility operations of enogex and origen 
revenues from sales of electricity are somewhat seasonal  with a large portion of the company s annual electric revenues occurring during the summer months when the electricity needs of its customers increase 
enogex s primary operations consist of transporting natural gas through its intra state pipeline to various customers including og e  buying and selling natural gas to third parties gas marketing  selling natural gas liquids extracted by its natural gas processing plants and investing in natural gas exploration and production activities 
origen s primary operations consist of geothermal systems design and engineering and the development of new products 
actions of the regulatory commissions that set og e s electric rates will continue to affect the company s financial results 
the commissions also have the authority to examine the appropriateness of og e s recovery from its customers of fuel costs  which include the transportation fees that og e pays enogex for transporting natural gas to og e s generating units 
see regulation  competition and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of the oklahoma corporation commission occ february   rate order on these transportation fees 
operating revenues increased million or percent during  primarily due to a significant increase in revenue from enogex 
in  enogex revenues increased million or percent  primarily as a result of significant increases in the volume of natural gas sold through its gas marketing activities million  and of natural gas liquids processed and sold million  mainly due to the acquisition of nustar joint venture in may  with a modest increase in prices for natural gas 
the increased revenues from enogex were partially offset by decreased revenues at og e 
decreased revenues at og e were primarily attributable to the rate reduction in march  and milder weather in the first and second quarters of  partially offset by continued customer growth  the effect of the gep rider and warmer weather in the third quarter of on february   the occ issued an order the order that  among other things  effectively lowered og e s rates to its oklahoma retail customers by million annually based on a test year ended december  
of the million rate reduction  approximately million became effective on march   and the remaining million became effective march  this million rate reduction is in addition to the million rate reduction that was effective january  and that related to og e s workforce reduction in the order also directed og e to transition to competitive bidding of its gas transportation requirements  currently met by enogex  no later than april   and set annual compensation for the transportation services provided by enogex to og e at million until competitively bid gas transportation begins 
on june   og e filed documents with the occ relating to the gep rider  pursuant to the order 
the gep rider is designed so that when og e s average annual cost of fuel per kwh is less than percent of the average non nuclear fuel cost per kwh of certain other investor owned utilities in the region  og e is allowed to collect  through the gep rider  one third of the amount by which og e s average annual cost of fuel is less than percent of the average of the other specified utilities 
if og e s fuel cost exceeds percent of the stated average  og e will not be allowed to recover one third of the fuel costs above that amount from oklahoma customers 
the fuel cost information used to calculate the gep rider is based on fuel cost data submitted by each of the utilities in their form no 
annual report filed with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
the gep rider is revised effective july of each year to reflect any changes in the relative annual cost of fuel reported for the preceding calendar year 
for  the gep rider increased revenues by approximately million  or approximately per share 
the current gep rider is estimated to positively impact revenue by million  or approximately per share during the months ending june during  operating revenues increased million or percent  primarily due to continued growth in kilowatt hour sales to og e customers system sales million and a significant increase in revenue from enogex businesses 
in  enogex revenues increased percent 
this increase was primarily attributable to increased gas marketing sales million  increased petroleum product sales million  increased oil and gas development and production activities million and increased third party gas transportation services million 
expenses and other items percent change from prior year dollars in thousands fuel    purchased power    gas purchased for resale enogex    other operation and maintenance    depreciation and amortization    taxes    total operating expenses    total operating expenses increased million or percent in  primarily due to increases at enogex in quantities and prices of gas purchased for resale and other operation and maintenance costs 
enogex s gas purchased for resale pursuant to its gas marketing operations increased million or percent for compared to an increase of million or percent for the increase was due to a significant increase in sales volumes  bbtu or percent and a modest increase in purchase prices of approximately percent  while the increase resulted from increased sales volumes and significantly higher purchase prices 
og e s generating capability is evenly divided between coal and natural gas and provides for flexibility to use either fuel to the best economic advantage for og e and its customers 
in  despite a slight increase in kwh sales  fuel costs decreased million or percent primarily due to an increase in the percentage of coal fired generation relative to total generation 
during  fuel costs increased million or percent because of increased generation of electricity resulting from continued customer growth and favorable weather conditions in the electric service area 
other operation and maintenance expenses increased million in primarily because of increased costs associated with expansion activities at enogex and origen million 
these increases were partially offset by the higher costs associated with the development of the enterprise wide software in and the completion in february of the amortization of the million regulatory asset established in connection with og e s workforce reduction 
other operation and maintenance increased million in primarily due to the new enterprise wide software information processing system million  increased pension expense million  and increased pipeline operating and maintenance associated with increased gas gathering and sales by enogex million 
in  taxes had a net decrease of million or percent primarily due to slightly lower pre tax income and normally occurring temporary differences 
income taxes increased in primarily due to a decrease in tax credits earned and higher pre tax earnings 
purchased power costs were million in  remaining relatively constant compared to the million in purchased power costs increased million or percent in primarily due to the availability of larger quantities of economically priced energy from other utilities 
as required by the public utility regulatory policy act purpa  og e is currently purchasing power from qualified cogeneration facilities 
as discussed below  og e recently took action to restructure one of its cogeneration contracts 
see related discussion of purchased power in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
variances in the actual cost of fuel used in electric generation and certain purchased power costs  as compared to that component in cost of service for ratemaking  are passed through to og e s electric customers through automatic fuel adjustment clauses 
the automatic fuel adjustment clauses are subject to periodic review by the occ  the apsc and the ferc 
the occ  the apsc and the ferc have authority to review the appropriateness of gas transportation charges or other fees og e pays enogex  which og e seeks to recover through the fuel adjustment clause or other tariffs 
in addition to the february   occ order  the apsc issued an order in july requiring  among other things  a million refund  and the occ issued an order in february requiring  among other things  a million refund relating to the fees og e paid enogex 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the july and february orders 
og e has initiated numerous other ongoing programs that have helped reduce the cost of generating electricity over the last several years 
these programs include utilizing a natural gas storage facility  spot market purchases of coal  renegotiated contracts for coal  gas  railcar maintenance and coal transportation  and a heat rate awareness program to produce kilowatt hours with less fuel 
reducing fuel costs helps og e remain competitive  which in turn helps og e s electric customers remain competitive in a global economy 
the increases in depreciation and amortization for and reflect higher levels of depreciable plant 
the decrease in interest expense for was attributable to og e retiring million of percent first mortgage bonds in january  the successful refinancing of million of short term and long term debt by og e and enogex in  and a lower average daily balance in short term debt 
the decrease in interest expense for was primarily attributable to the successful refinancing of approximately million of short term and long term debt in liquidity and capital resources the primary capital requirements for and as estimated for through are as follows dollars in millions electric utility construction expenditures including afudc non utility construction expenditures and pending acquisitions maturities of long term debt and sinking fund requirements total the company s primary needs for capital are related to construction of new facilities to meet anticipated demand for utility service  to replace or expand existing facilities in both its electric and non utility businesses  to expand its non utility businesses and to some extent  for satisfying maturing debt and sinking fund obligations 
the company generally meets its cash needs through a combination of internally generated funds  short term borrowings and permanent financing 
capital requirements and financing activities capital requirements were million in approximately million of the capital requirements were to comply with environmental regulations 
this compares to capital requirements of million in  of which million was to comply with environmental regulations 
during  the company s primary source of capital was internally generated funds from operating cash flows 
operating cash flow remained strong in as internally generated funds and medium term notes issued by enogex provided financing for all of the company s capital expenditures 
variations in accounts receivable and accounts payable are not generally significant indicators of the company s liquidity  as such variations are primarily attributable to fluctuations in weather in og e s service territory  which has a direct effect on sales of electricity 
short term borrowings were used during to meet temporary cash requirements 
at december   the company had outstanding short term borrowings of million 
in march  the company made a million capital contribution to enogex reflecting the company s commitment to maintaining enogex s strong credit rating and financial health 
in april  the company made a million initial capital contribution to origen 
in july  og e issued million of long term debt with million at percent due july   and million at percent due july  the proceeds from the sale of this new debt were applied to the redemption on august   of million principal amount of og e s percent first mortgage bonds due january   million principal amount of og e s percent first mortgage bonds due august   and million principal amount of og e s percent first mortgage bonds due december   all at the stated principal amount  plus the applicable redemption premiums and accrued interest to the redemption date 
in july  og e also refinanced its obligations with respect to million of percent pollution control revenue bonds due march   through the issuance of a new series due june   and bearing interest at a variable rate 
the annualized interest rate on these bonds from their date of issuance through december   was approximately percent 
effective march   enogex disposed of its percent interest in centoma gas systems  inc for million  which approximated the net book value of enogex s share of centoma s assets at december  enogex purchased its interest in centoma in for approximately million 
in addition  during the third quarter of  enogex recognized a million pre tax gain on the sale of underutilized assets 
as discussed previously  in may  enogex acquired an percent interest in the nustar joint venture for approximately million 
enogex financed this acquisition with borrowings from the company and in july  issued million of medium term notes at percent  due july   to repay the amounts borrowed from the company 
in february  og e filed a registration statement for up to million of grantor trust preferred securities 
assuming favorable market conditions  og e may issue all or part of the million of grantor trust preferred stock 
in january  all outstanding shares of og e s cumulative preferred stock were redeemed 
in february  og e filed a registration statement for up to million of senior notes 
assuming favorable market conditions  og e may issue all or part of these senior notes to refinance first mortgage bonds 
future capital requirements the company s construction program for the next several years does not include additional base load generating units 
rather  to meet the increased electricity needs of og e s electric utility customers during the balance of the century  og e will concentrate on maintaining the reliability  increasing the utilization of existing capacity and increasing demand side management efforts 
approximately 
million of the company s construction expenditures budgeted for are to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
future financing requirements may be dependent  to varying degrees  upon numerous factors such as general economic conditions  abnormal weather  load growth  acquisitions of other businesses  inflation  changes in environmental laws or regulations  rate increases or decreases allowed by regulatory agencies  new legislation and market entry of competing electric power generators 
in january  enogex  through a newly formed subsidiary  enogex arkansas pipeline corp 
eapc agreed to acquire interests in two natural gas pipelines  noark pipeline system  lp noark and ozark pipeline ozark  for approximately million and million  respectively 
the noark line is a mile intra state pipeline system that extends from near fort chafee  arkansas to near paragould  arkansas 
current throughput capacity on the noark line is approximately million cubic feet per day 
the ozark line is a mile interstate pipeline system that begins near mcalester  oklahoma and terminates near searcy  arkansas 
current throughput capacity on the ozark line is approximately million cubic feet per day 
the transactions are subject to certain regulatory approvals  including that of the ferc 
following regulatory approvals  eapc will contribute ozark to the noark partnership and the two pipelines will be integrated into a single  interstate transmission system at an estimated additional cost of million 
after the integration  which is to be funded by eapc  eapc will own a percent interest in the noark partnership and southwestern energy pipeline co 
will retain its percent interest in the partnership 
if the necessary regulatory approvals are obtained  enogex expects to fund these acquisitions through the issuance of medium term notes 
in january  og e filed an application with the occ seeking approval to revise an existing cogeneration contract with mid continent power company mcpc  a cogeneration plant near pryor  oklahoma 
under the purpa  og e was obligated to enter into the original contract  which was approved by the occ in  and which required og e to purchase megawatts of peaking capacity from the plant for years beginning in whether the capacity was needed or not 
as part of this transaction  the company agreed to purchase the stock of oklahoma loan acquisition corporation  the company that owns the mcpc plant  for approximately million 
completion of the transaction is subject to receipt of numerous regulatory approvals in addition to the occ  including the ferc and the apsc 
assuming the transaction is approved by the necessary regulatory agencies and the transaction is completed  the term of the existing cogeneration contract will be reduced by four and one half years  which should reduce the amounts to be paid by og e  and should provide savings for its oklahoma customers  of approximately million as compared to the existing cogeneration contract 
funding for the million purchase price is expected to be provided by internally generated funds and short term borrowings 
future sources of financing management expects that internally generated funds will be adequate over the next three years to meet anticipated construction expenditures  while maturities of long term debt will require permanent financing  the amount and type dependent on market conditions at the time 
short term borrowings will continue to be used to meet temporary cash requirements 
the company has the necessary regulatory approvals to incur up to million in short term borrowings at any one time 
the company has in place a line of credit for up to million which expires december  the company continues to evaluate opportunities to enhance shareowner returns and achieve long term financial objectives through acquisitions of non utility businesses 
permanent financing could be required for such acquisitions 
the year issue many computer systems and applications currently use two digit date fields to designate a year 
as the year approaches  date sensitive systems will recognize the year as  or not at all 
this inability to recognize or properly treat the year may cause systems  including those of the company  its customers and suppliers to process critical financial and operational information incorrectly if they are not year compliant 
the company is aggressively addressing the century date change issues 
this is reflected by the january   implementation throughout the company of the enterprise wide software system which is year compliant 
as a result of the enterprise wide software installation  the company was able to significantly reduce the potential risks of its older computer systems  because many programs were replaced by the new software which is year compliant 
as part of the company s lease agreement for personal computers  all new personal computers are being issued with operating systems that are year compliant 
all existing personal computers will be upgraded with year compliant operating systems before the turn of the century 
in addition  the company has formed a multifunctional team of experienced and knowledgeable company members from each business unit to review and test the operational systems in an effort to further eliminate any potential problems should they exist 
year compliance may also adversely affect the operations and financial performance of the company indirectly by causing complications at the company s suppliers and customers 
the company intends to determine the status of its significant customers and suppliers in becoming year compliant 
there can be no assurance that the company s operations will not be adversely affected by year problems of its customers and suppliers 
at this time  the company is currently unable to anticipate the magnitude of the operational or financial impact on the company of year issues with its suppliers and customers 
other than costs incurred to implement the enterprise wide software system and the replacement of personal computers  both of which were part of the normal budgeting process and would have occurred regardless of the year issues  the company has not incurred any incremental costs associated with year at this time  the company currently anticipates incurring less than million for future year compliance expenses 
anticipated spending for any such modifications will be expensed as incurred and is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
it is the company s goal to minimize the impact the turn of the century date change will have for its shareowners  customers and employees 
contingencies the company through its subsidiaries is defending various claims and legal actions  including environmental actions  which are common to its operations 
as to environmental matters  og e has been designated as a potentially responsible party prp with respect to two waste disposal sites to which og e sent materials 
remediation of one of these sites has been completed 
og e s total waste disposed at the remaining site is minimal and on february   the company elected to participate in the de minimis settlement offered by the environmental protection agency epa  which is being contested by one party 
this limits the company s financial obligation in addition to removing any participation in the site remedy 
while it is not possible to determine the precise outcome of these matters  in the opinion of management  og e s ultimate liability for these sites will not be material 
the company has contracted for low sulfur coal to comply with the sulfur dioxide limitations of the clean air act amendments of caaa 
og e also has completed installation and certification of all required continuous emissions monitors at each of its generating units 
phase ii sulfur dioxide emission requirements will affect og e beginning in the year og e believes it can meet these sulfur dioxide limits without additional capital expenditures 
with respect to nitrogen oxide limits  og e is meeting the current emission standards and has exercised its option to extend the effective date of the further reductions from to og e is continuing to monitor regulatory proposals including nitrogen oxide regulations proposed by the epa in october these regulations address long range ozone transport from midwest emissions sources that allegedly contribute to ozone problems in the northeast 
as proposed  such regulations would not apply to og e  but if these or similar regulations were to be adopted and applied to og e  og e could be required to incur significant capital expenditures and significantly increased operation and maintenance costs 
the oklahoma department of environmental quality s caaa title v air permitting program was approved by the epa in march by march of  og e had submitted comprehensive site air permit applications for all of its major source generating stations 
air permit fees for generating stations were approximately 
million in and are estimated to be approximately 
million in regulation  competition as previously reported  oklahoma enacted in april the electric restructuring act of the act 
if implemented as proposed  the act will significantly affect og e s future operations 
the purpose of the act  as set forth therein  is generally to restructure the electric utility industry to provide for more competition and  in particular  to provide for the orderly restructuring of the electric utility industry in the state of oklahoma in order to allow customers to choose their electricity suppliers while maintaining the safety and reliability of the electric system in the state 
the act directs the occ to undertake a study of all relevant issues relating to restructuring the electric utility industry in oklahoma and to develop a proposed electric utility framework for oklahoma under the direction of the joint electric utility task force  composed of seven members from the oklahoma senate and seven members from the oklahoma house of representatives 
the occ study is to be delivered in four parts 
the first part of the study  which was delivered february   addressed operational issues 
the second part of the study  which is due december   is to address technical issues  such as reliability  safety  unbundling of generation  transmission and distribution services  transition issues and market power 
the third part of the study is due december   and is to address financial issues  including rates  charges  access fees  transition costs and stranded costs 
the final part of the study is due august   and is to cover consumer issues  such as the obligation to serve  service territories  consumer choices  competition and consumer safeguards 
the act similarly directs the oklahoma tax commission to study and submit a report to the joint task force by december   regarding the impact of the restructuring of the electric utility industry on state tax revenues and all other facets of the current utility tax structure on the state and all political subdivisions of the state 
neither the oklahoma tax commission nor the occ is authorized to issue any rules on such matters without the approval of the oklahoma legislature 
other provisions of the act i authorize the joint task force to retain consultants to study  among other things  the creation of an independent system operator  ii prohibit customer switching prior to july   except by mutual consent  and iii prohibit municipalities that do not become subject to the act  from selling power outside their municipal limits  except from lines owned on april  a new bill was introduced in the state senate in the legislative session and was passed by a state senate committee in february this bill  if adopted  would modify the act by i directing the joint task force  instead of the occ  to conduct the required studies and ii accelerating the deadlines for completion of such studies to october  the company intends to actively participate in the restructuring of the electric utility industry in oklahoma and to remain a competitive supplier of electricity 
however  due to the early stages of the process  the company cannot predict the impact that the restructuring will have on its operations in the future 
in december  the apsc established four generic proceedings to consider the implementation of a competitive retail electric market in the state of arkansas 
among the topics to be considered are competitive retail generation  market structure  market power  taxation  recovery and mitigation of stranded costs  service and reliability  low income assistance  independent system operators and transition issues 
the company intends to participate actively in these proceedings 
on february   the occ issued an order  among other things  directing og e to transition to competitive bidding for its gas transportation requirements  currently met by enogex  no later than april  this order also set annual compensation for the transportation services provided by enogex to og e at million until competitively bid gas transportation begins 
in  approximately million or percent of enogex s revenues were attributable to transporting gas for og e 
other pipelines seeking to compete with enogex for og e s business will likely have to pay a fee to enogex for transporting gas on enogex s system or incur capital expenditures to develop the necessary infrastructure to connect with og e s gas fired generating stations 
nevertheless  a potential outcome of the competitive bidding process is that the revenues of enogex derived from transporting gas for og e may be significantly less after april  the occ recently adopted rules that are designed to make the gas utility business in oklahoma more competitive 
these rules do not impact the electric industry 
yet  if implemented  the rules are expected to offer increased opportunities to enogex s pipeline and related businesses 
in october  the national energy policy act of energy act was enacted 
among many other provisions  the energy act is designed to promote competition in the development of wholesale power generation in the electric utility industry 
it exempts a new class of independent power producers from regulation under the public utility holding company act of and allows the ferc to order wholesale wheeling by public utilities to provide utility and non utility generators access to public utility transmission facilities 
in april  the ferc issued two final rules  orders and  which may have a significant impact on wholesale markets 
order  which was preceded by a notice of proposed rulemaking referred to as the mega nopr  sets forth rules on non discriminatory open access transmission service to promote wholesale competition 
order  which was effective on july   requires utilities and other transmission users to abide by comparable terms  conditions and pricing in transmitting power 
order  which had its effective date extended to january   requires public utilities to implement standards of conduct and an open access same time information system oasis  formerly known as real time information networks 
these rules require transmission personnel to provide the same information about the transmission system to all transmission customers using the oasis 
og e is complying with these new rules from the ferc 
another impact of complying with ferc s order is a requirement for utilities to offer a transmission tariff that includes network transmission service nts to transmission customers 
nts allows transmission service customers to fully integrate load and resources on an instantaneous basis  in a manner similar to how og e has historically integrated its load and resources 
under nts  og e and participating customers share the total annual transmission cost for their combined joint use systems  net of related transmission revenues  based upon each company s share of the total system load 
management expects minimal annual expenses as a result of orders and as discussed previously  oklahoma enacted legislation that will restructure the electric utility industry in oklahoma by july  assuming that all the conditions in the legislation are met 
this legislation would deregulate og e s electric generation assets and the continued use of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  with respect to the related regulatory assets may no longer be appropriate 
this may result in either full recovery of generation related regulatory assets net of related regulatory liabilities or a non cash  pre tax write off as an extraordinary charge of up to million  depending on the transition mechanisms developed by the legislature for the recovery of all or a portion of these net regulatory assets 
the enacted oklahoma legislation does not affect og e s electric transmission and distribution assets and the company believes that the continued use of sfas no 
with respect to the related regulatory assets is appropriate 
however  if utility regulators in oklahoma and arkansas were to adopt regulatory methodologies in the future that are not based on cost of service  the continued use of sfas no 
with respect to the regulatory assets related to the electric transmission and distribution assets may no longer be appropriate 
based on a current evaluation of the various factors and conditions that are expected to impact future cost recovery  management believes that its regulatory assets  including those related to generation  are probable of future recovery 
on february   the apsc staff filed a motion for a show cause order to review og e s electric rates in the state of arkansas 
the staff is recommending a million annual rate reduction based on a test year ended december  and that og e file a cost of service study within days 
og e is in the process of evaluating the application 
besides the existing contingencies described above  and those described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company s ability to fund its future operational needs and to finance its construction program is dependent upon numerous other factors beyond its control  such as general economic conditions  abnormal weather  load growth  inflation  new environmental laws or regulations  and the cost and availability of external financing
