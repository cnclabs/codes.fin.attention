liquidity and capital resources at december   the registrant s current liabilities exceeded current assets by approximately million 
this shortfall in working capital results from financing the purchase of long term assets utilizing short term borrowings and from the classification of current mortgage obligations without the benefit of a corresponding current asset for such properties 
on january   the registrant sold its antenna business for million in cash  resulting in a pretax gain of approximately million or 
per share in the first quarter of substantially all of the cash proceeds of this transaction are available for general corporate purposes 
additionally  effective september   the registrant amended its january  credit agreement with two banks to provide for both a million term loan term loan and a million revolving credit facility revolver and converted million of amounts outstanding under the revolver to borrowings under the term loan 
under the terms of the credit agreement  the registrant will be provided with eligibility based upon the sum of i of the aggregate annualized and normalized year to date net operating income of eligible properties  as defined  capitalized at and ii the lesser of million or the sum of of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventory  as defined 
eligibility is also limited by amounts outstanding under the term loan 
at december  eligibility under the revolver was million  based upon the above terms 
the credit agreement contains certain financial and restrictive covenants  including minimum consolidated equity  interest coverage  debt service coverage and capital expenditures other then for real estate 
the credit agreement also contains provisions which allow the lenders to perfect a security interest in certain operating and real estate assets in the event of a default  as defined under the terms of the credit agreement 
borrowings under the revolver  at the registrant s option  bear interest at the bank s prime lending rate prime or at the london interbank offered rate libor plus while borrowings under the term loan bear interest at day libor plus 
the term loan is payable in quarterly principal installments of  with a final payment on september  the revolver expires on january  at december   approximately million was outstanding under this facility  which was repaid on january  the registrant was in compliance with all covenants 
also  effective september   the registrant entered into an interest rate swap agreement to effectively convert its floating rate term loan to a fixed rate basis  thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future expense 
under the swap agreement  the registrant agreed to exchange with the counterparty a commercial bank the difference between the fixed and floating rate interest amounts 
the differential to be paid or received on the interest rate swap is recognized over the term of the agreement as an adjustment to interest expense 
the fair value of the swap agreement is not recognized in the financial statements 
at december  approximately million was available to be borrowed under the revolver 
management is confident that with the available cash resources discussed above and cash generated by operations  all obligations will be satisfied as they become due 
the registrant has undertaken the completion of environmental studies and remedial action at metex two new jersey facilities and has filed an action against certain insurance carriers seeking recovery of costs incurred and to be incurred in these matters 
based upon the advice of counsel  management believes such recovery is probable and therefore should not have a material effect on the liquidity or capital resources of the registrant 
however  the ultimate outcome of litigation cannot be predicted 
to date settlements have been reached with several carriers in this matter 
at december  and a total of million in anticipated insurance recoveries is recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  and is included in other assets 
additionally  in the company received approximately million of insurance proceeds 
the remaining balance of million at december  from a total of million is in dispute with the registrant s insurance carriers as more fully discussed in item legal proceedings and note to consolidated financial statements contingencies 
management believes that recoveries in excess of the amounts reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are available under the insurance policies but have not been recorded 
there can be no assurance  however  that the registrant will prevail in its efforts to obtain amounts at or in excess of the estimated recoveries 
the cash needs of the registrant have been satisfied from funds generated by current operations and additional borrowings 
it is expected that future operational cash needs will also be satisfied from ongoing operations  additional borrowings on the revolver and the proceeds from the sale of the antenna business 
the primary source of capital to fund additional real estate acquisitions and to make additional high yield mortgage loans will come from the sale  financing and refinancing of the registrant s properties and from third party mortgages and purchase money notes obtained in connection with specific acquisitions 
in addition to the acquisition of properties for consideration consisting of cash and mortgage financing proceeds  the registrant may acquire real properties in exchange for the issuance of the registrant s equity securities 
the registrant may also finance acquisitions of other companies in the future with borrowings from institutional lenders and or the public or private offerings of debt or equity securities 
funds of the registrant in excess of that needed for working capital  purchasing real estate and arranging financing for real estate acquisitions are invested by the registrant in corporate equity securities  other financial instruments  certificates of deposit and government securities 
business trends total revenues of the registrant decreased approximately million from levels to million 
the reduction in revenues is attributable to revenue reductions in the engineered products segment as real estate operations posted an increase in revenues 
income from continuing operations increased to million in from million in principally due to an increase in operating profit of the registrant s real estate operations and a reduction in general corporate expenses  partially offset by reduced operating profit in the engineered products segment resulting from the reduction in revenues  as well as a reduction in other income  net 
the results of the registrant s real estate operations reflect an increase in operating profit of million on a revenue increase of only  continuing lease renewals and mortgage amortization will continue to have a positive effect upon the revenues and operating profit of this segment 
sales in the registrant s engineered products segment decreased in from record levels 
these reductions are principally due to continued price competition and declining worldwide automotive sales 
sales in are anticipated to approximate levels due to increased competition in a number of markets for knitted wire product sales 
management continues to invest in new product development and in new markets for its products and believes there is future opportunity for growth in this segment 
year conversion the registrant currently believes that its essential processes  systems and business functions will be ready for the millennium transition and is taking the necessary steps to accomplish this objective 
the year issue is not anticipated to have a material impact on the registrant s results of operations  financial position or its cash flows
