recent developments on march   the company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the forefront group  inc  a houston based provider of high quality  cost effective  computer based training products and network utilities for technical professionals forefront 
in the merger  each share of forefront common stock will be exchanged for adss  and the company will assume outstanding forefront stock options  warrants and other rights to acquire forefront common stock 
as a result of the merger  the company will issue approximately million adss and assume options  warrants and other rights that may be converted into up to approximately million adss 
the transaction is intended to be tax free to shareholders and is intended to be accounted for as a pooling of interests 
consummation of the transaction is subject to expiration or termination of the applicable hart scott rodino waiting period  approval of the merger by forefront stockholders and other customary closing conditions 
the merger is expected to be completed during the second quarter of consummation of the transaction is subject to a number of risk factors  including those discussed below and under additional risk factors that could affect operating results 
the successful combination of cbt group and forefront  including the successful operation of forefront as an autonomous subsidiary of cbt group  will require substantial effort from each company 
the diversion of the attention of management and any difficulties encountered in the transition process could have an adverse impact on cbt group s ability to realize the full benefits of the merger 
the successful combination of the two companies will also require coordination of their research and development and sales and marketing efforts 
in addition  the process of combining the two organizations could cause the interruption of  or loss of momentum in  forefront s activities 
there can be no assurance that cbt group will be able to retain forefront s key management  technical  sales and customer support personnel  or that it will realize any of the anticipated benefits of the merger 
certain of forefront s existing customers or strategic partners may view themselves as competitors of cbt group s  and therefore determine that the merger is competitively disadvantageous to them 
as a consequence  forefront s relationships with these customers or strategic partners could be adversely affected by the merger  which could adversely affect the ability of cbt group to continue relationships with such customers after the merger 
on march   the company effected a two for one split of its issued and outstanding adss whereby each issued and outstanding ads is now represented by one fourth of one ordinary share and each issued and outstanding ordinary share that is deposited with the bank of new york  as depositary  is represented by four adss

as part of the agreement  cbt group acquired a ownership interest in street technologies and street technologies agreed that its license will be exclusive to cbt group within a defined group of companies 
in december  cbt group exchanged its ownership interest in street technologies and  in cash  for a perpetual license of street technologies deployment tools 
industry background business organizations continue to be dependent upon computer systems in order to remain competitive in their markets 
this trend has resulted in significant growth in it education and training 
according to international data corporation idc  the worldwide and us markets for it education and training were approximately billion and billion  respectively  compared to billion and billion  respectively  in according to idc  the factors driving these markets include i the shift by organizations from legacy mainframe systems to new client server technologies  driving corporate information services is groups to seek additional it education and training  ii business requirements that is staff be certified in certain technologies in order to assure performance and productivity  iii corporate downsizing  resulting in increased training requirements for employees who perform multiple job tasks that require knowledge of varied software applications and technologies  iv the proliferation of computers and networks throughout all levels of organizations  increasing the number of employees who need training in client server and internet intranet technologies  and v the continuous introduction and evolution of client server and internet intranet technologies  contributing to the need for continuing education 
traditionally  organizations have primarily fulfilled their requirements for it education and training through instructor led training from external vendors or internal training departments 
instructor led training  however  has a number of limitations 
instructor led training typically requires employees to leave their desks for prolonged periods  often to attend classes at off site locations 
such training is also difficult to tailor to individuals training needs  cannot be easily reviewed and assessed by is managers and may not offer a cost effective training solution 
the limitations of instructor led training  combined with constrained is budgets  larger numbers of employees requiring training and the greater breadth of training needed per employee  have prompted organizations to consider alternative training methodologies 
idc estimates that the instructor led training market will see a decline in share from in to in idc also estimates that the technology based training will experience a compounded annual growth rate of versus growth for instructor led training 
the proliferation of computers throughout organizations and the increasing multimedia capabilities of computers are supporting the emergence of interactive it education and training software 
according to idc  the us market for interactive it education and training software  including multimedia software and electronic performance support systems  was million in  compared to million in  representing a compounded annual growth rate year over year 
the company believes that as businesses seek out alternative methods of training employees  there is a significant market opportunity for software that can meet businesses needs for productive  flexible and cost effective it education and training 
although interactive it education and training software programs have been available for many years  they currently account for only a small portion of the overall market for it training 
accordingly  the company s future success will depend upon  among other factors  the extent to which companies continue to adopt interactive education and training programs 
there can be no assurance that the use of interactive education and training software programs will become widespread or that the company s products will achieve commercial success 
the cbt group solution cbt group s solutions include a comprehensive library of interactive software titles at the end of designed to meet business and organizations it education and training needs 
cbt group s courseware may be used on networked and standalone pcs and may be deployed over intranets via cbt group s intranet deployment product  cbtweb  and the internet via cbt group s internet deployment product  cbtweb plus 
the courseware titles are organized into curricula and are designed to cover specific aspects of client server  mainframe  internet and intranet technologies 
each curriculum provides comprehensive training in an area of technology such as client server concepts  operating systems  networking  graphical user interfaces and database design 
in addition  the company has developed network based administration and assessment tools designed to allow is and human resource managers to track employee usage and performance of cbt group courseware 
the company has developed or is developing  both independently and through development and marketing alliances  titles focused on vendor specific products including microsoft windows nt  oracle database administrator and and developer  sap s r  netscape navigator  javascript and livewire  ibm lotus notes  informix online dynamic server  cisco router configuation curricula  novell netware  sybase powersoft powerbuilder  and marimba castanet 
in addition  cbt group has developed courseware titles in conjunction with ibm  sun microsystems and netscape for the java education world tour and has developed or is developing titles for cobol on mvs  aix  os and the internet security courseware consortium  which titles will include concept  platform  web server  and security technology curricula 
in september  the company and asymetrix corporation  a leading provider of online learning solutions  entered into a strategic partnership to provide organizations with a powerful and easy to use tool for creating their own customized computer based courseware 
the companies are developing toolbook ii for cbt group  which will incorporate the cbt group user interface  navigation  and overall look and feel with the power and flexibility of toolbook ii 
this will allow companies to create their own new customized courseware with the same look and feel that distinguishes cbt group library of interactive education software 
as with cbt group s standard courseware  content developed using toolbook ii for cbt group will be deployable over lans  wans  intranets  or on stand alone personal computers 
also in september  cbt group announced that it had acquired scholars 
com  a pioneering leader in internet based training  offering the services of online mentors as a resource for students taking cbt group courseware to help them pass vendor certification exams 
scholars focuses on integrating internet technologies with proven learning methodologies to deliver internet based  certification level mentoring services to students worldwide 
the company pairs cbt group s microsoft and novell approved interactive courseware with a team of vendor certified mentors  known as learning advisors  to provide flexible  self paced study via the internet 
this learning model extends the advantages of online learning by having learning advisors available to students twelve hours a day  seven days a week 
this methodology enables students to receive personalized assistance as they need it through online chats  email  and newsgroups 
the company s solutions offer many advantages to both end users and administrators over traditional instructor led training 
cbt group s courseware allows employees to tailor training to their work schedules  begin training at a level which is suitable to their needs  integrate training with on the job practice  train in only those topics that are relevant to their needs  and access training materials on an ongoing basis as reference tools 
cbt group software is interactive  allowing users to practice and test skills as they learn 
the courseware also incorporates sophisticated graphics and simulation technologies to demonstrate many of the concepts introduced 
in addition  the company s products are designed to allow administrators to leverage their training budgets by tailoring training programs to their organization s needs and tracking training usage and effectiveness 
organizations that invest in the cbt group solution can offer cbt group s training software across a network  corporate intranet or the internet to all employees 
cbt group licenses its courseware primarily through one  two or three year license agreements that provide access to its library of titles  which allows customers to build tailored training solutions 
under these license agreements  customers are able to exchange and update their courses on an annual basis as their internal training needs evolve or as technologies advance 
in addition  using the company s administrative software  is and human resource administrators can design and monitor training programs for each employee 
cbt group s strategy cbt group has entered into alliances with check point  cisco  informix  lotus  marimba  microsoft  netscape  network associates  novell  oracle  rsa data security  sap  security dynamics  sybase  verisign and the ibm sun microsystems netscape collaborative java education effort to develop and market product specific training 
in addition  cbt group has developed relationships with checkpoint software technologies  inc  network associates  inc  rsa data security  inc  security dynamics technologies  inc 
and verisign  inc 
as a result of its formation of the internet security curriculum consortium 
the company markets its software to fortune companies and other major us and international organizations primarily through a direct sales force 
the company has increased sales to smaller corporate customers through distributors and its telesales organization 
as of december   the company had approximately  corporate customers worldwide  including the following companies or their affiliates alcatel business systems corporation  american management systems  at t  the bear stearns companies  inc  bell atlantic corporation  blue cross blue shield mutual of ohio  british airways  cambridge technology partners  compaq computer corporation  computer sciences corporation  ctg  dell computer corporation  electronic data systems corporation  gte data services  international business machines corporation  mci communications  inc  medpartners  inc  price waterhouse llp  reuters plc  sprint corporation  tandem computers  unisys corporation  the university of california system  the united states air force and wells fargo company 
cbt group s objective is to maintain and expand its market position through the following strategies offer a broad library to its customers 
the company offers its customers a broad product library of software titles at the end of which it believes has created a competitive barrier to entry 
in  cbt group also delivered titles in german and french  and plans to deliver more translated titles in japanese  spanish  portuguese and other languages 
the company s strategy is to continue to expand its product library to allow the company to sign larger initial contracts and support incremental sales to its customer base over time 
leverage proprietary development technologies and processes 
the company has created a proprietary development engine and a streamlined development process to assist the company in bringing its products to market in a relatively short time frame and at a relatively low cost 
in addition  the company s technology generally supports a common product architecture  resulting in products which have a recognizable and consistent interface and are easier to support 
the company plans to continue investing significant resources in research and development to further enhance its underlying development engine and to accelerate the growth of its product library 
build alliances with key it vendors 
the company s strategy is to enter into development and marketing alliances with key it vendors to produce and distribute vendor specific authorized training programs 
to date  the company has entered into alliances with check point  cisco  informix  lotus  marimba  microsoft  netscape  network associates  novell  oracle  rsa data security  sap  security dynamics  sybase  verisign and the ibm sun microsystems netscape collaborative java education effort 
the company believes these alliances provide a number of competitive advantages  including access to partners product development plans  source material and distribution channels 
expand channels of distribution 
the company has primarily targeted fortune companies and other major us and international organizations primarily through its direct sales force 
during  cbt group began marketing its software to educational institutions and governmental agencies through a direct sales force 
the company s strategy is to expand its telesales organization and its channels of indirect sales in order to reach organizations which could not otherwise be effectively targeted by its direct sales force and to accelerate its market penetration worldwide 
the company s indirect sales channels are currently comprised of distributors  resellers and training organizations 
over the long term  the company intends to continue to explore electronic distribution through on line services  the internet and corporate intranets 
capitalize on multimedia technologies 
the company s current products include multimedia elements such as rich graphics  interactive text and simulations  and can be delivered on networked and standalone pcs 
the company s strategy is to enhance its products over time as its customers adopt enterprise wide systems which have the capability to handle the requirements of more advanced multimedia elements such as sound  video and complex animation 
in this regard  the company has entered into a licensing and development relationship with street technologies pursuant to which cbt group will have the ability to deliver such rich data types over the internet  corporate intranets and lans 
serve emerging internet intranet market opportunity 
the company believes that internet technologies  including the internet itself and the use of these technologies to create enterprise wide intranets  is radically altering the way certain critical computing activities are performed 
as the internet and intranets emerge as one computing platform  cbt group believes that new education and training needs will emerge as well 
the company will seek to build upon its current activities in order to build a franchise around internet and intranet education opportunities 
products the company s product library has grown from titles at december  to titles at december   encompassing over  hours of it education and training 
in general  cbt group s courseware includes a graphically sophisticated interface that leads students through the subject software  simulating the technology and requiring students to respond actively to the course 
cbt group interactive training typically provides the user with anywhere from to hours of instruction per individual title 
students may also use the courses to pre test their capabilities in order to position themselves properly within the course and to train only in relevant areas 
at the end of the course  students may take a test to measure accurately their mastery of the course content 
the results of this test may be viewed by a central administrator using cbt group s administrative program or exported to a standard database or spreadsheet 
cbt group has developed an enterprise wide network based administrative software program designed to allow a central administrator to audit the use of each course  track employee performance and create specialized curricula for employees by granting access to selected courses 
cbt group licenses its products primarily through license agreements under which customers may use the delivered products for a period of one  two or three years 
the license agreement format allows customers to exchange courses on each anniversary date where the agreement is for more than one year 
in order to increase the number of titles or gain access to the library at a time other than the specified dates  the customer may enter into a new license agreement or upgrade the existing license agreement 
volume and multi year discounts encourage customers to expand license agreements as their needs grow and as they become more familiar with the company s product library 
the company s pricing varies primarily based on the number of users  the number of titles selected and the length of the contract 
the company s strategy is to develop comprehensive curricula  each of which provides training in areas related to client server  mainframe and internet and intranet technologies 
the company s courses are generally compatible with windows based desktop pcs and netbios lans  and most of the company s recently developed courses are based on native windows implementations 
all of the company s courses are available for delivery on floppy disk or pc cd rom for installation on servers or standalone workstations 
in addition to its continued support of traditional lan environments  cbt group has developed a number of products which address the emerging internet and corporate markets 
cbtweb is an intranet deployment system which allows users to download cbt group courseware titles across an intranet 
access to these titles is gained through a standard browser 
cbtweb enables customers to access and manage cbt group courses over an intranet via internally managed web servers 
using cbtweb  learners can choose to either download cbt group courseware or interact with it in real time over an intranet using cbt systems liveplay capability 
the downloaded courseware contains a utility to send the student records back to a central administrator so that the student progress may be monitored 
cbtweb plus is a turnkey training solution that enables customers to benefit from internet based deployment of cbt group s entire library of titles without the need to install server side software on their own network 
cbtweb plus is an externally hosted version of cbtweb that allows customers to have their cbt group courseware managed over the internet from an external site 
cbtweb plus is designed to relieve customers of any network infrastructure or security issues  and minimizes human resource requirements  while providing the highest level of deployment flexibility since each student receives cbt group s training from his or her preferred location 
additionally  training administrators and is managers are assured that students receive the most up to date curricula since the cbtweb plus servers are maintained by cbt group and are continuously updated with the latest courseware at the company s centralized courseware development center in dublin  ireland 
in july  cbt group announced the release of cbtcampus  cbt group s next generation training management and deployment architecture 
coupled with cbt group s library of titles  cbtcampus provides cbt group s customers with a modular  fully integrated  and extensible solution for delivering sophisticated interactive technology training wherever and however it s needed  whether running over an intranet or across a local area network 
cbtcampus features a university campus metaphor as an easy to navigate student interface  which can be accessed either as a windows client application or a web browser plug in 
behind this intuitive interface is a suite of sophisticated technologies that creates a seamless integrated learning environment for students and administrators 
cbtcampus was designed to give high performance results across a full range of environments 
it provides powerful deployment flexibility regardless of an organization s mix of networked systems  and will enable students to access courses seamlessly over an intranet or the internet  over a lan  or on their stand alone desktop or laptop computers 
the market for it education and training is rapidly evolving 
new methods of delivering interactive education software are being developed and offered in the marketplace  including intranet and internet deployment systems 
many of these new delivery systems will involve new and different business models and contracting mechanisms 
in addition  multimedia and other product functionality features are being added to the educational software 
accordingly  cbt group s future success will depend upon  among other factors  the extent to which cbt group is able to develop and implement products which address these emerging market requirements 
there can be no assurance that cbt group will be successful in meeting changing market needs 
failure to develop and implement products which address these emerging market requirements could have a material adverse affect on cbt group s business and results of operations 
moreover  software products as complex as those offered by the company may contain undetected errors or fail when first introduced or upon release of new versions of the company s products 
there can be no assurance that  despite testing by the company and by current and potential customers  errors will not be found in new products after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in a loss of or delay in market acceptance 
the subject matter of the company s courseware is influenced by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  changes in customer needs and frequent introductions of new products by software vendors 
accordingly  the company believes that its future success will depend in large part upon its ability to meet these changes by enhancing its existing courses and developing and introducing new courses on a timely basis 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in addressing the changing needs of the marketplace by developing and marketing new products or enhancing its existing products on a timely basis 
if the company were unable  due to resource  technological or other constraints  to anticipate and respond adequately to changes in customers software technology and preferences  the company s business and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
research and development cbt group believes that the development of an effective training product requires the convergence of source material  instructional design and computer technology 
the first step in developing a new training program is to obtain content through subject matter experts  existing courses  including self study courses  and product reference materials  including product manuals 
the cbt group development team then writes a script for the program which includes a structure covering all of the relevant concepts  tasks to be completed  interactive features and tests to measure achievement and to reinforce the lesson 
during the development of a script for a new program  the company s developers  working with animators  simulation programmers and graphic designers  simultaneously plan and develop the course elements 
these elements are then integrated into a single program 
the program is then tested to ensure that each course delivers the desired education and training 
the core of cbt group s product development is its product development engine an environment comprising cbt group proprietary software and off the shelf tools which has been optimized for the creation of interactive software training programs 
the company believes that its product development engine provides a competitive advantage by allowing the company to create modular courses  identify and change portions of a course without rewriting the entire course  port courses more easily across operating systems and enhance the multimedia content of its courses more quickly and efficiently 
the company s technology generally supports a common product architecture  resulting in products that have a recognizable and consistent interface and are easier to support 
the company s goal is to continue to enhance its product development engine to meet the company s future development needs  including ensuring that its courseware is able to incorporate a wide variety of multimedia elements 
the company performs substantially all of its research and development activities and develops substantially all of its courses at its dublin  ireland development facility 
from time to time  the company subcontracts outside development services to develop portions of particular courses 
in addition  all products produced using these outside developers remain the sole property of cbt group 
during  and  research and development expenses totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
during  the company s research and development staff grew from to employees 
the company intends to continue to make substantial investments in research and development 
development and marketing alliances the company s strategy is to expand its position in the it education and training market by forming development and marketing alliances with leading it software vendors 
to date  the company has formed alliances with check point  cisco  informix  lotus  marimba  microsoft  netscape  network associates  novell  oracle  rsa data security  sap  security dynamics  sybase  verisign and the ibm sun microsystems netscape collaborative java education effort 
the company believes its development and marketing alliances offer it a number of competitive advantages  including early access to the vendor s software engineers and technical advisors for assistance in developing courses on new products 
with the approval of the development partner  products developed under the relationship can be identified as authorized by that software vendor  which the company believes improves the marketability of such courses 
in addition  these alliances may result in additional distribution channels for the company  by allowing each party to distribute courses to its respective customer base 
in some of these alliances  the software vendor has contributed financial resources toward the development of specified courses 
the company has recognized the revenue from such development payments on a percentage of completion basis as products are produced or  where required in the contract  as the company has met specified milestones 
the company believes that these alliances also provide significant benefits to the software vendors by allowing them to achieve additional market penetration generated by increasing the base of trained users 
the company believes that an increasing proportion of its revenues in the future may be attributable to products developed through its alliances 
there can be no assurance that any of these parties will continue to cooperate with the company  that the company will be able to develop successfully courses for its development and marketing alliances in a timely fashion or at all  or that the company will be able to negotiate additional alliances in the future on acceptable terms or at all 
there can be no assurance that the marketing efforts of the company s partners will not disrupt the company s direct sales efforts 
in addition  the company s development and marketing partners could pursue their existing or alternative training programs in preference to and in competition with those being developed with the company 
in the event that the company is not able to maintain or expand its current development and marketing alliances or enter into new development and marketing alliances  the company s operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
furthermore  the company is required to pay royalties to its development and marketing partners on products developed with them  which reduces the company s gross margins 
the company expects that cost of revenues may fluctuate from period to period in the future based upon many factors  including the mix of titles licensed between titles developed exclusively by cbt group and royalty bearing titles developed pursuant to development and marketing alliances and the timing of expenses associated with development and marketing alliances 
in addition  the collaborative nature of the development process under these alliances may result in longer development times and less control over the timing of product introductions than for courses developed solely by the company 
customers the company primarily licenses its courses to fortune companies and other major us and international organizations in a wide range of industries  including manufacturing  transportation  telecommunications  utilities  banking  healthcare  securities  computers and insurance 
cbt group also licenses its courseware to educational institutions and governmental agencies 
the company markets its courseware through its direct sales organization to approximately  corporate customers worldwide and through its telesales organization to approximately  customers worldwide 
the company also distributes its courses through a number of resellers 
no customer accounted for more than of revenues in backlog the company generates a substantial portion of its revenue through multi year license agreements 
the initial annual license fee is generally recognized at the time of delivery of products 
subsequent annual license fees are recognized on the anniversary date of such delivery  or if the customer exchanges courses at the anniversary date  upon delivery of the exchanged courses 
backlog at any given date represents the amount of all license fees under current agreements which have not yet been recognized as revenue 
although the company s license agreements are noncancellable by their terms  there can be no assurance that any customer will fulfill the contractual obligations under its agreement 
cancellation  reduction or delay in orders by or shipments to any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the amount and timing of the recognition of revenue associated with this backlog can vary depending on the timing of future deliveries of products and amendments to customers license agreements 
the company had backlog of approximately million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
approximately of the company s backlog as of december  was concentrated among seven customers 
intellectual property and licenses the company regards its software as proprietary and relies primarily on a combination of statutory and common law copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  customer licensing agreements  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect its proprietary rights 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use the company s courseware or technology without authorization  or to develop similar courseware or technology independently 
furthermore  the laws of certain countries in which the company sells its products do not protect the company s software and intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
the company generally does not include in its software any mechanisms to prevent or inhibit unauthorized use  but generally requires the execution of a license agreement which restricts copying and use of the company s products 
if unauthorized copying or misuse of the company s products were to occur to any substantial degree  the company s business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the company s means of protecting its proprietary rights will be adequate or that the company s competitors will not independently develop similar technology 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not claim that the company s current or future products infringe on the proprietary rights of others 
the company expects that software developers will increasingly be subject to such claims as the number of products and competitors in the it education and training industry grows and the functionality of products in the industry overlaps 
any such claim  with or without merit  could result in costly litigation or might require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or license agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to the company  or at all 
competition the it education and training market is highly fragmented and competitive  and the company expects this competition to increase 
the company expects that because of the lack of significant barriers to entry into the it education and training market  new competitors may enter the market in the future 
in addition  larger companies are competing with the company in the it education and training market through the acquisition of the company s competitors  and the company expects this trend to continue 
such competitors may also include publishing companies and vendors of application software  including those vendors with whom the company has formed development and marketing alliances 
the company competes primarily with third party suppliers of instructor led it education and training and internal training departments 
to a lesser extent  the company also competes with other suppliers of it education and training  including several other companies that produce interactive software training  consultants  value added resellers and network integrators 
certain of these value added resellers also market products competitive with those of the company 
the company expects that as organizations increase their dependence on outside suppliers of training  the company will face increasing competition from these other suppliers as it education and training managers more frequently compare training products provided by outside suppliers 
many of the company s current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  as well as greater name recognition  than the company

overview cbt cbt group or the company is a leading provider of interactive software generally designed to meet businesses information technology it education and training needs 
the company develops  publishes and markets a broad library of over software titles focused on client server  internet and corporate intranet technologies and delivered on networked and standalone pcs and over corporate intranets 
the company derives revenues primarily from license agreements under which customers license the company s titles for periods of one  two or three years 
the license agreement format generally allows the customer to exchange titles for other titles in the company s library on an annual basis if the agreement is for more than one year 
the initial annual license fee is generally recognized as revenue at the time of delivery of products  and subsequent annual license fees are generally recognized on the anniversary of each delivery date 
although the company s license agreements are noncancellable by their terms  there can be no assurance that any customer will fulfill the contractual obligations under its agreement 
cancellation  reduction or delay in orders by or shipments to any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
in addition  the company derives revenues from sales of its courses  primarily through its direct sales and telesales organizations and resellers 
in recent years  the company has entered into several development and marketing alliances with key vendors of client server  internet intranet and enterprise software  under which the company develops titles for training on specific products 
under certain of its development and marketing alliances  the company s partners have agreed to fund certain product development costs 
the company recognizes such funding as revenues on a percentage of completion basis  and the costs associated with such revenues are reflected as cost of revenues 
these agreements have the effect of shifting expenses associated with developing certain new products from research and development to cost of revenues 
the company expects that cost of revenues may fluctuate from period to period in the future based upon many factors  including  but not limited to  the timing of expenses associated with development and marketing alliances 
the company does not expect funding from development partners to contribute significantly to revenues in future years 
recent developments on march   the company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the forefront group  inc  a houston based provider of high quality  cost effective  computer based training products and network utilities for technical professionals forefront 
in the merger  each share of forefront common stock will be exchanged for adss  and the company will assume outstanding forefront stock options  warrants and other rights to acquire forefront common stock 
as a result of the merger  the company will issue approximately million adss and assume options  warrants and other rights that may be converted into up to approximately million adss 
the transaction is intended to be tax free to shareholders and is intended to be accounted for as a pooling of interests 
consummation of the transaction is subject to expiration or termination of the applicable hart scott rodino waiting period  approval of the merger by forefront stockholders and other customary closing conditions 
the merger is expected to be completed during the second quarter of consummation of the transaction is subject to a number of risk factors  including those discussed below and under additional risk factors that could affect operating results 
on march   the company effected a two for one split of its issued and outstanding adss whereby each issued and outstanding ads is now represented by one fourth of one ordinary share and each issued and outstanding ordinary share that is deposited with the bank of new york  as depositary  is represented by four adss 
unless stated otherwise herein  all references to the company s adss are on a post split basis 
the successful combination of cbt group and forefront  including the successful operation of forefront as an autonomous subsidiary of cbt group  will require substantial effort from each company 
the diversion of the attention of management and any difficulties encountered in the transition process could have an adverse impact on cbt group s ability to realize the full benefits of the merger 
the successful combination of the two companies will also require coordination of their research and development and sales and marketing efforts 
in addition  the process of combining the two organizations could cause the interruption of  or loss of momentum in  forefront s activities 
there can be no assurance that cbt group will be able to retain forefront s key management  technical  sales and customer support personnel  or that it will realize any of the anticipated benefits of the merger 
certain of forefront s existing customers or strategic partners may view themselves as competitors of cbt group s  and therefore determine that the merger is competitively disadvantageous to them 
as a consequence  forefront s relationships with these customers or strategic partners could be adversely affected by the merger  which could adversely affect the ability of cbt group to continue relationships with such customers after the merger 
in december  cbt group and street technologies  inc street technologies  a developer of technology to stream multimedia and other large data files to permit real time delivery over local and wide area networks  corporate intranets and the internet  entered into an agreement pursuant to which the companies would work together to deploy cbt group s interactive education software over corporate intranets and the internet 
as part of the agreement  cbt group acquired a ownership interest in street technologies and street technologies agreed that its license will be exclusive to cbt group within a defined group of companies 
in december cbt group exchanged its ownership interest in street technologies  and  in cash  for a perpetual license of street technologies deployment tools 
annual results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of revenues for the three years in the period ended december  years ended december  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative costs of acquisitions total operating expenses income from operations other income  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income revenues revenues increased from million in to million in and to million in the increases in revenues during these periods were primarily attributable to an increase in the number of available courses  strong customer contract renewals and upgrades and expanded marketing and distribution efforts 
approximately  and of revenues in  and  respectively  were attributable to development revenues derived from agreements with the company s development partners 
the company does not expect funding from development partners to contribute significantly to revenues in future years 
revenues in the united states increased from million or of revenues in to million or of revenues in and to million or of revenues in the increases in and were primarily the result of significant increases in the number of sales and related personnel employed in the united states  an increase in the number of available courses and an expansion of the company s customer base 
while revenues in the united states increased significantly in absolute terms over these periods  the company s sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses in the united states also increased rapidly as the company hired and expanded its staff to support the us sales growth 
revenues in europe were million or of revenues in  million or of revenues in  and million or of revenues in  respectively 
revenues from outside the united states and europe principally from australia  canada  south africa and mideast in were million or of revenues in  million or of revenues in  and million or of revenues in  respectively 
because a significant portion of the company s business is conducted outside the united states  the company is subject to numerous risks of doing business in other countries  including risks related to currency fluctuations 
no customer accounted for more than of revenues in  or however  approximately of the company s backlog at december  was concentrated among seven customers  compared to among nine customers at december  backlog at any given date represents the amount of all license fees under current agreements which have not yet been recognized as revenues 
although the company s license agreements are noncancellable by their terms  there can be no assurance that any customer will fulfill the contractual obligations under its agreement 
cancellation  reduction or delay in orders by or shipments to any of these or other customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
cost of revenues cost of revenues includes the cost of materials such as cd roms  diskettes  packaging and documentation  royalties to third parties  the portion of development costs associated with funded development projects and fulfillment costs 
gross margins increased from in to in and to in the increase in gross margins in and is primarily due to the inclusion in cost of revenues for of certain costs cls consult gmbh  the company s german subsidiary  had incurred in developing its sap interactive training software 
cls  which was in an earlier stage of development in  outsourced a substantial portion of its product development to third parties  and the associated expenses had been included in cost of revenues for during and  these activities were conducted at cls  and no royalties were therefore payable 
accordingly  these expenses are included in research and development expenses for and the inclusion of these development costs in cost of revenues had the corresponding effect of reducing research and development expenses in the inclusion of ala also impacted gross margins in and gross margins were lower in principally as a result of royalty payments to third party providers which were higher than the average royalty payments paid by cbt group 
in  the previously outsourced products for resale were replaced by cbt group product 
the company expects that cost of revenues may fluctuate from period to period in the future based upon many factors  including the mix of titles licensed between titles developed exclusively by cbt group and royalty bearing titles developed pursuant to development and marketing alliances and the timing of expenses associated with development and marketing alliances 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  occupancy expenses  fees paid to outside consultants and travel expenses 
research and development expenses increased in absolute terms and as a percentage of revenues from million or of revenues in to million or of revenues in and to million or of revenues in  principally as a result of an increase in research and development personnel employed to expand and enhance the company s library of software products 
in addition  approximately   and  of development expenses incurred in connection with development and marketing alliances were charged to cost of revenues in  and  respectively 
the company believes that significant investment in research and development is required to remain competitive in the it education and training market  and the company therefore expects research and development expenses to continue to increase in future periods 
software development costs are accounted for in accordance with the financial accounting standards board statement no 
 under which the company is required to capitalize software development costs after technological feasibility has been established 
to date  development costs after establishment of technological feasibility have been immaterial  and all software development costs have been expensed as incurred 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions  occupancy expenses and advertising  promotional expenses and travel expenses 
these expenses increased in absolute terms from million or of revenues in to million or of revenues in and to million or of revenues in the increase in absolute terms of sales and marketing expenses is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of sales and sales support personnel 
commission costs have also increased in absolute terms along with the increases in revenues during these periods 
the company also increased significantly advertising and promotional expenses in each of and the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues from to was principally due to more rapid increases in revenues than in associated expenses 
the company expects to increase sales and marketing expenses in the future to support expansion of its sales and marketing efforts 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased in absolute terms from million or of revenues in to million or of revenues in and to million or of revenues in the increases in absolute terms were primarily due to increased staffing to support expanding operations 
the decrease as a percentage of revenues from to was principally due to more rapid increases in revenues than in associated expenses 
the company anticipates that general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods due to increases in staffing and infrastructure 
other income  net other income  net  comprises interest expense  interest income and exchange gains and losses 
the company recognized other income  net  of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increases in other income in and were primarily the result of interest received on proceeds deposited from the company s initial and secondary public offerings in in addition  the company recognized an exchange loss of  in  and exchange gains of  and  in and  respectively 
the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in dollars  although several of the company s subsidiaries have functional currencies other than the dollar  and a significant portion of the company s and its subsidiaries revenues  costs and assets are denominated in currencies other than their respective functional currencies 
fluctuations in exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  particularly its operating margins  and could result in exchange losses 
the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on the company s results of operations cannot be accurately predicted 
to date  the company has not sought to hedge the risks associated with fluctuations in the exchange rate  but may undertake such transactions in the future 
there can be no assurance that any hedging techniques implemented by the company would be successful in eliminating or reducing the effects of currency fluctuations 
provision for income taxes cbt group plc operates as a holding company with operating subsidiaries in several countries  and each subsidiary is taxed based on the laws of the jurisdiction in which it operates 
because taxes are incurred at the subsidiary level  and one subsidiary s tax losses cannot be used to offset the taxable income of subsidiaries in other tax jurisdictions  the company s consolidated effective tax rate may increase to the extent that the company reports tax losses in some subsidiaries and taxable income in others 
the company has significant operations and generates a majority of its taxable income in the republic of ireland  and certain of the company s irish operating subsidiaries are taxed at rates substantially lower than tax rates in effect in the united states and other countries in which the company has operations 
one irish subsidiary currently qualifies for a tax rate and another irish subsidiary is income tax exempt 
if such subsidiaries were no longer to qualify for such tax rates or if the tax laws were rescinded or changed  the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected 
the standard rate of irish corporation tax on both trading and non trading income presently from january  is 
the incentive rate referred to above applies in respect of income derived from certain activities carried out in the republic of ireland 
the incentive rate will continue up to december  from january  it has been confirmed by the government of ireland in an announcement by the irish minister for finance on december  that the corporation tax rate will be on trading income and on non trading income 
moreover  because the company incurs income tax in several countries  an increase in the profitability of the company in one or more of these countries could result in a higher overall tax rate 
in addition  if tax authorities were to challenge successfully the manner in which profits are recognized among the company s subsidiaries  the company s taxes could increase and its cash flow and net income could be materially adversely affected 
the company s provision for income taxes was million  million and million for each of  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for the company was  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate from to and to was principally the result of losses incurred by pooled entities in both and which were not available to offset taxable income earned in other jurisdictions

the company s revenues historically have been highest in the fourth quarter of each year 
sales in the fourth quarter represented and of total revenues in and  respectively 
sales in the fourth quarter increased more rapidly than expenses and  accordingly  net income in the fourth quarter of and represented approximately and  respectively  of total net income for such years 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to experience significant increases in revenues and profitability in the fourth quarter of future years 
any failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results for the year as a whole 
in each quarter of  gross margins were lower than the comparable quarter in principally as a result of the inclusion in cost of revenues on a quarterly basis of certain costs which ala had incurred in outsourcing product for resale 
in  the previously outsourced products for resale were replaced by cbt group product and the corresponding cost of revenues was lower 
during  the company hired a number of employees  particularly sales and marketing personnel  which resulted in an increase in sales and marketing expenses for the year 
the company also added a significant number of research and development personnel 
as a result of these increases  as well as continued hiring in other departments  the company expects operating expenses in future periods to be significantly higher than in prior periods 
the company anticipates that it will continue this hiring in the first half of  which will reduce operating margins  particularly in the first and second quarters 
liquidity and capital resources cash and short term investments were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease from to was due to the company s investment in street technologies and a significant increase in purchases of property and equipment which was partially offset by an increase in cash provided by operating activities and from the issuance of ordinary shares 
the increase from to was from the exercise of options and by cash provided by operating activities which was offset by purchases of property  equipment and fixtures 
net cash provided by operating activities increased from million in to million in and decreased to million in the increased cash flow from operations in was primarily attributable to net income of million in the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in was primarily due to a significant increase in accounts receivable in capital expenditures were approximately million in  million in and million in although the company currently has no material capital commitments  it expects that it will continue to spend more in  primarily as a result of setting up new facilities and to continuing to upgrade the capabilities of its computer equipment as well as improvements to its information systems 
cash requirements are expected to continue to increase in order to fund i personnel and salary costs  ii research and development costs  iii investment in additional equipment and facilities and iv working capital requirements 
the company believes that its existing cash and short term investments will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the company may from time to time consider the acquisition of complementary businesses  products or technologies  which may require additional financing 
the foregoing statement regarding the company s expectations for continued liquidity is a forward looking statement  and actual results may differ materially depending on a variety of factors  including variable operating results or presently unexpected uses of cash such as mergers and acquisitions

the introduction of statement no 
had no impact on the company in additional risk factors that could affect operating results in addition to the other factors identified in this annual report  the following risk factors could materially and adversely affect the company s future operating results  and could cause actual events to differ materially from those predicted in the company s forward looking statements relating to its business 
fluctuations in operating results 
the company has in the past experienced fluctuations in its quarterly operating results and anticipates that such fluctuations will continue and could intensify in the future 
fluctuations in operating results may result in volatility in the price of the company s adss 
although the company was profitable in each of the last twelve quarters  there can be no assurance that such profitability will continue in the future or that the levels of profitability will not vary significantly among quarterly periods 
the company s operating results may fluctuate as a result of many factors  including timing and effect of mergers and acquisitions  size and timing of orders and shipments  mix of sales between products developed solely by the company and products developed through development and marketing alliances  royalty rates  the announcement  introduction and acceptance of new products  product enhancements and technologies by the company and its competitors  mix of sales between the company s field sales force  its other direct sales channels and its indirect sales channels  competitive conditions in the industry  loss of significant customers  delays in availability of existing or new products  spending patterns of the company s customers  currency fluctuations and general economic conditions 
the company s expense levels are based in significant part on its expectations regarding future revenues and are fixed to a large extent in the short term 
accordingly  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
any significant revenue shortfall would therefore have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
in addition  the company hired additional employees in and in early this increase in employee expense could have a negative impact on the company s operating margins during foreign currency impact 
with more than a quarter of the company s revenues outside the united states  sales were negatively impacted in due to the continued strength of the us dollar against other major currencies 
at current exchange rates  the company anticipates quarter to quarter comparisons could continue to be negatively affected by currency adjustments through fiscal competition 
the it education and training market is highly fragmented and competitive  and the company expects this competition to increase 
the company expects that because of the lack of significant barriers to entry into this market  new competitors may enter the market in the future 
in addition  larger companies are competing with the company in the it education and training market through the acquisition of the company s competitors  and the company expects this trend to continue 
such competitors may also include publishing companies and vendors of application software  including those vendors with whom the company has formed development and marketing alliances 
the company competes primarily with third party suppliers of instructor led it education and training and internal training departments and with other suppliers of it education and training  including several other companies that produce interactive software training 
to a lesser extent  the company also competes with consultants  value added resellers and network integrators 
certain of these value added resellers also market products competitive with those of the company 
the company expects that as organizations increase their dependence on outside suppliers of training  the company will face increasing competition from these other suppliers as it education and training managers more frequently compare training products provided by outside suppliers 
many of the company s current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  as well as greater name recognition  than the company 
in addition  the it education and training market is characterized by significant price competition  and the company expects that it will face increasing price pressures from competitors as is managers demand more value for their training budgets 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to provide products that compare favorably with new instructor led techniques or other interactive training software or that competitive pressures will not require the company to reduce its prices significantly 
developing market 
the market for it education and training is rapidly evolving 
new methods of delivering interactive education software are being developed and offered in the marketplace  including intranet and internet deployment systems 
many of these new delivery systems will involve new and different business models and contracting mechanisms 
in addition  multimedia and other product functionality features are being added to the educational software 
accordingly  cbt group s future success will depend upon  among other factors  the extent to which cbt group is able to develop and implement products which address these emerging market requirements 
there can be no assurance that cbt group will be successful in meeting changing market needs 
in particular  cbt group has announced its next generation education deployment and management system  cbt campus 
if cbt campus were to fail to secure market acceptance  sales of cbt group courseware  and cbt group s operating results  could be materially adversely affected 
seasonality 
the software industry generally  and the company in particular  are subject to seasonal revenue fluctuations  based in part on customers annual budgetary cycles and in part on the annual nature of sales quotas 
these seasonal trends have in the past caused  and in the future could cause  revenues in the first quarter of a year to be less  perhaps substantially so  than revenues for the immediately preceding fourth quarter 
in addition  the company has in past years as well as in added significant headcount in the sales and marketing and research and development functions in the first quarter  and to a lesser extent  the second quarter 
because these headcount additions do not immediately contribute significant revenues  the company s operating margins in the earlier part of the year tend to be significantly lower than in the later parts of the year 
it is expected that this factor will affect cbt group s operating margins in the first and second quarters of  and to some extent the third quarter 
many software companies also experience a seasonal downturn in demand during the summer months 
there can be no assurance that these or other seasonal trends will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
management of expanding operations and acquisitions 
the company has recently experienced rapid expansion of its operations  which has placed  and is expected to continue to place  significant demands on the company s administrative  operational and financial personnel and systems 
the company s future operating results will substantially depend on the ability of its officers and key employees to manage changing business conditions and to implement and improve its operational  financial control and reporting systems 
if the company is unable to respond to and manage changing business conditions  its business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
as a result of the consummation of the acquisitions of personal training systems  inc pts in late  cls and ntt in may  ala and benelux on february   scholars 
com in august and mideast on december  the company s operating expenses have increased 
in addition  if the forefront merger is consummated  the company expects that operating expenses will increase as a result of such transaction 
there can be no assurance that the integration of these businesses can be successfully completed in a timely fashion  or at all  or that the revenues from the acquired businesses will be sufficient to support the costs associated with those businesses  without adversely affecting the company s operating margins 
any failure to successfully complete the integration in a timely fashion or to generate sufficient revenues from the acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company regularly evaluates acquisition opportunities and is likely to make acquisitions in the future 
future acquisitions by the company could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  which could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
product and technology acquisitions entail numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations  technologies and products  diversion of management s attention to other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which the company has no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees of acquired companies 
the company s management has had limited experience in assimilating acquired organizations and products into the company s operations 
no assurance can be given as to the ability of the company to integrate successfully any operations  personnel or products that have been acquired or that might be acquired in the future  and the failure of the company to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s future success depends  in large part  on the continued service of its key management  sales  product development and operational personnel and on its ability to attract  motivate and retain highly qualified employees  including management personnel 
in particular  the loss of certain senior management personnel or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
in addition  the company depends on writers  programmers and graphic artists  as well as third party content providers 
the company expects to continue to hire additional product development  sales and marketing  information services and accounting staff 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting  retaining or motivating key personnel 
the inability to hire and retain qualified personnel or the loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect upon the company s current business  new product development efforts and future business prospects 
risk of increasing taxes 
certain of the company s subsidiaries have significant operations and generate significant taxable income in ireland  and certain of the company s irish subsidiaries are taxed at rates substantially lower than tax rates in effect in the united states and in other countries in which the company has operations 
the extent of the tax benefit could vary from period to period  and there can be no assurance that the company s tax situation will not change 
year risk 
the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the millennium year approaches 
the year issue is pervasive and complex  as virtually every computer operation will be affected in the same way by the rollover of the two digit year value to the issue is whether computer systems will properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
the company is assessing both the internal readiness of its computer systems and the compliance of its software sold to customers for handling the year the company expects to implement successfully the systems and programming changes necessary to address year issues  and does not believe that the cost of such actions will have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
there can be no assurance  however  that there will not be a delay in  or increased costs associated with  the implementation of such changes  and the company s inability to implement such changes could have an adverse effect on future results of operations 
with the exception of cbt group s dos based courseware and its wintracs administrative tracking tool  the company is satisfied that the software it supplies to its customers is year compliant and it is not dependent on its customers implementing the systems and programming changes necessary to handle the year the company is utilizing both internal and external resources to identify  correct or reprogram  and test the systems for year compliance 
it is anticipated that all reprogramming  except for cbt group products which will no longer be available beginning december   will be complete by june   allowing adequate time for testing 
this process includes getting confirmations from the company s primary vendors that plans are being developed or are already in place to address processing transactions in the year however  there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely also will be timely converted or that any such failure to convert by another company would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems
