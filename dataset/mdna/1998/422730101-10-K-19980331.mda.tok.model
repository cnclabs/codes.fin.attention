item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations hector communications corporation hcc owns a interest in five local exchange telephone subsidiaries and one cable television subsidiary 
effective april   a new owned subsidiary of the company  alliance telecommunications corporation alliance  acquired ollig utilities company ollig for  at december   the company s wholly and majority owned subsidiaries provided telephone service to  access lines in rural communities in minnesota  wisconsin  south dakota and iowa 
its cable television operations provided cable television services to approximately  subscribers in minnesota  south dakota and wisconsin 
the company is also an investor in businesses providing cellular telephone and other telecommunications related services 
results of operations general the company s telephone revenues are principally derived from the local service and access revenues received by its local exchange carrier lec subsidiaries 
local service revenues are earned by providing customers with local service to connecting points within the local exchange boundaries and  in certain cases  to nearby local exchanges under extended area service eas plans which eliminate long distance charges to the neighboring exchanges 
monthly rates for telephone service differ among the lecs depending upon the cost of providing service  the type and grade of service  the number of customers and calling patterns within the toll free calling area and other factors 
access revenues are received by lecs for intrastate and interstate exchange services provided to long distance carriers generally referred to as interexchange carriers or ixcs which enable ixcs to provide long distance service to end users in the local exchange network 
access revenues are determined  in the case of interstate calls  according to rules promulgated by the federal communications commission fcc and administered by the national exchange carriers association neca and  in the case of intrastate calls  by state regulatory agencies 
a relatively small portion of the company s access revenues are derived from subscriber line fees determined by the fcc and billed directly to end users for access to long distance carriers 
the balance of the company s interstate access revenues are received from neca  which collects payments from ixcs and distributes settlement payments to lecs based on a number of factors  including the cost of providing service and the amount of time the local network is utilized to provide long distance services 
a variety of factors  including increased subscriber counts  cultural and technological changes  and rate reductions by ixcs  have resulted in a consistent pattern of increasing use of the nation s telephone network since this growth has produced higher revenues for neca and increased settlements for its participating lecs 
the company s settlements from neca have increased every year since the pool was established in lecs also sell and lease customer premise telephone equipment  provide inside wiring services and custom calling features  provide internet access and sell and lease other facilities for private line  teletype  data transmission and other communications services 
lecs also provide billing and collection services for certain ixcs in lieu of such ixcs directly billing customers within the lecs service area 
the company s cable television revenues are derived almost exclusively from monthly fees for basic and premium services
