these relationships provide physicians with the opportunity to operate under a variety of payor arrangements and to increase their patient flow 
the company offers medical group practices and independent physicians a range of affiliation models which are described in note of the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
these affiliations are carried out by the acquisition of ppm entities or practice assets  either for cash or equity  or by affiliation on a contractual basis

see item legal proceedings 
in response to certain of these setbacks  assembly of a new management team began in january when richard m 
scrushy was named chairman of the board and acting chief executive officer 
another step was taken in march when edwin m 
crawford was named president and chief executive officer 
mr 
scrushy will remain chairman of the board and brings his extensive healthcare experience  most recently his years as chairman of the board and chief executive officer of healthsouth corporation  to this position 
mr 
crawford joins medpartners from magellan health services  inc formerly charter medical corporation where he served as chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer 
mr 
crawford has been credited with successfully turning around magellan s operations  transforming the company from a psychiatric provider operation into a managed care company  and expanding the company into the rapidly growing market of specialty disease management 
in addition to these management changes  the company reorganized and streamlined its ppm organizational structure to strengthen management  speed integration  improve operations and facilitate communications 
results of operations in june  the company combined with inphynet in a transaction that was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
the financial information referred to in this discussion reflects the combined operations of this entity and several other entities accounted for as additional poolings of interests 
the following table sets forth the earnings summary by service area for the periods indicated 
operating income loss represents earnings loss before interest and income taxes and excludes merger expenses and restructuring and impairment charges 
year ended december  in thousands physician practice services net revenue    operating income loss    margin pharmaceutical services net revenue    operating income    margin contract medical services net revenue    operating income    margin international net revenue    operating income loss   margin corporate services operating loss    percentage of total net revenue physician practice services the company s ppm revenues have increased substantially over the past three years primarily due to growth in prepaid enrollment  existing practice growth and new practice affiliations 
of the total ppm revenue  billion can be attributed to acquisitions made during the year 
the company s ppm operations in the western region of the country function in a predominantly prepaid environment 
the company s ppm operations in the other regions of the country are in predominantly fee for service environments with limited but increasing managed care penetration 
the following table sets forth the breakdown of net revenue for the ppm services area for the periods indicated year ended december  in thousands prepaid    fee for service    other    total net revenue from ppm service area    the company s prepaid revenue reflects the number of hmo enrollees for whom it receives monthly capitation payments 
the company receives professional capitation to provide physician services and institutional capitation to provide hospital care and other non professional services 
the table below reflects the growth in enrollment for professional and global capitation at december  professional enrollees    global enrollees professional and institutional    total enrollees    during  prepaid revenues increased while prepaid enrollees increased 
the reason for this difference relates to the mix of professional capitation enrollment to total enrollment which includes institutional capitation 
the percentage of professional capitation enrollment to total enrollment was at december  compared to at december  revenue per enrollee for professional capitation is substantially lower than global capitation 
therefore  the lower percentage of professional capitation enrollment accounts for the higher percentage increase in prepaid revenue as compared to the percentage increase in total enrollment 
the company will attempt to profit from increased revenues  operational efficiencies and synergies produced by the exchange of ideas among physicians and managers across geographic boundaries and varied areas of specialization 
the ppm service area  for example  has established medical management committees that meet monthly to discuss implementation of the best medical management techniques to assist the company s affiliated physicians in delivering the highest quality of care at lower costs in a consistent fashion 
the ppm service area has also created a medical advisory committee  which is developing procedures for the identification  packaging and dissemination of the best clinical practices within the company s medical groups 
the medical advisory committee also provides the company s affiliated physicians a forum to discuss innovative ways to improve the delivery of healthcare 
during the fourth quarter of  the ppm service area began a difficult process of restructuring and reorganization which included practice disassociations  site closings  physician and staff reductions and systems standardization and conversions 
specifically  the company closed a total of clinic locations  primarily in southern california 
some closings also occurred in nevada  arizona and northern california 
most of the locations were redundant in nature due to the rapid acquisition of several group practices in the region 
the closings resulted in the elimination of approximately physicians and employees 
the company has also disassociated with smaller practices  all of which were in the eastern area of the country 
these practices  which represent approximately physicians  accounted for approximately million in annual revenue 
the disassociations were by mutual agreement and were the result of the fact that the economics of the practice management agreements were not in the best interest of the company or the physicians 
as part of the restructuring process  the west coast operations were restructured into three regions southern california  northwest idaho  oregon  and washington and southwest arizona  nevada  new mexico  oklahoma  texas and utah 
each region is headed by a leadership team composed of physicians and managers 
additionally  the company moved to strengthen the financial capability of its west coast operations  internalize its actuarial capabilities to enhance risk management functions and strengthen the managed care contracting process 
the company recorded a pre tax charge during the fourth quarter of of million related primarily to the restructuring and impairment of selected assets of certain of its clinic operations within the ppm division 
of the total charge  million relates to cash charges including employee and physician severance million  leases million and other exits costs million  million relates to the impairment of goodwill  primarily in the southern california and southwestern markets  and million relates to the write down of various assets 
the impairment of goodwill and write down of other assets are non cash charges 
the operating loss for the year ended december   was million compared to an operating profit of million for the year ended december  the loss was the result of greater than anticipated costs in the company s ppm operations  primarily related to higher than expected medical utilization  additions to medical claims reserves  additional allowances for uncollectible receivables  recognition of losses on certain contracts  and delays in the implementation of certain integration activities 
pharmaceutical services pharmaceutical services revenues continue to exhibit sustained growth 
this growth is entirely internal and has not been supplemented by acquisitions 
key factors contributing to this growth include high customer retention  additional penetration of retained customers  new customer contracts and drug cost inflation 
these growth factors were partially offset in  and by selective non renewal of certain accounts not meeting threshold profitability levels 
the preponderance of pharmaceutical services revenue is earned on a fee for service basis through contracts covering one to three year periods 
revenues for selected types of services are earned based on a percentage of savings achieved or on a per enrollee or per member basis  however  these revenues are not material to total revenues 
operating income experienced accelerated growth in and  and margins decreased slightly from in to in operating margin fell to in  due almost entirely to a million loss recognized on a risk share contract 
this particular contract is the only significant risk share contract to which the pharmaceutical services division is a party 
operating income and margins in were enhanced by reduced information systems costs achieved through renegotiations of a contract with an outsource service vendor  continued improvements in the acquisition costs of drugs  increased penetration of higher margin value oriented services and an overall reduction in selling and administrative expenses 
contract medical services the contract medical services division includes team health  which manages one of the largest hospital based physician groups in the country  and government services  one of the largest correctional and government services managed care delivery businesses 
these groups produced combined contract medical services revenue of million in team health organizes and manages physicians and other healthcare professionals engaged in the delivery of emergency  radiology and teleradiology services  hospital based primary care and temporary staffing and support services to hospitals  clinics  managed care organizations and physician groups throughout the united states 
government services provides similar services to medical facilities at correctional institutions and department of defense facilities 
as of december   the company had  physicians in states affiliated with its contract medical services division 
team health 
since becoming part of medpartners as a result of the ppsi merger in  team health has grown into one of the nation s largest providers of hospital based physician management services 
team health s growth is based upon a strategy of seeking out high quality  regional hospital based physician management groups for affiliation 
beginning in  team health acquired regional groups in new jersey emergency physician associates  florida the emergency associates for medicine and sheer  ahearn and associates and ohio emergency professional services 
team health also assumed management responsibility for a hospital based group that was already part of ppsi in washington northwest emergency physicians prior to ppsi s acquisition of team health 
in  team health continued to grow by making significant inroads into the strategically important california market with the acquisition of quantum plus  followed several months later by the acquisition of fischer mangold 
during  medpartners acquired inphynet and team health assumed responsibility for management of the hospital based division of inphynet 
team health also continued to expand its radiology line with the acquisition of reich  seidelmann  and janicki in ohio in late in addition to growth by acquisition of regional groups  team health aggressively seeks internal growth through sales of contract staffing opportunities as well as acquisition of smaller hospital based groups that roll in to existing regional offices 
team health has determined that timely and successful integration of acquired groups is critical when growing quickly  and places significant emphasis on integration efforts 
additionally  it is crucial to find ways to add value to the practices that choose to affiliate with team health 
local operations are coordinated out of the regional offices under the guidance of a senior physician leader  but all corporate support functions such as accounting and payroll are centralized in the team health corporate office 
common information platforms and databases are developed to facilitate the efficient capture of clinical and operating data 
the two major initiatives currently under way involve migration of all team health billing onto a common idx based billing system and creation of a company wide physician database and management system 
both initiatives are expected to be significantly complete by the end of management effort is also focused on evaluating the best clinical practices and exporting this knowledge throughout all the affiliates of team health in order to continually improve the quality of patient care provided by team health physicians 
attention is also focused on finding ways to reduce the cost of the clinical support services 
for example  during  the operations of quantum plus and fischer mangold were merged together and now operate from one regional office  thus saving a significant amount of duplicate overhead costs 
team health is currently affiliated with more than  emergency physicians and radiologists 
as of december   team health operates under hospital based contracts in states compared to contracts at december  team health revenue is driven primarily by the number of contracts with hospitals and other providers such as outpatient imaging centers that are staffed by hospital based physicians 
the revenue under these contracts is almost entirely fee for service 
accordingly  the capitated revenue of team health is minimal 
under the team health staffing contracts  revenue is generated either through direct billing of patients and payors  payments from the hospital or other provider  or a combination of both 
therefore  revenue can be affected by changes in patient volume and reimbursement levels from payors as well as changes in the contracted payment rate between the hospital or other providers and team health 
operating income and margins declined in primarily as a result of increased costs associated with the company s changes in malpractice programs and other matters associated with the acquisition of inphynet 
government services 
government services currently has affiliated physicians working in correctional facilities in states with approximately  globally capitated lives  making the company the nation s second largest provider of correctional medical services correctional care 
the contracts with correctional facilities are concentrated mainly on the east coast from florida to vermont  the midwest and in california 
another physicians work in military facilities  covering  annual patient visits military services 
the revenues under the correctional care contracts are generally capitated while some of the military services contacts reimburse the company on an hourly basis 
government services revenue has increased significantly in the last three years  primarily as a result of correctional care contract growth 
the company obtained contracts from year end through  and increased globally capitated lives from  in to  in the stated growth resulted from individual contract awards and the purchase of national health services  inc in july  which contributed million in revenue in international internationally  the company  through caremark  had established home care businesses in the united kingdom  canada  germany  france  the netherlands  puerto rico and japan 
the international operations are currently in the process of being sold 
the home infusion operations in germany  the netherlands and canada have been sold to fresenius a 
g 
other international operations in puerto rico  japan and the netherlands are being or have been sold to various parties 
revenue from international operations during totaled million 
discontinued operations during  caremark divested its caremark orthopedic services  inc subsidiary as well as its clozaril r patient management system  home infusion business and oncology management services business 
the company s consolidated financial statements present the operating income and net assets of these discontinued operations separately from continuing operations 
prior periods have been restated to conform with this presentation 
discontinued operations for reflect the net after tax gain on the disposal of the clozaril r patient management system  the home infusion business and a million after tax charge for the settlement related to the oig investigation discussed in note of the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
discontinued operations for reflects a million after tax charge related to settlements with private payors discussed in note of the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and an after tax gain on disposition of the nephrology services business  net of disposal costs  of million 
during the second quarter of  the company settled a dispute with coram health corporation arising from caremark s sale of its home infusion therapy business to coram  and  during the third quarter of  the company settled a class action lawsuit also related to caremark  both of which are discussed in note of the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a charge related to amounts due from and due to third parties as well as miscellaneous litigation  all of which resulted from operations previously owned by the company s caremark subsidiary 
results of operations for the years ended december  and for the year ended december   net revenue was  million  compared to  million for  an increase of 
the increase in net revenue resulted primarily from affiliations with new physician practices and the increase in pharmaceutical services net revenue  which accounted for million and million of the increase in net revenue  respectively 
the increase in pharmaceutical services net revenue is attributable to pharmaceutical price increases  the addition of new customers  further penetration of existing customers and the sale of new products 
the net loss was million for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  the company incurred a charge of million in related to restructuring and impairment 
see note of the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
changes in operations have previously been discussed for each division 
included in the pre tax loss for were merger expenses totaling million related to the business combinations with inphynet and several other entities  the major components of which are listed in note of the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf accounting for costs incurred in connection with a consulting contract or an internal project that combines business process reengineering and information technology eitf 
eitf requires process reengineering costs  as defined  which had been previously capitalized as part of an information technology project to be written off as a cumulative catch up adjustment in the fourth quarter of the company recorded a charge of million  net of tax of million  as a result of eitf the company incurred such costs primarily in connection with the process reengineering associated with the new operating systems installed for its pbm operations 
under statement of financial accounting standards  accounting for income taxes sfas  the company is required to record a net deferred tax asset for the future tax benefits of tax loss and tax credit carryforwards  as well as for other temporary differences  if realization of such benefits is more likely than not 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management has considered reversing deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies 
however  the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible and net operating losses can be carried forward 
management believes  considering all available information  including the company s history of earnings from continuing operations after adjustments for nonrecurring items  restructuring charges  permanent differences and other appropriate adjustments and after considering appropriate tax planning strategies  it is more likely than not that the company will generate sufficient taxable income in the appropriate carryforward periods to realize the million in net deferred tax assets related to net operating losses and future deductible temporary differences of which million was recognized in fiscal year includes the current tax benefit from discontinued operations of million and the tax benefit from the change in accounting methods of million 
the total net deferred tax assets both current and noncurrent have been reduced to the amount management considers realizable by establishing valuation allowances aggregating million 
the valuation allowances have been established due to the uncertainty associated with forecasting future income 
the valuation allowance also includes million related to certain net operating losses of non consolidated entities that can only offset future taxable income generated by those entities 
while management expects the company to be profitable  future levels of operating income are dependent upon general economic conditions  including competitive pressures on sales and profit margins  and other factors beyond the company s control 
management has considered these factors in reaching its conclusion that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient to utilize certain net operating loss carryforwards and other temporary differences prior to their expiration 
results of operations for the years ended december  and for the year ended december   net revenue was  million  compared to  million for  an increase of 
the increase in net revenue resulted primarily from affiliations with new physician practices and the increase in pbm net revenue  which accounted for million and million of the increase in net revenue  respectively 
the most significant physician practice acquisition during this period was the cigna medical group which was acquired in january this acquisition accounted for of the new practice revenue 
the increase in pbm net revenue is attributable to pharmaceutical price increases  the addition of new customers  further penetration of existing customers and the sale of new products 
operating income for the ppm and pbm services areas increased and  respectively  for compared to this growth was the result of higher net revenues in both areas and increases in operating margins resulting from the spreading of fixed overhead expenses over a larger revenue base and continued integration of operations in the ppm services area 
operating income and margins declined in the corresponding periods for the therapeutic services area as a result of lower volumes in the hemophilia business and continued pricing pressures for growth hormone products 
included in the pre tax loss for were merger expenses totaling million related to the business combinations with caremark  ppsi and several other entities  the major components of which are listed in note of the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
phycor and america service group inc 
merger agreements and subsequent terminations on october   the boards of directors of the company and phycor  inc unanimously approved a merger agreement under which phycor would acquire the company  with the company s stockholders receiving shares of phycor common stock for each share of the company s common stock 
on january   it was announced that the merger agreement had been terminated by mutual agreement 
on october   the company announced that it entered into an agreement to acquire america service group inc asg in a stock transaction valued at approximately million 
on february   it was announced that the merger agreement had been terminated by mutual consent of both parties and that a release and settlement agreement had been executed 
due to the exchange of confidential information  the settlement agreement contains customary non competition and non solicitation provisions and provides for the payment of certain expenses and costs by the company 
other matters year compliance 
the company has assessed the potential impact and costs of addressing the year issue and is in the process of implementing a plan of action to address the year issue 
this plan of action is a significant undertaking which is expected to require a significant amount of time and attention of senior management and other personnel to resolve 
the company estimates that the total cost of all of the work to be carried out to resolve its year issue will be approximately million over the years and of this amount  approximately million was work already budgeted without regard to the year issue 
thus the incremental costs of the company s efforts to address the year issue will be approximately million 
the company s current plan of action projects that the program to be carried out will be completed sometime in mid  however  there can be no assurance that the program will be implemented as planned and that there will not be adverse effects on the company s operations  financial condition and results of operations not currently anticipated in addressing the year issue 
the year issue is also expected to affect the systems of various entities with which the company interacts  including payors  suppliers and vendors 
there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely corrected  or that a failure by another company s systems to be year compliant would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
eitf in  the emerging issues task force of the financial accounting standards board issued eitf concerning the consolidation of physician practice revenues 
ppms will be required to consolidate financial information of a physician practice where the ppm acquires a controlling financial interest in the practice through the execution of a contractual management agreement even though the ppm does not own a controlling equity interest in the physician practice 
eitf outlines six requirements for establishing a controlling financial interest 
eitf is effective for the company s financial statements for the year ended december  the company does not believe that the implementation of eitf will have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
factors that may affect future results the future operating results and financial condition of the company are dependent on the company s ability to market its services profitably  successfully increase market share and manage expense growth relative to revenue growth 
the future operating results and financial condition of the company may be affected by a number of additional factors  including the company s growth strategy  which involves the ability to raise the capital required to support growth  competition for expansion opportunities  integration risks and dependence on hmo enrollee growth  efforts to control healthcare costs  exposure to professional liability  and pharmacy licensing  healthcare reform and government regulation 
changes in one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the future operating results and financial condition of the company 
the company completed its acquisition of caremark in september there are various caremark legal matters which  if materially adversely determined  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results and financial condition
