item a 
quantitative and qualitative analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
an important component of the bank s asset liability management policy includes examining the interest rate sensitivity of its assets and liabilities and monitoring the expected effects of interest rate changes on its net portfolio value 
an asset or liability is interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
if the bank s assets mature or reprice more quickly or to a greater extent than its liabilities  the bank s net portfolio value and net interest income would tend to increase during periods of rising interest rates but decrease during periods of falling interest rates 
conversely  if the bank s assets mature or reprice more slowly or to a lesser extent than its liabilities  its net portfolio value and net interest income would tend to decrease during periods of rising interest rates but increase during periods of falling interest rates 
the bank s policy has been to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in the historical business of savings associations  the origination of long term loans funded by short term deposits  by pursuing certain strategies designed to decrease the vulnerability of its earnings to material and prolonged changes in interest rates 
a key component of the bank s strategy in managing interest rate risk is to emphasize the origination of adjustable rate mortgage loans 
as of december   approximately of the bank s portfolio of one to four family mortgage loans had adjustable rates 
management believes it is critical to manage the relationship between interest rates and the effect on the bank s net portfolio value npv 
this approach calculates the difference between the present value of expected cash flows from assets and the present value of expected cash flows from liabilities  as well as cash flows from off balance sheet contracts 
the bank manages assets and liabilities within the context of the marketplace  regulatory limitations and within limits established by its board of directors on the amount of change in npv which is acceptable given certain interest rate changes 
the following table presents an analysis prepared by baxter capital management bcm  the bank s investment advisors  of the bank s interest rate risk as measured by changes in npv for instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in the yield curve up and down basis points  as of september  to estimate the npv of mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities  the bcm model utilizes various price indications and prepayment rates 
on september   these price indications varied from to for fixed rate mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities and varied from to for adjustable rate mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities 
prepayment rates ranged from to for fixed rate mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities and ranged from to for adjustable rate mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities 
to estimate the npv of certificates of deposit cd s  the bcm model utilizes price indications given specific information about the cd s yield  remaining maturity and compounding 
on september   price indications varied from to for cd s 
to estimate price indications of savings deposit accounts with no specific maturity  the bcm model utilizes a regression model of consumer responses to spreads between market rates and deposit rates and a regression model of institutional deposit rate responses to market rates 
on september   money market deposit account price indications varied from to

this hypothetical increase in interest rates would also result in a basis point or decrease in the ratio of the net portfolio value to the present value of the bank s assets 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methods of analysis presented above 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates could likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
senior management regularly monitors the bank s interest rate risk position and employs various strategies to control its exposure to interest rate risk 
the bank s primary method of controlling market risk exposure is to actively adjust the composition and pricing of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities
