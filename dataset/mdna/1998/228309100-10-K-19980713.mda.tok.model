erp software from october through december  the company conducted an assessment of its computer applications and systems in order to determine whether existing systems were sufficient to meet the company s future business information needs 
as a result  the company decided to install new enterprise resource planning erp software programs 
the erp programs are expected to replace substantially all of the company s existing applications software and to result in significant improvements in the functionality and efficiency of the company s business processes 
from january through march  the company developed a more detailed assessment of its current business processes and systems  identified potentially appropriate software packages  prepared requests for proposals  interviewed software vendors and evaluated alternatives 
all costs and expenses associated with this process were expensed as incurred 
in april  the company selected its erp vendor and began to develop implementation schedules 
the company presently estimates that the erp systems will be implemented at the parent company over a period of eighteen months at a total cost of million  of which million is expected to be capitalized 
of the total amount  million is expected to be expended in the fiscal year ended march   and million is expected to be expended in the fiscal year ended april  following such implementation  the company expects to develop budgets for extending the new systems to its operating subsidiaries 
year issue in the latter portion of the s  an issue affecting most companies has emerged regarding the ability of computer applications and systems to properly interpret dates later than december  this issue arises because  until recently  many computer applications were written using only the two rightmost digits to define the applicable year 
accordingly  when the need arises to enter a date after december   it is unclear how any particular application will interpret the digits unless corrective measures are taken  applications that are not year compliant may create erroneous results or  in the worst case  fail to operate 
prior to its decision to install new erp software  the company had begun investigating the impact of the year on its operations 
the erp vendor has advised the company that the software selected for implementation is year compliant 
because the company expects to complete its conversion to the new software at the parent company before any year issues arise  the company has greatly reduced the effort needed to correct existing programs 
the company intends to review the progress of its erp conversion project in september to determine whether it should begin to execute a contingency plan under which certain of the programs currently in use will be assessed and  if necessary  upgraded to become year compliant 
both internal and external resources will be utilized to make any such assessment  to make necessary modifications and to test the results 
in addition  the company has begun communicating with others with whom it does business to determine their year compliance readiness and the extent to which the company is vulnerable to any third party year issues 
all costs associated with year compliance activities have been expensed as incurred 
the total cost to the company of these year compliance activities has not been and is not expected to be material to its financial position or results of operations in any given year
