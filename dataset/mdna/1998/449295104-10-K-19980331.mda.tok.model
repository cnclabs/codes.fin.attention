overview the company is developing and commercializing proprietary pharmaceutical candidates for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and other serious medical conditions by understanding the underlying mechanisms and identifying the molecular entities involved 
the company s strategy is to identify therapeutic targets through an understanding of inflammation at the molecular level 
the company is developing pharmaceutical products that address important cellular and molecular mechanisms in three separate  yet interrelated  areas of the inflammatory process directed cell movement  the inhibition of proinflammatory mediators and intracellular signal transduction 
each of these different mechanisms may provide broad opportunities in the treatment of chronic diseases that have inflammatory components  such as multiple sclerosis ms  and in the treatment of acute inflammatory conditions  such as those associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome ards  hemorrhagic shock and myocardial infarction 
in addition  the company s other programs have yielded additional approaches that may be useful in treating cardiovascular diseases and cancer 
the company believes that its discoveries will allow it to develop novel therapeutics that are more selective in their activities than existing drugs 
during  the company initiated a phase clinical trial with hufg in patients with trauma induced hemorrhagic shock and continued the phase evaluation of hufg 
a phase clinical trial of hufg for acute exacerbations of ms was initiated in during  the company continued its phase clinical trial of hufg for acute exacerbations of ms and commenced two phase clinical trials of hufg for the treatment of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke 
in  the company began a phase clinical trial of rpaf ah in healthy volunteers 
in  the company began two phase clinical trials of rpaf ah for the treatment of asthma and ards 
additionally  in the company completed preclinical development of icm to allow for the commencement of phase clinical trials of icm in for the treatment of psoriasis  trials which continued through in early the company announced the initiation of a phase clinical trial overseas of ic in patients with male erectile dysfunction med and two expanded phase clinical trials of hufg for the treatment of hemorrhagic shock and myocardial infarction 
in addition in early  the company completed patient enrollment in two separate phase clinical trials of rpaf ah in asthma and ards 
in february  the company and suntory limited of japan suntory formed a new joint venture company  suncos corporation suncos to develop and commercialize rpaf ah 
in forming suncos  the company granted a license for the rpaf ah technology to suncos  and suntory made an initial capital contribution of million 
also in  icos clinical partners  lp the partnership  an affiliate of the company  completed the sale to private investors of interests in the partnership 
the sale will result in net proceeds to the partnership of approximately million 
approximately million  before payment of offering costs  was paid to the partnership at closing of the sale of the partnership units and the balance to be paid in installments over a three year period 
net proceeds from the sale will be used to fund the continued development by the company pursuant to the terms of a product development agreement between the company and the partnership of products based on hufg  rpaf ah and icm the partnership products 
the company had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  the company s results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and will depend  among other factors  on the timing of certain expenses  payments received on certain research collaborations  and the progress of the company s research and development efforts 
the company expects increased expenditures in and subsequent years as it expands the clinical trials being conducted on the product candidates hufg  ic  icm  rpaf ah and other potential product candidates 
some of these costs will be reimbursed by suncos and by the partnership 
in addition  the company took over development of all compounds resulting from the company s collaboration with glaxo wellcome and anticipates initiating additional clinical trials of the compounds for potential use in treating a number of medical indications  including med 
the company anticipates expanding preclinical research and other development activities for additional potential products and commencing clinical trials on those deemed most promising in the future 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue for the year ended december  totaled million and consisted of million from the partnership  million in cost reimbursement revenue from suncos  and million received under the company s research and development agreement with abbott laboratories 
the revenue from the partnership included both a one time license fee as well as cost reimbursement for development costs incurred by the company on behalf of the partnership 
revenue for the year ended december  was million  and consisted entirely of payments received under the company s agreement with abbott laboratories 
total operating expenses for increased to million from million in research and development expense increased to million in from million in  due primarily to costs related to the progression of clinical trials for hufg  rpaf ah  icm and ic  and the expansion of other product development efforts 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  due primarily to increased administrative activities and personnel to support increased research and development activity 
investment income for was million compared with million in the company s net loss decreased to million in compared with a net loss of million in the decrease in net loss was due primarily to revenue recognized from suncos and the partnership  including a one time license fee and cost reimbursement 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue for the years ended december  and resulted entirely from the company s research and development agreement with abbott laboratories  which was initiated in april  and totaled million in compared with million in total operating expenses in increased to million from million in research and development expense increased to million in from million in  due primarily to costs related to ongoing clinical trials and related product development efforts 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in investment income in was million compared with million in the increase was due primarily to higher average cash balances as a result of the company s equity offering in may the company s net loss increased to million in compared with a net loss of million for  due primarily to costs related to ongoing clinical trials and related product development efforts 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations since inception through private and public sales of the company s common stock  investment income  revenue from research collaborations  license payments  grants and capital lease obligations 
at december   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents  investment securities and interest receivable  a decrease of million from december  this decrease is attributable primarily to ongoing costs associated with clinical trials for hufg  rpaf ah  ic and icm  production of materials to support these and future clinical trials  regulatory submissions and expansion of the company s other research and development programs 
these costs were partially offset by increased revenues from suncos and the partnership 
through december   the company had invested a total of million in production facilities  laboratory and computer equipment  furniture  buildings and leasehold improvements 
in addition  the company has invested million in land for future facilities expansion 
on august   the partnership completed the sale to private investors of interests in the partnership 
the sale will result in net proceeds to the partnership of approximately million 
approximately million  before payment of offering costs  was paid to the partnership at closing of the sale of the partnership units and the balance to be paid in installments over a three year period 
in connection with the offering of the partnership units  the company issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of approximately million shares of the company s common stock 
net proceeds from the offering will be used by the partnership to fund continued development by the company of the partnership products pursuant to the terms of the product development agreement 
while the partnership will reimburse the company for certain costs associated with the development of these compounds  it is unlikely that all such costs will be reimbursed 
certain rights relating to the partnership products were licensed by the partnership from the company in connection with the sale of the partnership units 
the company anticipates that its operating expenses will continue to increase during and subsequent years as it adds the personnel and facilities associated with advancing several potential product candidates through development and clinical trials 
foreseeable incremental costs may include  but are not limited to  those associated with the company s own product development  preclinical studies and clinical trials  patent filings and administrative activities 
the company may also incur costs and make capital contributions under its joint venture agreement with suntory related to its obligations to develop rpaf ah 
under provisions of the development agreement with suncos  the company will be reimbursed for certain of these costs  however  there can be no assurance that all such costs will be reimbursed 
the company may also incur costs associated with the development of the partnership products pursuant to the terms of the product development agreement entered into with the partnership 
the company intends to use its financial resources for ongoing and future clinical trials of certain of its current product candidates  including hufg  rpaf ah  icm  and ic  expansion of preclinical research and development activities for additional potential product candidates and the initiation of clinical trials for those product candidates deemed most promising  expansion of the company s facilities and general corporate purposes 
the company anticipates that its existing cash  including interest income from cash investments and anticipated payments from abbott laboratories  suncos and the partnership  will be adequate to satisfy its cash requirements for approximately nine months 
however  the amounts and timing of expenditures will depend on the progress of ongoing research and development  the rate at which operating losses are incurred  the execution of development and licensing agreements with potential corporate partners  the company s development of products  the food and drug administration fda regulatory process  and other factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
the company has been successful in negotiating collaborations and joint development agreements with other parties where the work and strategies of the other parties complement those of the company 
in some instances  these relationships may involve commitments by the company to fund some or all of certain development programs 
although corporate collaborations and joint ventures have provided cost reimbursement revenue to the company in the past  there can be no assurance that such funds will be available to the company in the future 
the company intends to expand its operations and hire the additional personnel deemed necessary to continue development of its current portfolio of product candidates in clinical trials  as well as continuing discovery and preclinical research to identify additional potential drug candidates 
the company anticipates that expansion of these activities will increase operating expenses in future quarters 
further  incremental expenditures will be required for additional laboratory  production and office facilities to accommodate activities and the personnel associated with this increased development activity 
as such  the company will need to raise substantial additional funds to conduct its research and development activities  preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to bring its product candidates to market and to establish marketing capabilities if and when a product candidate is ready for commercialization 
there can be no assurance that additional funds will be available as needed or on terms that are acceptable to the company 
insufficient funding will require the company to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of its research and development activities  planned clinical trials and administrative programs 
the amounts and timing of operating expenditures will depend on the progress of ongoing research and development of the company s potential products  as well as the activities of corporate collaborators and joint venture partners related to collaborative research and development activities  the fda regulatory process and other factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
year the company has conducted a review of its computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the year issue and is developing an implementation plan to resolve the issue 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two  rather than four  digits to define the applicable year 
unless corrected  those systems that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  potentially resulting in system failures or miscalculations 
the company presently believes that  with certain modifications to existing software and selective conversion to new software  the year problem will not pose significant operational problems for the company s computer systems as so modified and converted and that the cost of such modifications will be minimal 
the company anticipates that all necessary modifications and conversions of its systems will be completed by the end of
