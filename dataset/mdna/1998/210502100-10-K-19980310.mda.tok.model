item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of the financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial data included elsewhere in this report 
overview the company specializes in the business of purchasing  selling and servicing retail automobile installment sales contracts originated by dealers in the sale of new and used automobiles  light trucks and passenger vans and has done so since its inception on march  through its purchases  the company provides indirect financing to borrowers with limited credit histories  low incomes or past credit problems 
the company generates earnings primarily from the gains recognized on the sale or securitization of its contracts  servicing fees earned on contracts sold  and interest earned on contracts held for sale 
earnings from gains on sale  interest and servicing fees for the year ended december   were million  million  and million  respectively 
such earnings for the year ended december   were million  million  and million  respectively 
for the nine month period ended december   such earnings were million  million and million  respectively 
the company s income is affected by losses incurred on contracts  whether such contracts are held for sale or have been sold in securitizations 
the company s cash requirements have been and will continue to be significant 
net cash used in operating activities for the year  ended december  and  and the nine month period ended december  were million  million and million  respectively 
the company purchases contracts with the primary intention of reselling them to investors as asset backed securities through securitizations 
the securitizations are generally structured as follows first  the company sells a portfolio of contracts to a wholly owned subsidiary sps which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling the company s contracts 
the sps then transfers the same contracts to either a grantor trust or an owner trust the trust  and the trust in turn issues interest bearing asset backed securities the certificates generally in an amount equal to the aggregate principal balance of the contracts 
the company typically sells these contracts at face value and without recourse except that the normal representations and warranties provided by the dealer to the company are similarly provided by the company to the trust 
one or more investors purchase these certificates  the proceeds from the sale of the certificates are then used to purchase the contracts from the company 
in addition  the company provides a credit enhancement for the benefit of the investors in the form of an initial cash deposit to a specific account spread account held by the trust 
the spread account is required by the servicing agreement to be maintained at specified levels 
at the closing of each securitization  the company removes from its consolidated balance sheet the contracts held for sale and adds to its consolidated balance sheet i the cash received and ii the estimated fair value of the portion of the contracts retained from the securitizations residuals  which consist of a the cash held in the spread account and b the net interest receivables nirs 
nirs represent the discounted cash flows to be received by the trust in the future 
the excess of the cash received and the assets retained by the company over the carrying value of the contracts sold  less transaction costs  equals the net gain on sale of contracts recorded by the company 
the company is not aware of an active market for the purchase or sale of residuals  and accordingly  the company determines the estimated fair value of the residuals by discounting the expected excess cash flows released from the spread account the cash out method using a discount rate which the company believes is commensurate with the risks involved 
the company has utilized an effective discount rate of approximately on the estimated cash flows released from the spread account to value the residuals 
the company receives periodic base servicing fees for the servicing and collection of the contracts 
in addition  the company is entitled to the cash flows from the trusts that represent collections on the contracts in excess of the amounts required to pay the certificate principal and interest  the base servicing fees and certain other consumer portfolio services  inc form k december  fees such as trustee and custodial fees 
at the end of each collection period  the aggregate cash collections from the contracts are allocated first to the base servicing fees and certain other fees such as trustee and custodial fees for the period  then to the certificateholders for interest at the pass through rate on the certificates plus principal as defined in the servicing agreements 
if the amount of cash required for the above allocations exceeds the amount collected during the collection period  the shortfall is drawn from the spread account 
if the cash collected during the period exceeds the amount necessary for the above allocations  and there is no shortfall in the related spread account  the excess is released to the company 
if the spread account balance is not at the required credit enhancement level the excess cash collected is retained in the spread account until the specified level is achieved 
cash held in the various spread accounts is invested in either high quality liquid investment securities  as specified in the securitization agreements or  pursuant to certain securitization agreements  is used to make accelerated principal paydowns on the certificates to create excess collateral over collateralization or oc account  which is held by the trusts on behalf of the company as the residual holder 
the specified credit enhancement levels are defined in the servicing agreements as the spread account balance  expressed generally as a percentage of the current collateral principal balance 
the spread account includes both the cash and oc accounts 
the annual percentage rate apr on the contracts is relatively high in comparison to the pass through rate on the certificates  accordingly  the residuals described above can be a significant asset of the company 
in determining the value of the residuals described above  the company must estimate the future rates of prepayments  delinquencies  defaults and default loss severity as they impact the amount and timing of the estimated cash flows 
the company estimates prepayments by evaluating historical prepayment performance of comparable contracts and the impact of trends in the industry 
the company has used a constant prepayment estimate of 
the company estimates defaults and default losses using available historical loss data for comparable contracts and the specific characteristics of the contracts purchased by the company 
in addition  the company has used default losses of to as a percentage of the original principal balance over the life of the contracts 
in future periods  the company will recognize additional revenue from the residuals if the actual performance of the contracts is higher than the original estimate or the company may increase the estimated fair value of the residuals 
if the actual performance of the contracts is lower than the original estimate  then an adjustment to the carrying value of the residuals may be required if the estimated fair value of the residuals is less than its carrying value 
for the year ended december  the trusts received million in cash flows which was  in excess of the cash flows estimated to be received by the trusts during this period

during eight of the trusts incurred cumulative net losses as a percentage of the original contract balance in excess of the predetermined levels specified in the respective securitization agreements 
accordingly  pursuant to the securitization agreements  the specified credit enhancement levels were increased

the securitization agreements call for the requisite levels of the various spread accounts to increase if the related receivables experience delinquencies  repossessions or net losses in excess of certain predetermined levels

as of december   the spread accounts for eight of the company s securitized pools were at higher than original requisite levels due to delinquency  repossession or net loss performance 
such spread account balances therefore included approximately million more than would have been required at the original requisite levels

the pens are long term subordinated debt instruments issued in a registered public offering in april after deduction of underwriting commissions  the proceeds of that offering were million 
the pens have a fixed coupon rate of interest per annum  payable monthly beginning may  the fixed interest rate payable on the pens may be considered comparable to the rising interest rate payable on the million of debt securities rising interest subordinated redeemable securities or risrs that the company issued in december the risrs interest rate was per annum throughout and will rise by 
per annum in each consumer portfolio services  inc form k december  calendar year through  and then by an additional 
per annum for the final year prior to maturity on december  the risrs may be redeemed without premium at any time after january   and the pens may be redeemed without premium at any time after april  the pens are also partially convertible into equity 
at maturity or earlier redemption of the pens  the holders thereof will have the option to convert of the principal amount into common stock of the company  at a conversion rate of per share 
the rpl is long term subordinated debt representing million borrowed in june from sfsc 
the rpl has a fixed rate of interest of per annum  payable monthly beginning july the company may pre pay the rpl without penalty at any time on or after june  at maturity or early repayment of the rpl  the holder thereof will have the option to convert of the principal amount into common stock of the company  at a conversion rate of per share 
in conjunction with the rpl  in may  the company entered into two additional transactions  i the company purchased million of preferred stock of stanwich holdings  with dividends cumulative at the rate of per annum and redeemable at an aggregate price of million  plus accrued dividends  and ii the company borrowed million with interest at per annum under a day related party loan from sfsc 
in august  the company received million in redemption of the preferred stock of stanwich holdings and repaid the day related party loan in its entirety 
the company anticipates that the proceeds from the pens  the rpl  funds available under the two warehouse lines  proceeds from the sale of contracts and cash from operations will be sufficient to satisfy the company s estimated cash requirements for the next twelve months  assuming that the company continues to have a means by which to sell its warehoused contracts 
if for any reason the company is unable to sell its contracts  or if the company s available cash otherwise proves to be insufficient to fund operations because of future changes in the industry  general economic conditions  unanticipated increases in expenses  or other factors  the company may be required to seek additional funding 
in addition to capital required for the company s existing business and its growth  the company may require additional capital resources if it should choose to expand its operations by acquisition of other businesses 
although the company has no commitments to make any acquisition  it does regularly review proposals to make acquisitions in the financial services field 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing  if required  will be available to the company  nor can there be any assurance as to the cost of any such financing that may be available 
the company is exploring the possibility of issuing additional debt to provide additional capital  but has no commitment to do so 
in january  the company acquired a company engaged in the equipment leasing business 
any material growth in that subsidiary s business will require significant capital resources  to allow that subsidiary to purchase equipment for lease 
in march  the leasing company obtained a million line of credit to purchase equipment for lease
