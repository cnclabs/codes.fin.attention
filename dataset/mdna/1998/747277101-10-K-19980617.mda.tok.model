item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed hereunder  in risk factors or item  as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report 
overview qlogic corporation is a leading designer and supplier of semiconductor and board level i o products 
the company s products provide a high performance interface between computer systems and their attached data storage peripherals  such as hard disk and tape drives  removable disk drives  cd rom drives and raid subsystems 
qlogic provides complete i o technology solutions by designing and marketing single chip controller and adapter board products for both sides of the computer peripheral device interlink  or bus 
historically  the company has targeted the high performance sector of the i o market  focusing primarily on the scsi industry standard 
the company is utilizing its i o expertise to develop products for emerging i o standards  such as fibre channel 
fibre channel is experiencing early industry acceptance as a higher performance solution that maintains signal integrity while allowing for increased connectivity between a computer system and its data storage peripherals 
the company s products include semiconductors for computer peripheral devices and semiconductors and adapter boards for computer systems 
the company s peripheral products are comprised of the fas and tec product lines  and its computer systems products are comprised of the isp and host board product lines 
the company s products have traditionally been based on the scsi standard  but during fiscal and the company introduced products for the fibre channel and ide i o standards 
net revenues from the company s computer systems products are relatively less subject to fluctuations than those from the company s peripheral device products due to generally longer product life cycles 
in addition  the company s computer systems products are manufactured to meet the specific solution needs of its oem customers and  as a result  tend to carry higher gross margins 
the company is attempting to increase its proportionate sales of computer systems products 
the company is also identifying new sectors of the peripheral device market with the goal of expanding its business 
for example  the company is leveraging its i o technological expertise to develop high performance ide based peripheral controllers 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of products at the time of shipment 
the company currently sells a majority of its products directly to oems such as sun microsystems  inc  fujitsu limited  digital equipment corporation  and hitachi america  ltd 
the company also sells its products through a network of independent manufacturers representatives and regional and international distributors 
the company believes that by establishing and developing direct relationships with leading oems within the computer industry  the company will have greater opportunities to expand its scsi based sales and to leverage these relationships into design wins for its ide and fibre channel products 
the company believes that sales to oems result in lower product return rates and require a smaller customer support infrastructure 
however  there is a limited number of potential oem customers 
as a result  the loss of a large oem customer would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
also  the company has historically experienced seasonality resulting in somewhat lower net revenues in its first fiscal quarter as compared to the previous quarter  which the company believes is due to reduced spending by its oem customers in advance of scheduled production slowdowns in the forthcoming summer months 
the company also generates revenues by licensing certain of its technology 
license revenues are recognized when earned and receipt is assured 
the company is the successor to the emulex micro devices division of emulex corporation emulex 
on february   emulex declared a special dividend consisting of the distribution the distribution to its stockholders of all outstanding shares of common stock of qlogic 
the purpose of the distribution was to enable the company to gain independent access to equity markets so that it may use its capital stock as a source of funding 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain income and expense items expressed in absolute terms and as a percentage of the company s net revenues 
fiscal year ended march  march  march  net revenues    cost of sales    gross profit    operating expenses engineering and development    selling and marketing    general and administrative    total operating expenses    operating income    net revenues the company s net revenues are derived primarily from the sale of scsi based i o products 
license fees also contribute to the company s net revenues 
net revenues for fiscal increased million or from fiscal to million 
the increase was the result of an million increase in sales of the host board product line  combined with a million increase in sales in the fas product line 
a partially offsetting decline of million occurred in license fees 
net revenues for fiscal increased million or from fiscal to million 
the increase was primarily the result of an increase in sales of the tec  host board and isp product lines and increased license fees 
a partially offsetting decline in sales of million occurred in the fas product line 
export revenues for fiscal increased million or from fiscal  to approximately million  primarily due to increased sales to customers in europe  along with smaller increases from southeast asia 
export revenues for fiscal increased million or from fiscal  to approximately million  primarily due to increased sales to customers in japan 
recently  the asian markets have suffered property price deflation 
this asset deflation has taken place especially in countries that have had a collapse in both their currency and stock markets  such as japan 
these deflationary pressures have reduced liquidity in the banking systems of the affected countries and  when coupled with spare industrial production capacity  could lead to widespread financial difficulty among the companies in this region 
international sales primarily to the pacific rim countries of the company s products accounted for approximately   and and   and  of net revenues for fiscal years  and  respectively 
international sales are denominated in us dollars 
the company does not expect the uncertainty in the southeast asia foreign currency markets to have a material adverse effect on the results of the company s operations 
a small number of customers account for a substantial portion of the company s net revenues  and the company expects that a limited number of customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of the company s net revenues for the foreseeable future 
the company s six largest customers in each respective period accounted for approximately  and of the company s net revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
for fiscal  fujitsu limited  sun microsystems  inc and digital equipment corporation accounted for approximately  and of the company s net revenues  respectively 
for fiscal  sun microsystems  inc  tokyo electron limited  and fujitsu limited accounted for approximately   and of the company s net revenues  respectively 
for fiscal  tokyo electron limited  sun microsystems  inc and avex electronics  inc 
accounted for approximately  and of the company s net revenues  respectively 
the company believes that its major customers continually evaluate whether or not to purchase products from alternate or additional sources 
additionally  customers economic and market conditions frequently change 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that a major customer will not reduce  delay or eliminate its purchases from the company 
any such reduction  delay or loss of purchases could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
cost of sales cost of sales consists primarily of raw materials including wafers and completed chips from third party manufacturers  assembly and test labor  overhead and warranty costs 
the cost of sales percentage for fiscal was  a decrease of from the prior fiscal year 
the percentage decrease was due to a shift in product mix to products with lower unit costs  as well as increased production volumes 
additionally  multiple disciplines within the company worked together to improve inventory management 
the cost of sales percentage for fiscal was  a decrease of from the prior fiscal year 
the percentage decrease was due to increased revenue from products that contain higher levels of integration and functionality and are generally associated with higher average selling prices and gross margins 
the company continued to focus on reducing component costs as well as implementing design efficiencies during fiscal the cost of sales percentage for fiscal was  an increase of over fiscal the increase in the cost of sales percentage was primarily due to inventory write down charges being higher in fiscal compared to the prior year 
the company s ability to maintain its current gross margin can be significantly affected by factors such as supply costs and  in particular  the cost of silicon wafers  the mix of products shipped  competitive price pressures  the timeliness of volume shipments of new products and the company s ability to achieve manufacturing cost reductions 
the company anticipates that it will be increasingly more difficult to reduce manufacturing costs 
in addition  the company believes the cost of sales percentage will be adversely impacted by sales of ide based products  which carry lower margins 
as a result  the company does not anticipate percentage cost of sales to decrease at a rate consistent with historic trends 
operating expenses engineering and development 
engineering and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  development related material  occupancy costs and depreciation 
for fiscal engineering and development expenditures increased by million from fiscal  primarily due to salary and occupancy expenses related to increased headcount 
the company expects that engineering and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in fiscal in fiscal  engineering and development expenditures increased by million from the prior fiscal year  primarily due to increased salary and occupancy expenses related to increased headcount 
in particular  the company significantly expanded its engineering staff in fiscal in connection with its development of fibre channel products 
in fiscal  engineering and development expenditures decreased by million from fiscal expenditures 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of sales commissions  salaries and other expenses for selling and marketing personnel  travel expenses and trade shows 
during fiscal  selling and marketing expenses increased by million compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of increased sales  as well as increases in advertising and trade show expenses 
the company expects that selling and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars in fiscal during fiscal  selling and marketing expenses decreased by million compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of reduced advertising and trade show expenses  due to the company s shift away from selling to resellers  which typically requires more advertising and other promotions 
the decrease in advertising cost was partially offset by an increase in marketing salaries 
in fiscal  selling and marketing expenses decreased by million compared to fiscal  primarily due to a reduction in advertising 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other expenses for corporate management  finance  accounting and human resources 
for fiscal  general and administrative expenses decreased by million due to reduced corporate administrative expenses 
for fiscal  general and administrative expenses increased million from the prior year  primarily due to expenses related to implementing a new computer system and salaries 
for fiscal year  general and administrative expenses decreased million compared to fiscal  primarily due to decreased bad debt expense 
interest income expense interest income  net of expense  increased million during fiscal from fiscal  due to larger balances of cash  cash equivalents  and investments 
in addition  the company continued to make payments to reduce its capital lease liabilities 
interest income  net of expense  for fiscal increased million from fiscal  due to larger balances of cash and cash equivalents and due to lower capital lease commitments outstanding 
interest income  net of expense  increased in fiscal to from a net expense of in fiscal income tax provision the company s effective tax rates were approximately   and  for fiscal years   and  respectively 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
statement  reporting comprehensive income 
the new statement is effective for both interim and annual periods for fiscal years beginning after december  adoption of this new standard will not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued statement  disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the new statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  adoption of this new standard will not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources for fiscal years  and the company s cash flow from operations have exceeded capital expenditures 
capital expenditures on property and equipment were million  million  and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
cash provided by operations was approximately million  million  and million for fiscal years   and  respectively 
the growth in cash provided by operations is primarily attributable to improved profitability  accounts receivable collection  inventory management  cash management and cost reductions in operations 
cash used in investing activities was approximately million  million  and million  in fiscal   and respectively  primarily reflecting investment of the proceeds of the secondary offering in fiscal and expenditures for property and equipment during fiscal  and cash provided by financing activities was approximately million for fiscal  which reflected the sale of  shares of common stock from which the company received net proceeds of million and exercise of stock options  offset in part by principal payments under capital leases 
cash used in financing activities  reflecting primarily principal payments under capital leases  was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
working capital at march  was million  as compared to million at march  at march   the company s principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of million  and investments of million 
in addition  the company has an unsecured line of credit of up to million with silicon valley bank 
the line of credit allows the company to borrow at the bank s prime rate 
there were no borrowings under the line of credit as of march  the line of credit with silicon valley bank expires july   and  although there can be no assurances  the company currently expects to renew this line of credit 
the company believes that existing cash and investment balances  facilities and equipment leases  cash flow from operating activities and its available line of credit will provide the company with sufficient funds to finance its operations for at least the next months 
year many existing computer systems and applications  and other control devices  use only two digits to identify a year in the date field  without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century 
as a result  such systems and applications could fail or create erroneous results unless corrected so that they can process data related to the year the company relies on its systems  applications and devices in operating and monitoring all major aspects of its business  including financial systems such as general ledger  accounts payable and payroll modules  customer services  infrastructure  embedded computer chips  networks and telecommunications equipment and end products 
the company is in the process of upgrading its software to address the year issue 
because a large portion of the company s software is obtained from its vendors on a non custom basis  the company believes that upgrades for its commercial programs are currently available 
the company currently estimates that the costs associated with the year issue  and the consequences of incomplete or untimely resolution of the year issue  will not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial position of the company in any given year 
the company also relies  directly and indirectly  on external systems of business enterprises such as customers  suppliers  creditors  financial organizations  and of governmental entities  both domestic and international  for accurate exchange of data 
even if the internal systems of the company are not materially affected by the year issue  the company could be affected through disruptions in the operation of the enterprises with which the company interacts 
despite the company s efforts to address the year impact on its internal systems and business operations  there can be no assurance that such impact will not result in a material disruption of its business or have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
risk factors except for the historical information contained herein  the information in this report constitutes forward looking statements 
when used in this report the words shall  should  forecast  all of  projected  believes  expects  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
in addition  the company may from time to time make oral forward looking statements 
the company wishes to caution readers that a number of important factors could cause results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below  as well as those discussed above or elsewhere in this report 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  fluctuations in sales and operating results from quarter to quarter 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its operating results are not necessarily meaningful  and that such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will maintain its current profitability in the future 
a significant portion of the company s net revenues in each fiscal quarter results from orders booked in that quarter 
in the past  a significant percentage of the company s quarterly bookings and sales to major customers occurred during the last month of the quarter  and there can be no assurance that this trend will not return in the future 
orders placed by major customers are typically based on their forecasted sales and inventory levels for the company s products 
changes in purchasing patterns by one or more of the company s major customers  customer order changes or rescheduling  gain or loss of significant customers  customer policies pertaining to desired inventory levels of the company s products  negotiations of rebates and extended payment terms  as well as changes in the ability of the company to anticipate in advance the mix of customer orders  could result in material fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
certain large oem customers may require the company to maintain higher levels of inventory as such customers attempt to minimize their own inventories 
in addition  the company must order its products and build inventory substantially in advance of product shipments  and because the markets for the company s products are subject to rapid technological and price changes  there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and produce excess or insufficient inventory of particular products 
to the extent the company produces excess or insufficient inventory or is required to hold excess inventory  the company s operating results could be adversely effected 
other factors that could cause the company s sales and operating results to vary significantly from period to period include the time  availability and sale of new products  seasonal oem customer demand  such as the decline experienced in the fiscal quarter ended june   changes in the mix of products having differing gross margins  variations in manufacturing capacities  efficiencies and costs  the availability and cost of components  including silicon wafers  warranty expenses  variations in product development and other operating expenses  and general economic and other conditions effecting the timing of customer orders and capital spending 
the company s quarterly results of operations are also influenced by competitive factors  including pricing and availability of the company s and its competitors products 
although the company does not maintain its own wafer manufacturing facility  a large portion of the company s expenses are fixed and difficult to reduce in a short period of time 
if net revenues do not meet the company s expectations  the company s fixed expenses would exacerbate the effect on net income of such shortfall in net revenues 
furthermore  announcements by the company  its competitors or others regarding new products and technologies could cause customers to defer or cancel purchases of the company s products 
order deferrals by the company s customers  delays in the company s introduction of new products and longer than anticipated design in cycles for the company s products have in the past adversely effected the company s quarterly results of operations 
due to all of the foregoing factors  as well as other unanticipated factors  it is likely that in some future quarter or quarters the company s operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially and adversely effected 
dependence on small number of customers a small number of customers account for a substantial portion of the company s net revenues  and the company expects that a limited number of customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of the company s net revenues for the foreseeable future 
the loss of any of the company s major customers would have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  a majority of the company s customers order the company s products through written purchase orders as opposed to long term supply contracts and  therefore  such customers are generally not obligated to purchase products from the company for any extended period 
major customers also have significant leverage over the company and may attempt to change the terms  including pricing  upon which the company and such customers do business  which could materially adversely effect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
as the company s oem customers are pressured to reduce prices as a result of competitive factors  the company may be required to contractually commit to price reductions for its products before it knows how  or if  cost reductions can be obtained 
if the company is unable to achieve such cost reductions  the company s gross margins could decline and such decline could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the company provides its major distributors and certain volume purchasers with price protection in the event that the company reduces the prices of its products 
while the company maintains reserves for such price protection  there can be no assurance that the impact of future price reductions by the company will not exceed the company s reserves in any specific fiscal period 
any price protection in excess of recorded reserves could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition the markets for both peripheral and host computer products are highly competitive and are characterized by short product life cycles  price erosion  rapidly changing technology  frequent product performance improvements and evolving industry standards 
competition typically occurs at the design stage  where the customer evaluates alternative design approaches 
because of shortened product life cycles and even shorter design in cycles  the company s competitors have increasingly frequent opportunities to achieve design wins in next generation systems 
a design win usually ensures a customer will purchase the product until a higher performance standard is available or a competitor can demonstrate a significant price performance advantage 
all of the company s products compete with products available from several companies  many of which have substantially greater research and development  long term guaranteed supply capacity  marketing and financial resources  manufacturing capability and customer support organizations than those of the company 
the company believes that its future operating results will depend  in part  upon its ability to continue to improve product and process technologies and develop new technologies in order to achieve or maintain the performance advantages of products and processes relative to competitors  to adapt products and processes to technological changes  and to identify and adopt emerging industry standards 
because of the complexity of its products  the company has experienced delays from time to time in completing products on a timely basis 
if the company is unable to design  develop and introduce competitive new products on a timely basis  its future operating results would be materially and adversely effected 
the company currently competes primarily with adaptec  inc and symbios logic  inc in the scsi sector of the i o market 
in the fibre channel sector of the i o market  the company expects to compete primarily with adaptec  inc  symbios logic  inc and hewlett packard company 
in the ide sector  the company expects to compete with adaptec  inc and cirrus logic  inc 
adaptec recently made a bid to acquire symbios 
the company may compete with some of its larger disk drive and computer systems customers  some of which have the capability to develop i o controller integrated circuits for use in their products 
at least one large oem customer in the past decided to vertically integrate and therefore ceased purchases from the company 
the company will need to continue to develop products appropriate to its markets to remain competitive as its competitors continue to introduce products with improved performance characteristics 
while the company continues to devote significant resources to research and development  there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful or that the company will develop and introduce new technology and products in a timely manner 
in addition  while relatively few competitors offer a full range of scsi and other i o products  additional domestic and foreign manufacturers may increase their presence in  and resources devoted to  these markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will compete successfully in the future 
dependence on wafer suppliers and other subcontractors the company currently relies on several independent foundries to manufacture its semiconductor products either in finished form or wafer form 
the company conducts business with its foundries through written purchase orders as opposed to long term supply contracts and  therefore  such foundries are generally not obligated to supply products to the company for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at any specified price  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order as may be accepted by a foundry 
to the extent a foundry terminates its relationship with the company or should the company s supply from a foundry be interrupted or terminated for any other reason  the company may not have a sufficient amount of time to replace the supply of products manufactured by that foundry 
until recently  there has been a worldwide shortage of advanced process technology foundry capacity 
the manufacture of semiconductor devices is subject to a wide variety of factors  including the availability of raw materials  the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  impurities in the materials used  and the performance of personnel and equipment 
the company is continuously evaluating potential new sources of supply 
however  the qualification process and the production ramp up for additional foundries has in the past taken  and could in the future take  longer than anticipated 
there can be no assurance that new supply sources will be able or willing to satisfy the company s wafer requirements on a timely basis or at acceptable quality or unit prices 
while the quality  yield and timeliness of wafer deliveries to date have been acceptable  there can be no assurance that manufacturing yield problems will not occur in the future 
the company is using multiple sources of supply for certain of its products  which may require the company s customers to perform separate product qualifications 
the company has not  however  developed alternate sources of supply for certain other products and its newly introduced products are typically produced initially by a single foundry until alternate sources can be qualified 
in particular  the company s integrated single chip fibre channel controller is manufactured by lsi logic and integrates lsi logic s transceiver technology 
in the event that lsi logic is unable or unwilling to satisfy the company s requirements for this technology  the company s marketing efforts related to fibre channel products would be delayed and  as such  its results of operations could be materially and adversely effected 
the requirement that a customer perform separate product qualifications or a customer s inability to obtain a sufficient supply of products from the company may cause that customer to satisfy its product requirements from the company s competitors  which would adversely effect the company s results of operations 
the company s ability to obtain satisfactory wafer and other supplies is subject to a number of other risks 
these risks include  without limit  that the company s suppliers may be subject to injunctions arising from alleged violations of third party intellectual property rights 
the enforcement of such an injunction could impede a supplier s ability to provide wafers  components or packaging services to the company 
in addition  the company s flexibility to move production of any particular product from one foundry to another can be limited in that such a move can require significant re engineering  which may take several quarters 
these efforts also divert engineering resources which otherwise could be dedicated to new product development  which would adversely effect new product development schedules 
accordingly  production may be constrained even though capacity is available at one or more foundries 
in addition  the company could encounter supply shortages if sales grow substantially 
the company uses domestic and offshore subcontractors for die assembly of its semiconductor products purchased in wafer form  and for assembly of its host adapter board products 
the company s reliance on independent subcontractors to provide these services involves a number of risks  including the absence of guaranteed capacity and reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and costs 
the company is also subject to the risks of shortages and increases in the cost of raw materials used in the manufacture or assembly of the company s products 
in addition  the company may receive orders for large volumes of products to be shipped within short periods  and the company may not have sufficient testing capacity to fill such orders 
constraints or delays in the supply of the company s products  whether because of capacity constraints  unexpected disruptions at the company s foundries or subcontractors  delays in obtaining additional production at the existing foundries or in obtaining production from new foundries  shortages of raw materials  or other reasons  could result in the loss of customers and other material adverse effects on the company s operating results  including those that may result should the company be forced to purchase products from higher cost foundries or pay expediting charges to obtain additional supply 
transactions to obtain manufacturing capacity  future capital needs although the company is currently not experiencing any difficulties in obtaining sufficient foundry capacity due to the current abundance of worldwide semiconductor fabrication capacity  the company and the semiconductor industry have in the past experienced shortages of available foundry capacity 
accordingly  in order to secure an adequate supply of wafers  especially wafers manufactured using advanced process technologies  the company may consider various possible transactions  including the use of take or pay contracts that commit the company to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods or equity investments in or advances to wafer manufacturing companies in exchange for guaranteed production capacity  or the formation of joint ventures to own and operate or construct foundries or to develop certain products 
any of these transactions would involve financial risk to the company and could require the company to commit substantial capital or provide technology licenses in return for guaranteed production capacity 
reliance on high performance computer and computer peripheral market a significant portion of the company s host adapter board products are currently used in high performance file servers  workstations and other office automation products 
the company s growth has been supported by increasing demand for sophisticated i o solutions which support database systems  servers  workstations  internet intranet applications  multimedia and telecommunications 
should there be a slowing in the growth of demand for such systems  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely effected 
as a supplier of controller products to manufacturers of computer peripherals such as disk drives and other data storage devices  a portion of the company s business is dependent on the overall market for computer peripherals 
this market  which itself is dependent on the market for computers  has historically been characterized by periods of rapid growth followed by periods of oversupply and contraction 
as a result  suppliers to the computer peripherals industry from time to time experience large and sudden fluctuations in demand for their products as their customers adjust to changing conditions in their markets 
if these fluctuations are not accurately anticipated  such suppliers  including the company  could produce excessive or insufficient inventories of various components which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
rapid technological change  dependence on new products  industry standards the markets in which the company and its competitors compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and continuing improvements in products and services 
the company s future success depends on its ability to enhance its current products and to develop and introduce in a timely manner new products that keep pace with technological developments and industry standards  compete effectively on the basis of price and performance  adequately address oem customer and end user customer requirements and achieve market acceptance 
the company believes that to remain competitive in the future it will need to continue to develop new products  which will require the investment of significant financial resources in new product development 
in anticipation of the implementation of fibre channel data transfer interface technologies  the company has invested and will continue to invest significant resources in developing its integrated circuit single chip pci to fibre channel controllers 
there can be no assurance that fibre channel will be adopted as a predominant industry standard 
the company is aware of products for alternative i o standards and enabling technologies being developed by its competitors 
the company believes that certain competitors  including symbios logic  inc  have extensive development efforts related to products based on the low voltage differential lvd technology 
there can be no assurance that such technology will not be adopted as an industry standard and if an alternative standard is adopted  there can be no assurance the company will timely develop products for such standard 
further  even if fibre channel is adopted  there can be no assurance that the company s integrated pci to fibre channel controller will be fully developed in time to be accepted for use in fibre channel technology or that  if developed  will achieve market acceptance  or be capable of being manufactured at competitive prices in sufficient volumes 
in the event that fibre channel is not adopted as an industry standard  or that the company s integrated circuit pci to fibre channel controllers are not timely developed or do not gain market acceptance  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely effected 
the computer industry is characterized by various standards and protocols that evolve with time 
the company s current products are designed to conform to certain industry standards and protocols such as ide  scsi  ultra scsi and pci 
in addition  the company s fibre channel products have been designed to conform with a standard that has yet to be uniformly adopted 
the company s products must be designed to operate effectively with a variety of hardware and software products supplied by other manufacturers  including microprocessors  operating system software and peripherals 
the company depends on significant cooperation with these manufacturers in order to achieve its design objectives and produce products that interoperate successfully 
while the company believes that it generally has good relationships with leading microprocessor  systems and peripheral suppliers  there can be no assurance that such suppliers will not from time to time make it more difficult for the company to design its products for successful interoperability 
if industry acceptance of these standards was to decline or if they were replaced with new standards  and if the company did not anticipate these changes and develop new products  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely effected 
the company could experience delays in product development that are common in the computer and semiconductor industry 
significant delays in product development and release would adversely effect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will respond effectively to technological changes or new product announcements by other companies or that the company s research and development efforts will be successful 
furthermore  introduction of new products and moving production of existing products to different suppliers involves substantial business risks because of the possibility of product bugs or performance problems  in which event the company could experience significant product returns  warranty expenses and expedite charges  in addition to lower sales and lower profits 
identification and integration of acquisitions the company anticipates that its future growth may depend in part on its ability to identify and acquire complementary businesses  technologies or product lines that are compatible with those of the company 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including identifying and pursuing acquisitions  difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies and products of the acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks associated with entering markets or conducting operations with which the company has no or limited direct prior experience  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of an acquisition will be realized 
there can be no assurance that the company will be effective in identifying and effecting attractive acquisitions  assimilating acquisitions or managing future growth 
future acquisitions by the company could result in potentially dilutive issuance s of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  all of which could materially adversely effect the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or stock price 
with respect to the possible amortization of goodwill  the financial accounting standards board fasb is considering making pooling of interests accounting treatment for merger transactions more difficult to attain  or may abolish such treatment altogether 
if the fasb does limit or eliminate pooling of interests accounting treatment  the company s ability to consummate merger transactions without incurring goodwill would be materially and adversely effected 
dependence on key personnel the company s future success is highly dependent on the continued services of its key engineering  sales  marketing and executive personnel  including highly skilled semiconductor design personnel and software developers  and its ability to identify and hire additional personnel 
the loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes that the market for key personnel in the industries in which it competes is highly competitive 
in particular  the company has experienced difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified engineers and other technical personnel and anticipates that competition for such personnel will increase in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain key personnel with the skills and expertise necessary to develop new products in the future  or to manage the company s business  both in the united states and abroad 
risks of doing business in international markets the company expects that export revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of the company s net revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  the company is subject to various risks  which include a greater difficulty of administering its business globally  compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting regulatory requirements such as export requirements  tariffs and other barriers  differences in intellectual property protections  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  potentially longer accounts receivable cycles  currency fluctuations  export control restrictions  overlapping or differing tax structures  political and economic instability  and general trade restrictions 
recently  the asian markets have suffered property price deflation 
this asset deflation has taken place especially in countries that have had a collapse in both their currency and stock markets  such as japan 
these deflationary pressures have reduced liquidity in the banking systems of the affected countries and  when coupled with spare industrial production capacity  could lead to widespread financial difficulty among the companies in this region 
the company s export sales are invoiced in us dollars and  accordingly  if the relative value of the us dollar in comparison to the currency of the company s foreign customers should increase  the resulting effective price increase of the company s products to such foreign customers could result in decreased sales 
there can be no assurance that any of the foregoing factors or the currency and economic disruptions in the asian markets will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
lack of significant patent protection  infringement risks although the company has patent protection on certain aspects of its technology in certain jurisdictions  it relies primarily on trade secrets  copyrights and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate to protect its proprietary rights  that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or that the company can maintain such technology as trade secrets 
there also can be no assurance that any patents the company possesses will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
in addition  the laws of certain countries in which the company s products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect the company s products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states or at all 
the failure of the company to protect its intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company has experienced intellectual property claims being made against it in the past 
there can be no assurance that patent or other intellectual property infringement claims will not be asserted against the company in the future 
although patent and intellectual property disputes may be settled through licensing or similar arrangements  costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and there can be no assurance that necessary licenses or similar arrangements would be available to the company on satisfactory terms or at all 
accordingly  an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent the company from manufacturing and selling certain of its products  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  should the company decide to  or be forced to  litigate such claims  such litigation could be expensive and time consuming  could divert management s attention from other matters or could otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations  regardless of the outcome of the litigation 
the company s supply of wafers and other components can also be interrupted by intellectual property infringement claims against its suppliers 
year many existing computer systems and applications  and other control devices  use only two digits to identify a year in the date field  without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century 
as a result  such systems and applications could fail or create erroneous results unless corrected so that they can process data related to the year the company relies on its systems  applications and devices in operating and monitoring all major aspects of its business  including financial systems such as general ledger  accounts payable and payroll modules  customer services  infrastructure  embedded computer chips  networks and telecommunications equipment and end products 
the company is in the process of upgrading its software to address the year issue 
because a large portion of the company s software is obtained from its vendors on a non custom basis  the company believes that upgrades for its commercial programs are currently available 
the company currently estimates that the costs associated with the year issue  and the consequences of incomplete or untimely resolution of the year issue  will not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial position of the company in any given year 
the company also relies  directly and indirectly  on external systems of business enterprises such as customers  suppliers  creditors  financial organizations  and of governmental entities  both domestic and international  for accurate exchange of data 
even if the internal systems of the company are not materially affected by the year issue  the company could be affected through disruptions in the operation of the enterprises with which the company interacts 
despite the company s efforts to address the year impact on its internal systems and business operations  there can be no assurance that such impact will not result in a material disruption of its business or have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations
