item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company generates revenue from products and services provided primarily to the in vitro diagnostic infectious disease industry 
there are two broad product classes diagnostic products and laboratory instruments 
diagnostic products consist of three groups quality control panels  accurun r run controls and diagnostic components 
services consist of specialty clinical laboratory testing  contract research  clinical trials  laboratory instrumentation services  and drug screening 
in the five full years since the company s acquisition of bbi biotech research laboratories bbi biotech and bbi clinical laboratories  inc bbicl  the company has experienced a shift in revenue mix towards increased product sales  as product revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased from in to in  with a corresponding decrease in the percentage of total revenue provided by services 
the company s gross profit margin increased from in to in principally as a result of the increased percentage of higher margin product revenues 
within products  the company s quality control products accurun r run controls and quality control panels have higher margins than the company s laboratory instruments and diagnostic components 
within services  contract research gross margins are lower than other services 
however  such contracts enable the company to maintain certain scientific staff and capability that it might otherwise not be able to afford 
the company intends to continue to concentrate on the growth in sales of its quality control products 
historically  the company s results of operations have been subject to quarterly fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including customer purchasing patterns  primarily driven by end of year expenditures  and seasonal demand during the summer months for certain laboratory testing services 
in particular  the company s sales of its quality control products and diagnostic components typically have been highest in the fourth quarter and lowest in the first quarter of each fiscal year  whereas specialty clinical laboratory testing has generally reached a seasonal peak during the third quarter  coinciding with the peak incidence of lyme disease 
research contracts are generally for large dollar amounts spread over a one or two year period  and upon completion  frequently do not have renewal phases 
as a result they can cause large fluctuations in revenue and net income 
in addition to staff dedicated to internal research and development  certain of the company s technical staff work on both contract research for customers and company sponsored research and development 
the allocation of certain technical staff to such projects depends on the volume of contract research 
as a result  research and development expenditures fluctuate due to increases or decreases in contract research 
to develop new quality control products and support increased sales  the company hired additional research and development staff in the second half of and sales and marketing staff in and the company intends to continue to add staff to these departments but at a reduced rate 
general and administrative expenses are not expected to increase at the same rate  as the company has already incurred significant infrastructure expenses 
the company does not have any foreign operations 
however  the company does have significant export sales in europe  the pacific rim countries and canada to agents under distribution agreements  as well as directly to test kit manufacturers 
all sales are denominated in us dollars 
export sales for the years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
the company expects that export sales will continue to be a significant source of revenue and operating income

service revenue included  from inclusion of bbi source  a increase in contract research revenue as a result of new contracts  and a increase in specialty clinical laboratory testing revenue as the company s hiv pcr test introduced in september  was offered for a full year in overall for both products and services  prices declined slightly in versus in summary  even after excluding bbi source  the company s total revenue increased in compared to with a increase in product revenue  and a increase in service revenue on strong volume performance by quality control products  contract research  and specialty clinical laboratory testing 
gross profit increased  or  to  for from  in product gross profit increased  or  to  in from  in and product gross profit margin increased to in from 
the products gross margin increase was a result of a favorable shift in product mix towards accurun sales and overall volume increase  thereby spreading fixed costs over a larger base  and despite a lower gross profit margin in bbi source s instrument sales 
services gross profit increased  or  to  in from  in as the testing volume increased at a faster rate than laboratory headcount  thereby causing the services gross profit margin to increase to in from in bbi source s service gross profit margin was slightly higher than the company average  which is expected to continue 
research and development expenditures increased  or  to  in from  in the increase resulted primarily from new laboratory instrument development activities at bbi source  as well as increased development expenditures for accurun r  molecular and immunological run controls  and specialized molecular assays 
selling and marketing expenses increased  or  to  in from  in the increase was attributable primarily to an eleven person expansion of the tqs sales  marketing  and technical support staff and related increased trade show and travel expenses 
in addition  the inclusion of bbi source added  of expense to this category 
general and administrative costs increased  or  to  in from  in this increase was attributable primarily to the addition of a director of human resources and wide area network systems analyst  higher expenditures for accounting and legal professionals and investor relations activities in our first full year as a public company  increased travel associated with the bbi source acquisition  and non recurring moving costs of  associated with moving bbi biotech research laboratories to a new facility in gaithersburg maryland 
these increases were partially offset by a lower provision for doubtful accounts as a result of improved accounts receivable collections from patients at the company s clinical reference testing laboratory 
in addition  the inclusion of bbi source added  of expense to this category 
operating income increased  or  to  in from  in this increase was primarily a result of continued strong performance in the company s quality control products business and clinic reference testing laboratory  partially offset by a loss at bbi source of  the company had net interest income of  in versus net interest expense of  in as substantially all of the company s debt was repaid in november with a portion of the proceeds from its ipo 
the company had positive cash balances to invest for all of net income increased  or  to  in from  in of this increase  was attributable to higher operating income  and the balance was due to the shift from net interest expense in to net interest income in diluted earnings per share increased to for versus in this increase was achieved even though weighted average diluted shares outstanding increased

the increase in service revenue was primarily the result of increased volume of specialty clinical laboratory testing and a favorable mix shift towards higher priced molecular testing  and the impact of two new research contracts 
this was partially offset by lower volume of clinical trial services 
gross profit increased  or  to  for from  in products gross profit increased  or  to  in from  in and products gross profit margin increased to in from 
the products gross margin increase was a result of a favorable mix shift towards accurun sales 
services gross profit increased  or  to  in from  in as the testing volume increased at a faster rate than laboratory headcount increased  and thereby caused the services gross profit margin to increase to in from in research and development expenditures increased  or  to  in from  in the increase resulted from increased costs of personnel hired in the second half of to step up the rate of new product introductions  and increased research project expenditures 
development projects included accurun r  molecular and immunological run controls  specialized molecular assays  and expenditures related to the company s drug discovery program 
selling and marketing expenses increased  or  to  in from  in the increase was attributable primarily to additional sales and marketing staff and overhead  increased advertising  promotion  trade show and travel expenses due to the commencement of the company s total quality system tqs marketing campaign  and costs associated with participation by the company s specialty clinical laboratory in the roche diagnostics amplicor access program in connection with roche s launch of their new fda approved hiv pcr test kit 
the amplicor kit is primarily used to monitor the hiv viral load level in patients prior to and during drug therapy 
general and administrative costs increased  or  to  in from  in this increase was attributable primarily to additional staffing in support of company growth and higher reserve provisions for doubtful accounts associated with the increased volume of revenue related to testing in situations in which payment to the company depends on collecting from the patient rather than a healthcare institution 
operating income increased  or  to  in from  in this increase was primarily a result of a very strong performance in the company s quality control products business and clinic reference testing laboratory 
net interest expense decreased  or  to  in from  in  as the proceeds from the company s initial public offering were used to pay down almost all debt in early november  and the remaining amount invested in short term  investment grade securities

the company expects its cash flow and cash position to meet existing operational needs  although its revolving line of credit will be available as needed for working capital 
net cash provided by operations for was  as compared to  in as discussed above  this decrease in cash flow was primarily attributable to carrying additional accounts receivable and inventory as of year end 
this was partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue from a payment of  under a research contract for future clinical trial services  and a net increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  also benefiting net cash from operations for was a  reduction in current federal tax liability as a result of non qualified stock option exercises 
cash flow used in operations in was  as working capital needs due to sales growth exceeded cash generated from net income adjusted by non cash expenses 
cash used in investing activities for  and amounted to   and  respectively 
in addition to normal capital expenditures  four items accounted for most of the investing activities 
first  the company exercised its option to purchase an additional  shares of bioseq  inc stock at an aggregate cost of  thereby increasing its ownership of bioseq to 
second  in may  the company s bbi biotech subsidiary signed a ten year lease for new laboratory space in gaithersburg  maryland and spent  on leasehold improvements for new laboratory space for its contract research and product development activities 
third  the expansion and renovation of its diagnostic products manufacturing facility in west bridgewater  massachusetts commenced construction and approximately  was expended as the project is now over two thirds complete 
finally  effective on july   the company completed the acquisition of the business and net assets of source scientific  inc at a purchase price of  including acquisition costs 
the company has accounted for the acquisition as an asset purchase  and is amortizing goodwill of approximately million over years

in  net cash generated from common stock issued  including the ipo  approximated  this was used to pay down net debt of  net cash provided by borrowings for amounted to  and net proceeds from the sale of common stock for the same period was approximately  the proceeds of such debt were used for working capital  to acquire the west bridgewater property and to purchase capital equipment 
in  and capital expenditures amounted to   and  respectively 
the expenditures included both the massachusetts and maryland facility improvement  and the expenditures related to the purchase of the west bridgewater facility  all as discussed above 
on april  the company entered into a new five year distribution agreement with kyowa medex  co  ltd  a foreign distributor  extending a six year old relationship 
simultaneously  kyowa purchased  shares of the company s common stock at a price of per share 
under the distribution agreement  kyowa has been granted an exclusive right to sell and distribute the company s products in japan and to continue to purchase product from the company at a discount 
in return  kyowa is obligated to achieve certain minimum sales levels  provide market  sales and regulatory information  and has agreed not to compete with the company 
on march   the company announced plans to modify a previously announced year contract with abx hematology  inc abx and its parent company  abx hematologie  sa france 
under the contract  the company provided technical  customer and field services for instruments sold by abx in the united states 
under the modified agreement  individual customer service contracts will be assigned to abx and abx will assume responsibility for its united states instruments 
the company will provide certain consulting services through march to assist abx in establishing a sales  customer service  technical support  and field service operation in the united states for its hematology instrument and reagent business 
in addition  the company has agreed to allow abx to occupy space at its california facility during the period of the agreement 
the company s personnel associated with this contract  included the nationwide field service organization and hotline technical support  will be offered employment by abx 
the company is accounting for its investment in bioseq on the cost basis in accordance with the provisions of apb since its cumulative investment is less than of the equity of bioseq and the company does not exert significant influence or control 
bioseq needs to obtain additional financing in to continue operations and there can be no assurances that any such financing will be available upon acceptable terms 
due to the uncertainty of technology based development stage enterprises  the company performs a periodic analysis of the investment to determine whether the carrying value of its investment in bioseq has been other than temporarily impaired 
in performing the analysis of its investment in bioseq for the current year  management considered bioseq s positive factors including its technology  patent positions  business prospects  and the possibility of raising capital and achieving financial success  as well as its negative cash flow and net worth  and limited cash and other resources  and failure to date to raise significant capital independent of the company 
management has concluded that its investment has not been other than temporarily impaired  if at all 
if it is subsequently determined to be impaired  the company will adjust the carrying value of its investment by taking a charge to earnings which could amount to the full value of its  investment as of december  see also note relating to the company s  purchase of certain technology rights from bioseq 
the company anticipates capital expenditures to begin slowing down in as most of the maryland and approximately two thirds of the massachusetts projects have been completed 
the company believes that existing cash balances  the borrowing capacity available under the revolving line of credit  and cash generated from operations are sufficient to fund operations and anticipated capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
except for purchase orders in connection with the manufacturing expansion  there were no material financial commitments for capital expenditures as of december  year computer systems compliance concerns have been widely expressed regarding the inability of certain computer programs to process date information beyond year these concerns focus on the impact of the year problem on business operations and the potential costs associated with identifying and addressing the problem 
the company is in the process of evaluating and taking steps to deal with the potential impact of this problem in areas under its control  including its products and sources of supply  as well as its operations management  administration and financial systems 
based on its review to date  the company believes that its products are year compliant 
the company plans to correct or replace its administrative and business systems in time to avoid material problems 
the company has confirmed with existing software vendors that year compliant versions either exist or will be available to upgrade or replace its operations management  administrative and financial systems 
where it believes that a particular supplier s situation poses unacceptable risks  the company plans to identify an alternative source 
based upon its review  the company does not believe that the year problem will have a material adverse affect on the company 
however  there can be no assurances that failure to comply with year by parties outside its control will not have a material adverse affect on the company
