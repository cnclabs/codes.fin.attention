item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company s decision to dispose of its nutritional supplements product line and contract manufacturing operations requires a restatement of its historical financial information under applicable accounting principles and regulations to reflect such operations as discontinued operations see introductory note and item elsewhere in this report 
as a result of the company s restatement of its historical financial information  the comparative dollar values and percentage amounts used throughout item of this report reflect this restatement and relate solely to the company s continuing pharmaceutical operations  unless otherwise indicated 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results in future periods may differ significantly from the results discussed in or anticipated by such forward looking statements 
certain factors which may impact results for future periods are discussed below under the captions overview and risks and uncertainties 
overview founded in  the company manufactures  markets and distributes specialty pharmaceutical products 
the company has achieved significant increases in sales and net income through acquisitions of pharmaceutical products and businesses to complement or expand the company s business and to add selected manufacturing capacity to support certain product lines 
at december   the company had completed such acquisitions of which five were completed in the preceding months  including the acquisition of cytomel and triostat from smithkline on june  in addition to the significant revenue growth derived from acquisition activity  the company pursues internal growth initiatives to develop marketing opportunities with respect to the acquired product lines and businesses 
sales from continuing operations and income from continuing operations have increased from million and million in  respectively  to million and million in  respectively  representing four year compounded annual growth rates of approximately in sales from continuing operations and in income from continuing operations 
sales from continuing operations are reported net of returns  rebates and discounts during the period in which product is shipped 
product rebates and discounts are incurred due to volume or other contractual allowances on certain sales under contracts with hospitals  buying groups and managed care organizations 
as of december  and  the company maintained reserves of million and million  respectively  for unclaimed but anticipated rebates and discounts 
product returns  pursuant to operating policies with respect to unused pharmaceuticals  are less than of gross annual sales 
return policies applicable to products acquired as a result of the daniels acquisition were revised effective december   to conform to other pharmaceuticals having lower rates of product return 
sales from continuing operations are reflected prior to royalties due on sales of certain pharmaceuticals arising from product line acquisitions 
such royalties are recorded as a selling expense 
royalty arrangements typically extend for a fixed period from the date of acquisition and do not require minimum payments to maintain ownership or any rights to products 
during the year ending december   sales from continuing operations were million comprised of million of endocrine pharmaceuticals  million of critical care pharmaceuticals  million of veterinary pharmaceuticals and million of other products 
the increase in such sales has been influenced by acquisition activity as well as by enhanced marketing activity  customer demand and product availability 
in august the company acquired domestic rights to the brevital pharmaceutical line from lilly for million and a year royalty of on net sales of brevital 
sales of brevital represented approximately of the company s sales from continuing operations in and approximately in in march the company acquired domestic rights to the tapazole pharmaceutical line from lilly for million and a year royalty of on net sales of tapazole 
sales from continuing operations of tapazole for periods after the acquisition represented approximately of the company s sales from continuing operations in and approximately in sales from levoxyl  a key product acquired in connection with the daniels acquisition in  represented approximately of the company s sales from continuing operations in and has increased to approximately in in june  the company acquired domestic  puerto rican and canadian rights to the cytomel and triostat pharmaceutical lines from smithkline for million 
although the company is not obligated to pay smithkline royalties on future sales of cytomel and triostat  the acquisition agreement does provide that in the event triostat is approved by the fda for any additional indications  the company will be obligated to pay smithkline a year royalty of on net incremental sales of triostat resulting from such indications 
since their acquisition on june   combined sales from continuing operations of cytomel and triostat represented approximately of such company sales in the company s strategy for continued growth is materially dependent upon its continued ability to acquire  by purchase or exclusive license arrangements  niche market pharmaceuticals which can be promoted through existing marketing and distribution channels 
the company also intends to market aggressively the principal products in its current portfolio together with new formats or formulations of existing products and  when appropriate  to enhance its marketing and distribution channels 
in pursuing its acquisition strategy  the company relies to a significant degree upon the availability of product lines subject to divestiture or sale by other manufacturers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to acquire rights to additional products on acceptable terms  if at all  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect upon the company s rate of growth and on its business and financial conditions and results of operations 
the success of the company s efforts in managing its existing business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
factors which may affect the company include its dependence upon a limited number of key pharmaceuticals  the company s ability to integrate new product acquisitions and to adapt and expand its marketing capabilities to the needs of such products  and its reliance upon third party manufacturers to produce certain key products 
the company s operations and growth will also be influenced by regulatory and governmental policies and by competitive forces within the pharmaceutical industry 
in particular  the fda announced in an august   federal register notice that orally administered drug products containing levothyroxine sodium are now classified as new drugs 
manufacturers who wish to continue to market these products must submit nda s 
after august   any levothyroxine sodium product marketed without an approved nda will be subject to regulatory action 
levoxyl  since it was marketed prior to the date of this notice will continue to be eligible for marketing until august  the fda is allowing the company and other current manufacturers three years to obtain approved nda s 
the company plans to dedicate significant resources to this nda process during and and expects to incur costs in excess of million to secure an approved nda for levoxyl 
results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report 
the following table sets forth certain data as a percentage of net sales from continuing operations for the periods indicated

in the absence of such charges  operating income from continuing operations would have been of net sales and income from continuing operations before income tax would have increased to 
sales from continuing operations sales from continuing operations for the year ended december   increased to million from million for the year ended december   following an increase in of to million from sales from continuing operations of million for the year ended december  in both and the company s increases in sales from continuing operations were the result of the acquisition of brevital august  the acquisition of tapazole march  the acquisition of triostat and cytomel june and internal sales growth in both unit and dollar growth in the company s primary products 
specifically  sales from continuing operations grew due to both unit and dollar sales growth of thrombin jmi  levoxyl and brevital  as well as a full twelve months of tapazole sales versus nine months in and six months of sales of cytomel and triostat 
sales from continuing operations in grew due to both unit and dollar sales growth of thrombin jmi and levoxyl  as well as the inclusion of four additional months of brevital sales in  and the acquisition of tapazole in march gross profit gross profit during increased or million to million from million in as a percentage of sales from continuing operations  margins increased to in from in due to the continued sales growth of the company s higher margin products

as a result of the addition of the sales and marketing staff and the planned increase in sampling of products to physician prescribers in  it was expected that selling expenses would increase significantly in  however  as a percentage of sales from continuing operations  the company was able to hold selling expenses relatively flat at of sales from continuing operations in versus of sales from continuing operations in selling expenses increased or million to million in from million in due to increased royalties  administrative fees and the increase in the endocrine sales staff from persons in to persons in as a percentage of sales from continuing operations  these expenses decreased to in from in general and administrative expenses remained relatively flat in at million compared to million in and as a percentage of sales from continuing operations  declined from in to in general and administrative expenses in increased or  to million from million in primarily as a result of higher salaries and overhead  but declined as a percentage of sales from continuing operations to in from in there were no research and development expenses in as compared to  in due to the reduction of new product development at the company s wholly owned subsidiary  jmi daniels 
research and development expenses declined in to  from  in primarily due to the reduction of ongoing expenses by gentrac related to development efforts for pre mixed liquid thrombin formulations 
amortization expenses associated with intangible assets and included in selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in due to a full year of amortization expense associated with the tapazole product line acquired in march  the abana acquisition on december  and a half year of amortization expense associated with the acquisition of cytomel and triostat in june as a percentage of sales from continuing operations  amortization expense increased from in to in amortization expenses increased to million in from million in due to the acquisition of the tapazole product line in march and a full year of amortization expense associated with the brevital product line acquired in august as a percentage of sales from continuing operations  these expenses increased from in to in a one time acquisition charge of million was taken in in conjunction with certain costs and expenses associated with the daniels acquisition which was treated as a pooling of interests transaction 
approximately million of such charges related to compensation items directly or indirectly related to the change of control of daniels  including certain costs paid by shareholders  and million to financial advisory services incurred by daniels 
the remaining charges related primarily to transaction expenses including the fees and expenses of counsel and accountants for both daniels and its parent  galen and the company 
operating income from continuing operations operating income from continuing operations during increased or million to million from million in  and increased as a percentage of sales from continuing operations to in from in  as the result of higher overall gross profits and marginal increases in operating expenses 
operating income from continuing operations during increased or million to million from million in and increased as a percentage of sales from continuing operations to in from in as a result of a greater increase in gross profits offset partially by an increase in operating expenses 
other income expense interest income from investing activities increased to million in from million in as a result of higher cash balances

at december   the company had no outstanding debt 
interest income from investing activities increased sharply to million in from  in as the result of the million cash infusion from the april sale of additional common stock

net income net income increased or million to million in from million in  and increased as a percentage of sales from continuing operations to in from in net income increased or million to million in from million in  and decreased as a percentage of sales from continuing operations to in from in fourth quarter to sales from continuing operations during the fourth quarter of increased million  or  to million from million during the fourth quarter of income from continuing operations during the fourth quarter of increased million  or  to million from million in the fourth quarter of net income during the fourth quarter of increased million  or  to million from million during the fourth quarter of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were 
in the fourth quarter of compared to 
per share in the fourth quarter of total diluted earnings per share during the fourth quarter of were  with million average shares outstanding  compared to 
per share  with million average shares outstanding  during the fourth quarter of the increases resulted from improved operations throughout  increased sales of higher margin products  the addition of an endocrine sales force in december  and the acquisition of cytomel and triostat on june  financial condition balance sheet information the company s current ratio increased to as of december  from as of december   working capital increased to million as of december  from million as of december   and financing debt as a percentage of equity was eliminated as of december  versus as of december  due to the final payment in the third quarter of under the borrowings related to the acquisition of the brevital product line 
liquidity and capital resources since inception the company has financed its operations primarily through cash flow from operations  public and private sales of equity securities and borrowings under revolving credit facilities 
at december  and  the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
the net cash generated from operating activities of million in was used to fund the acquisition of cytomel and triostat for million  capital improvements of million  repayment of the remaining outstanding long term debt of million and payment of dividends to common stockholders of million 
the company believes that available resources and anticipated cash flows from operations are adequate to meet currently anticipated operating needs and  together with the net proceeds to be derived from discontinued operations  to fund future acquisitions 
while the company does not maintain current lines of credit  it believes it has sufficient borrowing capacity in the event that acquisition opportunities cannot be funded from existing resources 
total assets increased million to million at december  from million at december   and total liabilities decreased million to million at december  from million at december  intangible assets  principally licenses  trademarks and goodwill associated with acquired products  increased million  net of amortization charges during the year  to million at december   due to the acquisition of cytomel and triostat in june intangible assets as a percent of shareholders equity increased slightly from at december  to at december  inventories increased million to million at december   from million at december  this inventory increase in compares favorably with the sales growth in prior to the restatement for discontinued operations 
accounts receivable increased to million at december  from million at december   primarily due to a increase in fourth quarter sales from continuing operations in in days outstanding  accounts receivable increased to days at december  from days at december  net property plant and equipment increased by million to million at december   from million at december   primarily due to the continued expansion of the company s gentrac and jmi daniels manufacturing facilities during the company has experienced only moderate raw material and labor price increases in recent years 
while the company has passed some price increases along to customers  the company has primarily benefited from rapid sales growth  negating most inflationary pressures 
the company s manufacturing operations are not capital intensive and  as such  the impact of inflation on the property  plant and equipment and associated depreciation expense of the company has been minimal 
recent accounting pronouncements during the company adopted fasb statement no 
 earnings per share 
the adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements or results of operations 
all earnings per share amounts for all periods have been presented  and where appropriate  restated to conform to the statement s requirements 
risks and uncertainties the future results of operations  both annually and from quarter to quarter  are subject to a variety of factors applicable to the company and to the industries and markets in which it operates 
in addition to factors discussed above and elsewhere in this report  the following should be considered 
dependence upon key products 
the company s continued growth in revenues and earnings is primarily attributable to its acquisitions of a limited number of key products with higher gross margins 
during  sales of tapazole  levoxyl  brevital and thrombin jmi represented  in the aggregate  approximately of total sales 
any factor adversely affecting either the availability of  or the market for  any of such products would have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
product pricing constraints and adjustments 
in addition to other competitive factors  the ability of the company to maintain or increase profit margins for products depends in part on the availability of adequate reimbursement to the company s customers and patients from third party health care payors  such as governments  private insurers and managed care organizations 
policies adopted by third party payors influence the pricing of medical services and products 
there can be no assurance that reimbursement will be available for the company s products or that such third party reimbursement will be adequate 
moreover  under contracts with hospitals and buying groups applicable to the sale of many of the company s products  final sales prices to distributors may be subject to retroactive adjustment based upon volume or other contractual discounts provided by the company 
while the company believes that it has adequate reserves to cover such adjustments  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience price adjustments in the future that significantly exceed such reserves 
regulation and product risks 
the manufacturing  processing  formulation  packaging  labeling  advertising and sampling of the company s products are subject to extensive regulations by various federal and state agencies  including the fda  the ftc  the dea  the cpsc  the department of agriculture  and the epa 
in addition to other costs of compliance with such regulations  the company is subject to possible risks arising from changes in such regulations or based upon alleged violations of regulations 
such risks could render products unavailable or unmarketable or result in product recalls 
any such development could materially and adversely affect the company s reputation  business  financial condition and results of operations 
in particular  the fda announced in an august   federal register notice that orally administered drug products containing levothyroxine sodium are now classified as new drugs 
manufacturers who wish to continue to market these products must submit nda s 
after august   any levothyroxine sodium product marketed without an approved nda will be subject to regulatory action 
levoxyl  since it was marketed prior to the date of this notice will continue to be eligible for marketing until august  the fda is allowing the company and other current manufacturers three years to obtain approved nda s 
the company plans to dedicate significant resources to this nda process during and and expects to incur costs in excess of million to secure an approved nda for levoxyl 
in addition to government regulation  the company faces an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event use of a product is alleged to have resulted in adverse effects for a patient or consumer 
such risk exists even with respect to those products which are manufactured in regulated facilities or otherwise possess regulatory approval for commercial sale 
while the company has taken  and continues to take  what it believes are appropriate precautions  there can be no assurance that it will avoid significant product liability exposure 
the company currently has product liability insurance in the amount of million per claim and million in the aggregate and excess coverage of million through an umbrella policy  however  there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover potential claims or that such insurance coverage will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
specifically  in the event that the company s insurance coverage is inadequate to satisfy any resulting liability arising from current litigation involving claims related to dexfenfluramine  fenfluramine and phentermine in which the company has been named as a defendant  then the company will have to resume defense of such lawsuits and be responsible for the damages see legal proceedings 
accordingly  a product liability claim could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
reliance on third party manufacturers 
the company has historically relied on third party manufacturers to produce many of its products and currently relies upon third party manufacturers for production of brevital  tapazole  triostat and cytomel  each of which is a key pharmaceutical 
although such products are subject to manufacturing arrangements with reliable and substantial entities  alternative sources are not readily available and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain adequate supplies of such products in a timely fashion  or at all 
disruption in the available supply of brevital  tapazole  triostat or cytomel or the inability of the company to obtain sources of supply upon the expiration of current manufacturing arrangements would be materially adverse to the business  financial condition and results of operations of the company 
competition 
many of the company s competitors have considerably greater financial  sales  marketing and technical resources than those of the company 
in addition  many of the company s present competitors have extensive research and development capabilities that may allow such competitors to develop new or improved products that may compete with the company s products 
technological advances affecting the cost of production as well as marketing or pricing action by one or more of the competitors could also materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
compliance with year historically  certain computer programs have been written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  which could result in such programs and or a computer running such programs recognizing a date using as the year rather than the year this  in turn  could result in major system failures or miscalculations  and is generally referred to as the year problem 
the company is currently in the process of upgrading and replacing its information technology systems in the normal course of its business 
in connection with the upgrades and replacement systems  the new functionality will be compliant  in all material respects  with year requirements 
accordingly  the company does not expect the year requirements to result in significant additional costs or to have a materially adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations  however  there can be no assurances that this will be the case 
in addition  the ability of third parties with whom the company transacts business adequately to address their year issues is outside the company s control 
there can be no assurance that the failure of any third parties adequately to address their respective year issues will not have a material adverse effect of the company s business  financial condition and results of operations
