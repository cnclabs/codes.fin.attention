gross profit systems services the company has experienced significant variations in revenues  expenses and operating results from quarter to quarter and such variations are likely to continue 
a significant portion of the company s revenues have been generated from a limited number of customers and it is difficult to predict the timing of future orders and shipments to these and other customers 
customers can cancel or reschedule shipments  and development or production difficulties could delay shipments 
the company has also experienced significant variations in its quarterly gross margins 
in the third quarter of  the company decreased the selling price of its first generation seachange spot digital video insertion system in anticipation of the introduction of the second generation system in the first quarter of this price reduction had a negative impact on the company s systems gross margins in the first and second quarters of in the third and fourth quarters of  the decrease in the number of systems sold affected the company s ability to achieve manufacturing efficiencies and  accordingly  the gross profit was negatively impacted 
quarterly services gross margins have historically fluctuated significantly because installation and training service revenue varies by quarter  while the related costs are relatively consistent by quarter 
operating expenses also vary with the number  timing and significance of new product and product enhancement introductions by the company and its competitors  increased competition  changes in pricing policies by the company or its competitors  the gain or loss of significant customers  the hiring of new personnel and general economic conditions 
all of the above factors are difficult for the company to forecast  and these or other factors may materially adversely effect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations for one quarter or a series of quarters 
only a small portion of the company s expenses vary with revenues in the short term and there would likely be a material adverse effect on the operating results of the company if future revenues are lower than expectations 
based upon all of the foregoing  the company believes that quarterly revenues and operating results are likely to vary significantly in the future and that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance
