item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the results of operations of the company depend in large part upon demand and prices for scrap metals in world markets and steel products on the us west coast 
increasing steel demand and prices have led to improved profitability during the period of fiscal through fiscal primarily due to the asian financial crisis  fiscal results for scrap operations were negatively impacted 
the company s income from joint ventures for the year ended august  was significantly higher than in prior years due to the acquisition of proler  effective november  in march  the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of mmi 
mmi s results of operations have been included in the company s financial statements since march  and have had a significant impact on the company s scrap related revenue and income since then 
the following tables set forth information regarding the breakdown of revenues between the company s scrap operations and steel operations  and the breakdown of income from operations between scrap operations  steel operations and joint ventures 
additional financial information relating to business segments is contained in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

form k part ii continued income from operations year ended august  in millions scrap operations steel operations joint ventures corporate expense and eliminations income from operations includes the results of operations of proler from november   the date of acquisition  through august  includes the results of operations of mmi from march   the date of acquisition  through august  in july  the company sold certain of its portland nonferrous operations including a nonferrous business acquired in the mmi transaction  which resulted in a decline in nonferrous revenues for fiscal ferrous scrap sales from scrap operations to steel operations are made at a negotiated market rate per ton 
corporate expense and eliminations consist primarily of unallocated corporate expense for services that benefit both scrap operations and steel operations 
because of this unallocated expense  the income from operations of each segment does not reflect the income from operations the segment would have as a stand alone business 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues for scrap operations decreased  while revenues for steel operations increased  resulting in a net decrease in the company s revenues of million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the company achieved record shipments of finished steel products and produced record tons of billets in fiscal scrap operations generated revenues of million  before intercompany eliminations  compared with million in fiscal  representing a decrease of million 
ferrous revenues decreased million as the result of a decrease in ferrous tons shipped at lower average selling prices 
sales to the company s steel operations were down slightly 
scrap operations made ferrous scrap export shipments totaling  tons in fiscal  compared with shipments totaling  tons in fiscal  while domestic third party tonnage increased to  tons 
the average selling price for ferrous scrap declined per ton to with the largest decline occurring in export prices during the second half of steel operations revenues increased million to million 
higher volumes sold  coupled with an increase in selling prices  contributed to the increase 
average steel selling prices increased per ton to  while finished steel tons shipped increased  tons to  tons

cost of sales per ferrous ton shipped remained unchanged from to the average selling price of ferrous scrap also declined  resulting in a decrease in scrap operations gross profit of million 
cost of goods sold for steel operations increased million to million as the result of increased tonnage shipped 
cost of sales per ton decreased as the result of lower scrap prices and increased plant efficiencies 
this decrease  coupled with a per ton increase in the average selling price for finished steel and a increase in tonnage shipped  resulted in a million increase in overall gross profit and a increase in gross profit per ton for finished steel 
selling and administrative expenses

ferrous revenues declined  however  despite a  ton increase in shipments  due to softer selling prices for scrap 
sales to the company s steel operations increased by  tons to  tons 
although the total number of scrap export shipments were the same as the prior year  foreign scrap tonnage declined slightly  while domestic third party sales tonnage remained relatively the same as the prior year 
average ferrous scrap revenues per ton for the first three quarters of fiscal were lower than for the same period in the prior year  resulting in a lower average selling price for the year of per ton compared with for fiscal the company believes that  due to a temporary build up in scrap inventories by scrap processors and steel mills caused by a slackening in demand  the average prices for ferrous scrap on the world market declined during this period 
the average selling price during the fourth quarter of fiscal was higher than for the same period in the prior year 
the increase in other sales reflects the acquisition of proler in november steel operations revenues increased million to million

year the following discussion is provided in response to the securities and exchange commission s interpretation of disclosure of year issues and consequences by public companies  investment advisors  investment companies  and municipal securities issuers 
in response to year compliance issues  the company has developed a systematic approach that consists of the following three phases identification and assessment to identify potential year issues  modification or replacement of equipment and software  final testing to ensure that all systems are year compliant after modifications are installed 
the company has divided its year issues into the following categories a physical hardware and related operating systems at the corporate data processing facility  b business and financial reporting systems at all locations  c personal computers and peripheral equipment at all locations  d facility and support systems including communication devices and safety systems at all locations  e manufacturing systems at cascade steel rolling mills 
the company has completed the identification and assessment phase for the corporate data processing facility  the business and financial reporting systems at all locations  the personal computers and peripheral equipment at all locations  and the facility and support systems at a majority of its locations 
the company currently expects that all phase activities will be complete by march  the company has completed the modification of equipment at the corporate data processing facility  the business and financial reporting systems at all locations  personal computers at all locations  and expects the remainder of phase activities to be complete no later than may   except for steel operations which is expected to be complete no later than november  the company expects to complete phase activities by no later than may   except for steel operations which is expected to be complete no later than november  management estimates that the costs for correction of the year issues  including any software and hardware upgrades but excluding replacements that would have occurred even without the year issue  and the cost of personnel allocated to this project should not exceed  of which  is expected to be capital expenditures 
approximately  has been spent to date 
the year upgrades are being funded through normal operating funds and are expected to account for less than of the company s information technology  maintenance and manufacturing capital budgets 
there can be no assurance that the costs and timeframes above will not change as the company continues its assessments 
the year project is a priority project for the company s it and engineering departments 
no significant it or engineering projects are being deferred as a result of the company s year efforts

form k part ii continued the company is also in the process of assessing the year readiness of its key vendors using questionnaires and letters 
in the event a critical vendor is found to be non compliant  the company will develop contingency plans to address the issue 
as the company is not dependent on any significant customer  and given the nature of the scrap business  no year assessment of customers is anticipated 
at the present time  the company has not expended the resources to develop a contingency plan with respect to year compliance as the company believes it will be year ready 
liquidity and capital resources for the year ended august   cash generated by operations was million compared to million for the same period last year 
the decrease in cash generated this year is predominantly due to a decrease in net income and an increase in inventories  off set by a decrease in accounts receivable

other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following supply and demand conditions  the company s ability to mitigate the effects of the asian situation and foreign fiscal policies on its profitability  railroad service difficulties  competitive factors and pricing pressures from national steel companies  imports of foreign steel  availability of scrap supply  fluctuations in scrap prices and seasonality of results 
one should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all factors that could cause actual results to differ from the company s forward looking statements 
consequently  the reader should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties
