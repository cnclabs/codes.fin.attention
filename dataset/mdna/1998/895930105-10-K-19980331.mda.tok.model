item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company s mission is to provide heating  cooling and electricity with half the fossil fuel and half the pollution of conventional generation 
the company considers itself a thermal sciences company which uses its expertise in thermodynamic engineering and proprietary cogeneration processes to convert fuel to various forms of thermal energy and electricity at more efficient conversion rates than conventional processes 
a district energy system consists of a central production plant that distributes steam and or hot water or chilled water to customer facilities through underground distribution pipes 
cogeneration is the conversion of a single fuel source into two useful energy products  such as steam and electricity  with a greater efficiency than is possible by producing the two products separately 
at six of its cogeneration facilities  the company has expanded cogeneration to trigeneration  which is the generation of steam or hot water  electricity and chilled water 
in addition  the company incorporates in its systems innovative applications for standardized  modular equipment to improve productivity 
growth the company s revenues have increased from approximately million in its first full year of operation to million in through acquisition and internal growth 
this annual report includes consolidated statements of operations which report the company s revenues and operating income for the last three fiscal years 
the company had total assets at the end of of  at the end of of  and at the end of of  the amount and percentage of total revenue contributed by thermal energy sales and electric energy sales for the last three years is reported in item of this annual report management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the amount of revenue  operating profit or loss attributable to export sales outside the united states for the last three years was not material to the company 
in december  the company acquired united thermal corporation utc  which operated steam only district energy systems in four communities 
this acquisition more than doubled the company s revenues on a pro forma basis 
during  the company acquired a waste to energy district energy system serving the province of prince edward island in canada 
in  the company and a subsidiary of tucson electric power company formed a limited partnership which purchased the energy systems of coors brewing company and coors energy company in golden  colorado 
the company has a interest in that partnership 
in january  the company acquired the privately held ewing power  a systems integrator of steam turbine cogenerator systems 
in march  the company s subsidiary  trigen schuylkill energy corporation  acquired a one third interest in grays ferry cogeneration partnership  a pennsylvania single purpose partnership that operates a megawatt mw gas or oil fired combined cycle cogeneration facility located in downtown philadelphia the grays ferry cogeneration facility 
the grays ferry cogeneration facility commenced operation on january  upon the achievement of full commercial operation and conversion of the related construction loan to a term loan  trigen schuylkill will operate the grays ferry cogeneration facility as managing partner 
in january  the company acquired power sources  inc  which has been renamed trigen biopower  inc trigen biopower operates seven biomass to energy plants  producing steam for industrial customers from renewable biomass fuels including wood residues  rice hulls  cotton waste and paper mill sludge 
joint ventures in march  the company entered into a joint venture with the privately held gentor industries  sa de sa of monterrey  mexico to complete the installation and utilization of mw of new cogeneration capacity and develop additional cogeneration opportunities in mexico 
in november   the company entered into a joint venture with hydro quebec to provide a range of energy services throughout new england and upstate new york 
the company and hydro quebec are currently discussing changes to their relationship in order to further expand their common business in the us and canada 
in december  the company entered into a joint venture with cinergy corp 
to build  own and operate cogeneration and trigeneration facilities throughout the united states  canada  the united kingdom and ireland  subject to certain exclusions resulting from pre existing agreements 
in june  the company entered into a joint venture with nova scotia power incorporated to develop district energy and co generation opportunities in nova scotia  new brunswick and newfoundland  canada 
in november  the company entered into a joint venture with stockholm energi ab to extend the company s urban steam systems with hot water distribution to less dense areas outside of urban centers 
the company has entered these joint ventures to enable it to offer a complete package of energy commodity and energy production services  to reach more customers  and to be in a position to participate in the anticipated deregulated electricity market 
business strategy significant opportunities for the company s continued growth include expanding existing systems to serve additional customers or the expanded needs of existing customers  acquiring systems or assuming management of additional systems  adding new services to its systems and developing new systems to provide district energy or independent power wherever the company s expertise provides a competitive advantage 
key elements of the company s growth and profitability have included the following economies of scale 
the company s growth is attributable in large part to the inherent economies of scale of district energy systems when compared to individual customer production of heating and cooling 
these advantages include the utilization of large efficient machinery  labor savings  the ability to serve diverse peak requirements of various customers  and specialization in energy production and distribution 
in many locations  these advantages outweigh the limitations of district energy systems  which often involve significant capital expenditures in the initial stages of construction or expansion and generally require a high density of customer buildings 
stable customer base 
the company s long term contracts ie  contracts with terms of five years or more would provide pro forma consolidated revenues of over million per year for the five year period through and approximately billion cumulatively for the period through assuming  among other things  no inflation and no changes in consumption or prices from levels 
since customers with short term contracts do not operate boiler rooms and chillers  and in most cases do not even have such equipment  customer attrition has been low 
technical innovation and plant optimization 
the company has developed computerized  automated control systems  typically installed in large scale generating facilities  which place real time production cost information in the hands of its plant operators 
in addition  patents have been granted for certain of its trigeneration and chilling technologies 
natural barriers to entry 
once a system is in place  the company benefits from natural barriers to entry by anyone trying to create a competing system and is able to add customers within reach of its installed systems at a relatively low additional cost although not all potential customers can be added on a cost effective basis 
expansion to industrial plants 
while the company continues to grow its business of district heating and cooling  there appear to be growing opportunities to provide combined heat and power at industrial sites 
the company s newly acquired subsidiary trigen biopower produces steam for industrial customers from renewable biomass fuels  including wood residues  rice hulls  cotton waste  and paper mill sludge 
rate structures 
because the company s rate structures typically enable it to pass through to its customers fuel and most other commodity prices  changes in such prices which constitute approximately of the company s costs have little impact on operating income 
however  the company is not a monopoly provider and its rates must remain cost competitive 
reduced environmental impact 
the company produces substantially less pollutants than would result from conventional generation of the same heat  electricity  and cooling 
this is due to the fuel efficiency of cogeneration and trigeneration  the use of biomass fuels which minimizes the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere  employment of refrigerants other than cfcs wherever possible  thermal  chemical  and catalytic destruction of exhaust contaminants  and extensive automation with continuous emission monitoring in some locations  among other means 
entrepreneurial management 
the company s senior management has extensive experience in the development and operation of district energy systems and cogeneration technologies  and has a track record of technical and financial innovation 
senior management as a group hold approximately percent of the company s outstanding common stock 
overview of the company s products and services the company s plants have the capacity to produce  mw equivalent of energy  of which approximately is steam or hot water  is electricity and is chilled water 
these products are distributed to customers through miles kilometers of pipeline  a substantial portion of which was in place when such systems were acquired by the company 
separate pipelines are used for steam  hot water and chilled water 
where electricity is produced with diesel or gas turbines  exhaust heat is recovered for production of additional electricity  steam or hot water and or chilled water 
in trigeneration plants  chilled water is produced using a compressor which is powered by the diesel or gas turbine used to produce electricity  steam or hot water 
because demand for steam and hot water has daily and yearly cycles  the company cannot always use all the waste heat generated by its plants to produce steam and hot water for immediate use 
trigeneration plants and innovative use of standard modular equipment enable the company to recover and use waste heat to produce electricity or chilled water for a longer period of time each day  during both summer and winter 
by generating two or three energy products from a single fuel source  cogeneration and trigeneration yield more useful energy output 
for example  the average electricity plant in the united states delivered an estimated of its fuel as useful energy in  releasing the remaining into the environment 
the company estimates that in the same year its systems converted approximately of their fuel to useful energy 
substantially all of the company s facilities have sufficient heating capacity so that they can generate peak loads even without their largest production unit in service  and have the ability to use two or more different types of fuel in their systems 
maintaining this capacity  which requires the company to increase steam generating capacity from time to time  has enabled the company to achieve high levels of reliability of service 
steam and hot water 
the company produces steam and or hot water at substantially all of its systems 
some of this is used internally to drive chillers  most is sold to customers for space heating and hot water  for cooling by powering on site steam driven chillers or absorption chillers  and for humidification  sterilization and various industrial process uses 
the states of maryland  massachusetts  missouri  new jersey and pennsylvania regulate the company s steam service 
maryland and pennsylvania require the company to seek state regulatory approval of the company s prices for steam service in those states 
missouri requires the company to seek state regulatory approval of the company s prices for steam service from the company s kansas city facilities 
massachusetts and new jersey do not require the company to seek state regulatory approval of the company s prices for steam service in those states 
electricity 
the company produces electricity at ten of its plants 
at each of these plants  all of the electricity produced is either sold to the local utility company or used by the company internally in the production of steam and hot water or to drive mechanical chillers 
the company s electric generating plants which sell their power are located in colorado  nassau county  philadelphia  trenton and kansas city 
each of these plants is qualified for an exemption from regulation qualifying facilities under the public utility regulatory policies act of purpa 
chilled water 
at eight of its facilities  the company produces chilled water  which is provided to customers to cool commercial building space and for process chilling 
chilled water is produced by converting the energy in hot water  steam  mechanical energy or electricity into chilled water through the use of absorption chillers and mechanical chillers 
an absorption chiller uses heat steam or hot water to concentrate lithium bromide  which when mixed with water absorbs heat and thus chills the water 
a mechanical chiller  driven by a steam turbine  electric motor  diesel engine or gas turbine  uses a compressor to compress refrigerant gases 
when such gases are expanded chilled water is produced 
the company adds chilling capacity to its systems in two ways it acquires chillers for operation in its central production facilities and it operates chillers leased from customers sometimes powering them with steam produced at the company s central plant 
the use of leased equipment permits the company to establish cooling systems and to add new customers with reduced capital investments 
in most cases  the chilled water is distributed through the company s energy system 
at present  the company owns the chillers used in london  ontario  tulsa and oklahoma city and leases the chillers used in nassau county 
in trenton and chicago  the company uses a combination of leased and owned equipment 
some customers also maintain on site chillers to serve solely as backup for their own buildings 
in these cases  the company may contract to operate such equipment for the customer and contract for the right to use such capacity to back up the company s chilled water production 
the company has signed contracts with the city of kansas city  missouri  jackson county  missouri  and the us general services administration to provide chilled water to eleven buildings in downtown kansas city 
the company expects to begin service under these contracts in may energy services 
the company also provides energy services to its customers  consisting of operating supervision  management and maintenance of facilities as well as advice and assistance regarding initial design  construction and start up  with respect to energy use as well as energy audits 
fuel and raw materials the company is a significant purchaser of gas  oil and biomass fuels  as well as chillers  boilers  generators and other equipment used for heating  cooling and electric generation 
most of the company s gas  oil and biomass fuel requirements  as well as most of its other supplies  are purchased from local suppliers 
the company believes that it has adequate sources of fuel  supplies and equipment 
competition provision of heating  electricity and cooling at existing systems the provision of heating  electricity and cooling services is highly competitive  although there are currently very few competing operators of multiple user district energy systems 
the company s principal thermal energy competition is from potential customers who own and operate their own boiler and chilled water plants  who are often encouraged to install and retain their own plants by the suppliers of raw energy such as local oil  natural gas and electricity companies and by equipment suppliers that sell products and services to users who self generate thermal energy 
in some cases utilities offer cash incentives to install equipment that will use their electricity or gas 
in several locations  local utilities are competing directly with the company through unregulated subsidiaries offering steam and or cooling 
the company believes that competition in each of these areas is primarily based on customers perceptions of cost savings and reliability of service 
the company competes to attract and retain customers  and also competes for contracts and other awards to develop new facilities and systems 
a significant additional factor is the high capital cost involved in constructing a district energy system 
while this factor provides a competitive advantage once the company is operating a completed system  high capital costs typically require the company to have a significant number of customers  preferably under long term contracts  prior to undertaking construction of a new cooling or heating system 
new projects the company competes directly with a large number of well capitalized independent power developers for new electric generation projects 
competition is based on technical skills  financing ability and market reputation  among other factors 
in the past  the company has not generally competed for single user cogeneration power development projects  but focused on multi customer district energy systems 
most of the company s cogeneration facilities are in the center of cities and relatively smaller and more expensive to build per unit of electric generation than plants built to produce the minimum heat recovery required to be certified as a qualifying facility 
the company selectively pursues generation opportunities where electricity is a by product of efficient heat and cooling production  providing electricity directly to industrial or commercial customers or selling it to electric utilities 
internationally  the company is prepared to pursue selected opportunities in nations where electricity demand is high and special conditions make fuel expensive  or where a customer s location or business favor a power project with high efficiency  reliability and waste heat recovery 
technology and year computer systems issues 
the company s research and development efforts have focused on efficient conversion of fuel to energy and on improved generating  monitoring  automation and storage technologies 
these efforts have resulted in the trigeneration machine  innovations in chilled water storage and control systems  innovative applications of standard modular equipment  and various incremental operational improvements 
expenditures for customer sponsored or company sponsored research and development are not separately reflected in the company s financial statements and the company believes that if such expenditures were so allocated  the amounts would not be material 
the company has been granted patents for the trigeneration machine  its freeze suppression chemical for stratified cold water storage and a fuel blending system for emissions control 
none of these patents are believed to be material 
many computer systems experience problems handling dates beyond december  therefore  the company plans to modify some of its computer software and hardware prior to the beginning of the year the company expects to successfully implement the systems and programming changes necessary to address the year issues 
the cost of such actions has not yet been determined  however  the company does not believe that such cost will have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
environmental the company s operations are subject to extensive federal  state  provincial and local environmental laws and regulations that govern  among other matters  emissions into the air  the discharge of effluents  the use of water  fuel tank management and the storage  handling and disposal of toxic waste material 
the company invests substantial funds to modify facilities to comply with applicable environmental laws and plans additional capital expenditures for these purposes in the future 
the company spent approximately million and million in and  respectively  to comply with these requirements and estimates that its expenditures for environmental compliance in through will be approximately million in the aggregate 
these expenditures include improvements at certain facilities for air emission control equipment as required by the united states clean air act  wastewater discharge control equipment  asbestos control and replacement of cfc refrigerants 
additional amounts to be spent for environmental control facilities in future years will depend on new laws and regulations and other changes in environmental concerns and legal requirements 
in  the united states environmental protection agency usepa adopted new regulations with respect to ozone levels in the atmosphere 
ozone levels increase with increases of oxides of nitrogen  and these are produced when burning fuels 
similarly  the usepa established a standard for another pollutant that is a by product of fuel combustion particulates that are less than microns in diameter 
both of these apply to emissions from existing  as well as future facilities in the us it is probable that some of the company s facilities will be effected as a result of these changes  however  until evaluations of air quality are completed for each location  and the states formulate  submit and receive approval for their implementation plans  the impact cannot be quantified 
when the previous ozone standard was promulgated  the impact on trigen was material 
employees as of december  the company had approximately employees  of whom were in the operating subsidiaries and at the corporate headquarters 
the company has collective bargaining agreements with the international union of operating engineers local in boston  local in chicago  local in nassau county  and local in trenton and the main unit of the canadian union of operating engineers in london  ontario 
these agreements cover    and employees  respectively  and expire in june  january  march  february and july  respectively 
the company believes that its relations with its employees are good

item legal proceedings oklahoma litigation in september  the company s subsidiary  trigen oklahoma city energy corporation trigen oklahoma city  commenced an antitrust action in federal district court in oklahoma city seeking injunctions and million in treble damages from the local utility  oklahoma gas and electric company og e based on many years of alleged anti competitive actions against trigen oklahoma city energy corporation by og e 
these actions culminated in criminal indictments being brought against two og e officials for allegedly bribing oklahoma elected officials to breach a trigen oklahoma city energy corporation contract 
og e has counterclaimed for million in damages  claiming that og e has been slandered by trigen oklahoma city in connection with the commencement of the action 
pretrial discovery is currently being conducted 
this case is not expected to come to trial before the end of kinetic energy litigation on may   following a jury trial in a suit by kinetic energy development corporation against the company in the circuit court of jackson county  missouri  in connection with the company s acquisition of the kansas city steam system  a judgment was entered against the company in the amount of  on august   the court set aside the jury verdict and granted judgment for the company

grays ferry litigation on march   grays ferry cogeneration partnership  trigen schuylkill cogeneration  inc  nrgg schuylkill cogeneration inc and trigen philadelphia energy corporation commenced an action against peco energy company peco  adwin schuylkill cogeneration  inc and the pennsylvania public utility commission in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania 
grays ferry cogeneration partnership the partnership is the owner of the grays ferry cogeneration facility located in philadelphia  pennsylvania 
the company has an investment of approximately million in the partnership  representing a one third interest in the partnership through its wholly owned subsidiary  trigen schuylkill cogeneration  inc nrgg schuylkill cogeneration inc 
and adwin schuylkill cogeneration  inc own the other two thirds interests in the partnership 
adwin schuylkill cogeneration  inc is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of peco 
the partnership commenced this action in reaction to the wrongful termination by peco on march   of the electric power purchase agreement between the partnership and peco 
the partnership is seeking a declaratory judgement to require peco to comply with the electric power purchase agreement and for damages to be proven at trial in an amount in excess of two hundred million dollars 
the partnership is also seeking a court order declaring any action taken by the pennsylvania public utility commission which would change the terms of the electric power purchase agreement between the grays ferry partnership and peco to be null and void 
trigen philadelphia energy corporation trigen philadelphia which operates a district steam heating system  purchases steam produced at the grays ferry cogeneration facility 
trigen philadelphia claims that peco s wrongful termination of its electric power purchase agreement with the grays ferry partnership constitutes tortious interference with trigen philadelphia s agreement to supply steam service to the university of pennsylvania  its largest customer 
on march   the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania dismissed this action before reaching the merits  determining that it did not have the required subject matter jurisdiction to hear the case 
on march   the partnership and trigen philadelphia filed a motion for reconsideration of the dismissal order and leave to file an amended complaint 
in the event that the court s order of dismissal is upheld  the partnership and trigen philadelphia would have the right to commence an action in state court and or to commence proceedings before the pennsylvania public utility commission 
on march   the chase manhattan bank issued a notice of default to the partnership under the terms of the credit agreement  dated as of march   between the partnership  the chase manhattan bank  as agent and certain other commercial banks 
that debt is secured only by the partnership assets and the partners ownership interests in the partnership 
while it is possible that the company s investment could become impaired  at this time the company does not believe that is likely 
the company believes that peco s termination of the electric power purchase agreement was wrongful and the company intends to aggressively pursue the remedies available to it 
the banks have not accelerated the debt and  on march   the chase manhattan bank commenced its own lawsuit against peco based upon peco s wrongful termination of the electric power purchase agreement 
in the event the company is not successful and peco s actions are upheld  peco would be required under purpa to continue to purchase power from the grays ferry cogeneration facility at peco s avoided cost 
this would generate significantly lower earnings per share for the company than the annual earnings per share of to previously forecasted by the company based on the contracted power purchase price 
other litigation the company is subject from time to time to various other claims that arise in the normal course of business  and the company believes that the outcome of these matters either individually or in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on the business results of operation or financial condition of the company

minority interest in earnings of subsidiaries 
earnings before income taxes and extraordinary item the company s preferred rate structures for thermal energy include fixed and variable components 
these rate structures are intended to cause revenues to match the company s costs of providing capacity  including projected debt service and return on equity  thermal losses in the distribution network  taxes  labor and scheduled maintenance and repair 
the capacity component  which is independent of usage in the period  generally includes cost escalation provisions 
these rate structures also contain a charge  which varies with usage during the period  and which is intended to cover directly variable costs  so as to pass through to customers the company s cost of fuel 
the company accounts for its operating expenses based on the average cost to produce and deliver thermal energy or electricity  on a system by system basis  over the course of the year 
a significant portion of the company s revenues and operating profit are subject to seasonal fluctuation due to peak heating demand in the winter and peak cooling demand in the summer 
this seasonal fluctuation is accentuated in those acquired steam systems where the company s preferred rate structures are not employed 
the company s strategy of converting old contracts to the company s preferred rate structures  adding cooling  electricity  energy services and industrial process loads will  if successful  reduce the concentration of revenues in cold months in the future 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december overview for the year ended december  net earnings were million compared with million in  and diluted earnings per common share were 
compared with per common share last year 
included in net earnings for was an extraordinary loss of million  or 
per common share  from the extinguishment of debt 
revenues of million were slightly less than the million in operating income was million and the operating margin was in compared with operating income of million and an operating margin of in excluding a condemnation award of million and a fee received on completion of a project financing of million  operating income was million and the operating margin was in the unusually mild winter weather  especially compared with the severe winter of  was a major factor for the lower levels of revenues and profits in revenues revenues of million were slightly less than the million in thermal energy revenue declined million or in to million 
units of thermal energy sold were down as energy systems in baltimore  boston and philadelphia were particularly affected by the milder weather 
contributing to the decline in thermal energy sales were lower fuel prices  which are passed on to customers 
electric energy sales were million in  an increase of million or 
this improvement was due to increased volume 
units of electric energy sold increased by  megawatt hours or 
in  the trigeneration plant in nassau county  ny  was operational for approximately additional hours 
this facility in was taken off line by the local utility and for an unplanned outage 
fees earned and other revenue increased in due to the expansion of the trigen ewing power operation  which was acquired in the first quarter of  and to the sale of a natural gas pipeline 
this increase was offset in part by costs incurred in connection with the establishment and marketing of new joint ventures with electric utilities to develop combined heat and power projects 
operating expenses fuels and consumables were million in compared with million last year 
this million decrease was due to the lower level of thermal energy revenues and to lower fuel prices 
offsetting in part the decline in fuels and consumables were increased running hours in for the nassau plant 
the company s rates typically enable it to pass changes in its fuel and most commodity costs to the customer 
as a result such changes have little impact on operating income 
fuel and consumables costs decreased from of revenues in to in production and operating costs are those costs incurred to operate the plants  other than fuel and consumables  and include labor and supervisory personnel  repair and maintenance costs  and plant operating costs 
production and operating costs increased to million compared with million in  and as a percent of revenues increased to from 
the higher costs resulted from expansion of trigen ewing power  a pipeline rupture in st 
louis and higher pension expense 
in addition  production and operating costs for were reduced by a million arbitration award 
offsetting the increase in part was lower repair and maintenance costs 
depreciation expense was million compared with million last year 
included in depreciation expense was a million gain resulting from a condemnation award 
excluding this gain  depreciation expense was higher by million due to the high level of capital expenditures in and general and administrative expenses increased million or in  mainly due to higher legal fees of million and severance and reorganization expenses of 
million 
also contributing to the increase were higher costs incurred in connection with the company s acquisition program 
as a percent of revenues  general and administrative expenses were in and in other income expense interest expense was million in compared with million in the reduction due to repaying high interest rate debt was more than offset by the higher level of debt in other income  net was 
million higher in due mainly to a 
million gain on the sale of marketable securities 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate is determined primarily by the federal statutory rate of  and state and local income taxes 
the effective tax rate was in and in year ended december  compared with year ended december overview net earnings for was million  equal to in diluted earnings per common share 
this compared with net earnings of million  or

factors contributing to the improved performance were the colder winter  the full year effect of two acquisitions made in and receipt of an additional gain of million in condemnation awards 
in september  the company in partnership with nations energy corporation acquired the energy production assets of coors brewing company 
also in  energy production facilities and distribution assets in charlottetown  prince edward island  canada were acquired 
revenues revenues were million in  an increase of million or  from million in the revenue increase resulting from the full year effect of the two acquisitions in was million 
the remaining increase was due to the colder winter in and to the increased price of fuel 
thermal energy revenue increased to million in  while units of thermal energy sold were up 
sales of electric energy were million in  a increase  and units of electric energy sold were higher by 
fees earned and other revenue were million in  an increase of over the acquisition of trigen ewing power and fees earned from the energy assets of coors brewing company were the factors contributing to this increase 
operating expenses fuel and consumables costs were million  or of revenues  in  compared to million  or of revenues  in  an increase of million 
this increase is due to the full year effect of the two acquisitions in the prior year and to the increased price of fuel 
production and operating costs increased to million from million in  and as a percentage of revenues decreased to from in production and operating costs were higher by million due to the full year impact of the acquisitions 
this increase was offset in part by labor productivity improvements and an arbitration award of million 
depreciation expense was million compared to million in  a decrease of million
