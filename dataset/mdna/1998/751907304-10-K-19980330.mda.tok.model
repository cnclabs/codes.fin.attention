the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information under item selected financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other financial data included elsewhere herein 
certain statements under this caption constitute forward looking statements under the reform act which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include but are not limited to i the timely completion of the development and qualification for manufacturing of the company s new edram and fram products  ii broader customer acceptance of its edram and esdram products and low density fram products  iii acceptance of new high density fram products  which may be developed  iv the company s and its alliance partners ability to manufacture its products on a cost effective and timely basis in the company s own facility and through its alliance foundry operations  v the company s ability to perform under existing alliance agreements and to develop new alliance and foundry relationships  vi the availability and related cost of future financing  vii the retention of key personnel  viii the outcome of the company s patent interference and litigation proceedings  and ix factors not directly related to the company  such as competitive pressures on pricing  marketing conditions in general  competition  technological progression  product obsolescence and the changing needs of potential customers and the semiconductor industry in general 
for additional information concerning these and other factors  see expected future results of operations in this item since its inception  the company has been primarily engaged in the research and development of ferroelectric technology and the design  development and commercialization of fram products and edram products 
the company has generated revenue under license and development agreements entered into with a limited number of established semiconductor manufacturers and involving the development of specific applications of the company s technologies 
revenue has also been derived from the sale of the company s fram and edram products beginning primarily in  and  prior to  from royalties resulting from the sale by a licensee of products incorporating the company s conventional dram technology 
accordingly  fluctuations in the company s revenues have resulted primarily from the timing of the signing of license and development agreements and the achievement of related performance milestones  and  to a lesser extent  upon the timing of significant product orders and royalty payments 
the company generated minimal revenue from fram and edram product sales prior to for  and  fram product sales represented approximately  and of total product sales revenue  respectively  while edram product sales accounted for  and  respectively  for the same periods 
during such periods  product sales revenue accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of total revenues  the remainder of which were generated principally from license and development fees and in from royalties earned on conventional dram product sales by nippon steel 
as a result of the company s limited revenues as compared to its substantial ongoing product research and development costs and high manufacturing costs  the company has incurred losses in each fiscal year since its inception and  prior to  required substantial capital infusions from its principal stockholders in the form of debt and equity financing 
the company has entered into development and licensing arrangements with several major semiconductor manufacturers  namely hitachi  rohm  toshiba  fujitsu  and ibm to advance the development of both its fram products and edram products and to provide the company with access to advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes and capacity for such products 
in december  the company also entered into a license agreement with samsung  although such arrangement does not include any development activities between the company and samsung or the availability of manufacturing capacity to the company from samsung 
in addition to these licensing and or development arrangements  in december  the company entered into a fram development agreement with asahi and in february  the company entered into a esdram manufacturing foundry agreement with siemens  neither one of which currently includes a license to the company s fram or edram technology 
results of operations revenues 
in  product sales revenues decreased by approximately over product sales revenues in to a total of million  consisting of sales of million of fram products and million of edram products  compared to total product sales revenues during of million from the sale of million of fram products and million of edram products 
the decrease in product sales revenue in as compared with resulted primarily from a decrease in the average selling prices of the company s edram products 
even though a decrease in edram revenue was recorded in  the actual number of edram units shipped during increased slightly over shipment levels 
the decrease in fram product revenues during resulted from a decrease in product availability from the company s captive manufacturing facility in colorado springs 
this decrease in product availability was driven primarily by the company s desire to maintain quarterly fram product revenues in the  to  range until low cost volume fram production becomes available through the company s fram alliance partners 
in  product sales revenues increased by approximately over product sales revenues in which totaled million and consisted of sales of million of fram products and million of edram products 
the increase in product sales revenue in as compared with resulted primarily from an increase in the availability of the company s edram products from its manufacturing source during the increase in edram product availability enabled the company to fulfill  during the first two quarters of  a substantial customer order backlog that existed at the end of increases in the volume of edram products shipped during to new and existing customers was tempered by a decrease in product average selling prices during the year 
increases in fram product revenue during resulted from the increased availability of fram products and increases in volumes of fram products sold associated with the company s kilobit fram products and rfid fram products 
in  and  the company recognized license and development fee revenues of million  million and million  respectively 
the company s license fee revenues during resulted from the achievement of milestones pursuant to an existing license arrangement with fujitsu and from the company entering into a new fram development agreement with asahi 
the company s license and development fee revenues during resulted from the achievement of milestones pursuant to existing license arrangements  the granting of a new license for the use of the company s ferroelectric technology and the granting of fram product designs to an existing licensee 
revenues from licensing activities during were recognized from hitachi  rohm  toshiba  fujitsu and samsung 
the company s license fee revenue for resulted from the grant of licenses in the company s ferroelectric technology to toshiba  fujitsu  hitachi and rohm  and to racom and intag for use in certain rfid applications 
in and the company recorded no royalty revenues 
in  the company recorded royalty revenues of million from nippon steel s sales of conventional dram products designed and developed by the company 
the royalty revenue recognized during  represents the payment of all royalties payable by nippon steel on sales of conventional megabit and megabit dram products subsequent to that payment was made in connection with the may sale to nippon steel of the company s equity interest in united memories  inc umi  a joint venture company formed by ramtron and nippon steel to design and develop advanced semiconductor memory products 
under the terms of the umi sale agreement  the company will not receive additional royalty revenue from nippon steel for periods subsequent to the company enters into customer sponsored research and development activities primarily as a means to further the development of its technology with certain strategic partners or customers 
revenues from such activities were   and  in   and  respectively 
costs related to such activities were   and  in   and  respectively 
cost of product sales 
in  and  cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenues were  and  respectively 
the improvement in the cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenues in over the same period in relates directly to the company s edram products 
lower supply costs for the company s edram products were the primary reason leading to the improved cost of product sales percentage for cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenues for edram products is expected to continue to improve during as the company s production costs decrease 
the expected improvement in the cost of edram product sales is directly related to the company s ability to maintain reasonable average selling prices at levels comparable or slightly under the average selling price levels which existed at the end of  although there can be no assurance the company will be able to maintain such average selling prices during the improvement in the cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenues in over the same period in also relates directly to the company s edram products 
increased sales volume  favorable average selling prices and lower supply costs for the company s edram products were the primary reasons leading to the improved cost of product sales percentage for the cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenues for the company s fram products was approximately for each of  and the overall cost of product sales has remained high due primarily to the company s introduction of new fram and edram product designs  low volume of manufacturing and changes in the manufacturing processes 
furthermore  the low manufacturing volume of fram products has resulted in higher costs associated with the company s cmos underlayer supply and external packaging and testing services 
improvements in the cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenues for fram products are expected during resulting from the company receiving product from the advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes and facilities of the company s foundry alliances  assuming successful completion of development and product qualification 
the expected improvement in the cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenues for the company s edram products is expected to occur as a result of an overall cost improvement from the company s foundries as their prices to the company are adjusted downward in relation to standard dram pricing 
research and development 
in  research and development expenses decreased by million as compared with the same period in  due primarily to the absence of the expense associated with a non cash  non recurring employee incentive program approved by the company s stockholders in december and terminated in december such research and development incentive expense totaled approximately million in when comparing to  absent the employee incentive expense of million  research and development expenses would have decreased by approximately 
million or 
the decrease in research and development costs in is primarily related to a decrease in design and development costs for new products and processes associated with the company s colorado springs manufacturing facility 
such decreases were the result of the company s focus on product development activities through its fram alliance partners and utilizing their manufacturing facilities 
these decreases were partially offset by higher repairs and maintenance costs required to maintain the company s aging fabrication equipment in its colorado springs facility 
research and development expenses for are expected to remain consistent with levels 
in  research and development expenses increased by million as compared with the same period in  due primarily to the expensing of the non recurring  non cash employee incentive program mentioned above 
the absence of the million incentive expense in would have resulted in a decrease in research and development expenses in as compared to the same period in of approximately 
million 
approximately 
million of such incentive expense was recorded in the decrease in research and development costs in compared with absent the incentive expense is primarily related to a decrease in manufacturing volumes associated with the company s research and development activities 
sales  general and administrative 
in  sales  general and administrative expenses decreased by million compared to due primarily to the absence of the expense associated with a non cash  non recurring employee incentive program approved by the company s stockholders in december and terminated in december such research and development incentive expense totaled approximately million in when comparing to  absent the employee incentive expense of million  sales  general and administrative expenses would have decreased by approximately 
million or  primarily resulting from a decrease in withholding taxes associated with the company s license and development arrangements 
in  sales  general and administrative expenses increased by 
million as compared with the same period in  due primarily to the expensing of the employee incentive program mentioned above 
the absence of the incentive expense in of million would have resulted in a decrease in sales  general and administrative expenses in as compared to the same period in of approximately 
million 
such decrease in sales  general and administrative expenses in compared to the same period in absent the incentive expense relates primarily to a decrease in withholding taxes associated with the company s licensing and royalty arrangements 
increases in product sales commissions paid to distributors and sales representatives during associated with increased product sales revenues partially offset such decreases in sales  general and administrative expenses mentioned above 
interest expense 
in  interest expense  related party increased by approximately over resulting from interest accrued on additional borrowings totaling million from a credit facility provided by the fund 
such additional borrowings occurred during the last four months of in  interest expense  related party decreased by million as compared with such decrease was primarily due to the conversion of debt to equity of approximately million of related party notes payable and associated accrued interest  pursuant to a debt conversion agreement 
gain on disposition of equity investments 
in  the company recorded a gain of 
million on the disposition of its equity investment in umi 
in may  the company entered into an agreement with nippon steel whereby the company sold to nippon steel for million all of ramtron s voting and nonvoting common stock in umi 
other income expense 
in  the company recognized income associated with the collection of a 
million receivable written off in the previous year 
the recognition of this income was the primary reason for the 
million increase in other income expense in compared to expected future results of operations the company is continuing its efforts to improve and increase commercial production and sales of its edram products and low density fram products  decrease the cost of producing such products and develop and commercialize new high and low density fram products and enhancements to its existing fram and edram products 
the company expects revenues will continue to be sporadic in the foreseeable future until the company s products gain wider market acceptance  new license arrangements are entered into and milestones under the company s existing and any new license and development agreements are achieved 
the company s ability to significantly increase product sales and achieve profitability will depend on several factors  including i the completion of the development and qualification for manufacturing of the company s high density fram products  ii the completion of the development and qualification for manufacturing of the company s new edram products  iii wider customer acceptance of its edram products and low density fram products  iv market acceptance of new high and low density fram products which may be developed  v the company s ability to manufacture its products on a cost effective and timely basis in its own facility and through alliance foundry operations and third party foundry sources  vi the availability and related cost of future financing  and vii factors not directly related to the company  including market conditions  competition  technological progression  product obsolescence and the changing needs of potential customers and the semiconductor industry in general 
to gain access to advanced cmos manufacturing processes and facilities  ramtron has entered into manufacturing alliances and licensing agreements for fram products with companies having or constructing advanced memory products manufacturing capability  including rohm  hitachi  toshiba and fujitsu 
since the purchase or construction of an advanced manufacturing facility capable of mass producing memory devices would require a capital outlay well beyond the company s current capital resources  the company believes that the most suitable alternative is this strategic alliance approach which the company believes will enable it to develop  manufacture and sell fram products more rapidly and cost effectively than any other available alternative 
ramtron s intention is to utilize current and future alliance relationships as foundry sources for fram products in order to provide the company with low cost  high volume  high quality fram products for resale to customers 
the company is also exploring opportunities with potential and existing licensing partners to have such partners update the company s existing fabrication facility in colorado springs by providing state of the art manufacturing equipment in lieu of license and development payments and then sharing research and development improvements and or manufacturing output of such facility 
the company signed a memorandum of understanding mou in august with sgs thomson incorporating terms similar to these  but no definitive agreement concerning such facility upgrade exists at this time and there can be no assurance that a final agreement incorporating such terms will be entered into 
see business development and manufacturing alliances above 
the company intends to produce edrams through strategic alliances and foundry arrangements with major semiconductor companies and to expand the market for edrams by making edram products available from multiple sources 
this approach avoids the high capital costs associated with dram manufacturing that would have otherwise been incurred by the company if it had chosen to manufacture these products with company provided resources 
year the company utilizes software and related technologies throughout its business and relies on suppliers of services and materials that will be affected by the date change in the year or prior 
the year issue exists because many computer systems and applications currently use two digit fields to designate a year 
as the century date change occurs  date sensitive systems will recognize the year as  or not at all 
this inability to recognize or properly treat the year may cause systems to process critical financial and operational information incorrectly 
an internal study is currently under way to determine the full scope and related costs to insure that the company s systems continue to meet its internal needs and those of its customers 
the company will begin to incur expenses in to resolve this issue 
these expenses will be quantified with the study and may be significant and continue through the year liquidity and capital resources since its inception  because revenues generated from operations and licensing have been insufficient to fund operations  the company has depended for funding principally on its stockholders  and in particular from until february on oren l 
benton benton  a former principal stockholder and director and the former chief executive officer of the company  and since on the national electrical benefit fund the fund  a principal stockholder of the company 
benton and the fund financed the company s cash flow requirements through equity investments and loans  most of which were subsequently converted into equity 
as a result of mr 
benton s bankruptcy in  the company ceased to rely on mr 
benton as a source of financing 
the company also raised funds through the private placement of convertible preferred stock in  all of which has been converted into common stock 
in  the company entered into a debt conversion agreement providing for i the conversion into equity of an aggregate of approximately million of the company s outstanding debt held collectively by mr 
benton  the fund and bea associates  inc bea as the holder by assignment of a note issued by the company to mr 
benton in in the original principal amount of million  and ii a new loan facility between the company and the fund of up to million which included million made available under a credit facility the fund had provided to the company in march 
in december  additional outstanding debt of the company held by mr 
benton in the amount of approximately million was also converted into equity pursuant to the debt conversion agreement 
during and  the company s borrowings under the fund s credit facility increased to a total principal and accrued interest amount outstanding on december   of approximately million 
in december  the company sold approximately million of common stock  and in february  the company sold approximately million of series a preferred stock  to certain institutional investors in separate private placements in order to obtain funds for working capital and general corporate purposes 
cash and cash equivalents increased by million in to million 
the company generated million from financing activities in  which was offset by the use of million in operating activities and million in investing activities 
the million generated from financing activities resulted from of proceeds generated from the sale of common stock in a private placement and from million of new borrowings pursuant to the fund s credit facility 
the use of million for investing activities was for the purchase of computer and fabrication equipment used in the design and manufacturing of the company s fram and edram products and for office expansion purposes 
receivables decreased by million in from million at the end of to million at the end of the decrease in the receivables balance is primarily due to the collection of a million receivable in january resulting from a new fram license agreement completed in december receivables from product sales increased at the end of as a result of strong edram product sales during the last two months of inventories decreased by in from million at the end of to million at the end of inventory levels remained high at the end of as the company increased its production of megabit edram products in anticipation of a scale down in production during from one of its megabit foundry sources  nippon steel 
ibm will continue to supply megabit edram products for the company during and ibm and siemens will be suppliers for the company s megabit esdram products 
accounts payable increased by million from million at the end of to million at the end of this increase resulted primarily from work in process increases during the fourth quarter of associated with edram manufacturing at nippon steel 
during  the company invested million in computer and fabrication equipment and office expansion 
this was an increase of approximately 
million over and resulted primarily from the growth in the company s internal design resources supporting the company s edram products 
increases in property  plant and equipment are expected to increase slightly during as both fram and edram design resources continue to expand 
fabrication equipment and plant expenditures are expected to be minimal during as the company shifts its manufacturing of fram products to its fram alliance partners 
during  the company received approximately million including million which was included in accounts receivable as of december  in cash relating to a december new fram licensing agreement  milestone achievements from an existing fram licensee and a new fram development agreement 
milestone payments pursuant to existing licensing agreements are expected to create additional cash flows during and subject to the fulfillment of certain milestone conditions 
an increase in product sales activity and new license arrangements are anticipated in based on the company s capital resources as of december   the million of proceeds from the recent sale of series a preferred stock see note in notes to consolidated financial statements  and expected operating costs and cash flows from product sales and licensing revenues  the company expects to be able to fund its operations through year end all amounts outstanding under the fund s credit facility  repayment of which is secured by liens on the company s facility and certain other of its assets  are due and payable on june  the company has requested an extension of the payment date or conversion into equity of amounts outstanding under the credit facility 
if such extension is not granted and the conversion into equity is not made by the fund  the company will have to repay all principal and accrued interest under the credit facility  which will use a substantial portion of the company s capital resources  however  the assets pledged as collateral under the fund credit facility would be released and available as security to new lenders 
in view of the company s expected future working capital requirements in connection with the manufacturing  production and sale of its fram and edram products  the company s projected continuing research and development expenditures and the current repayment requirements of the fund s credit facility  the company may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing after there is no assurance  however  that the company will be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to the company  or that the fund will agree to an extension of the payment date  or conversion into equity of amounts owed  under the fund s credit facility 
if the company requires additional financing in the future and if financing acceptable to the company is not available  the company would not be able to implement its current business strategy and the company s business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected
