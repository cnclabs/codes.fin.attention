overview the company designs  develops  manufactures  markets and services chemical mechanical planarization  or cmp  systems used in the fabrication of semiconductor devices as well as other high throughput precision surface processing equipment used in the fabrication of thin film memory disk media  semiconductor wafers and general industrial components 
in addition  the company markets and distributes parts and expendables and slurries 
the company s total revenue consists of net sales in two business segments i equipment  parts and expendables  and ii slurries  as well as commissions earned on the distribution in the us and europe of products manufactured by the far east joint venture 
sales of the company s products are recorded upon shipment or when the product is accepted by the customer  provided that no significant obligations remain outstanding and collection of the related receivable is deemed probable 
the company accrues estimated warranty and installation expenses for each equipment and system order at the time the order is shipped 
equipment  parts and expendables consist of capital equipment manufactured by the company  spare parts for that equipment and expendable products  such as bearings  grinding stones  lapping plates  workpiece carriers  seals  retaining rings  workholders and polishing pads 
during fiscal years   and    and respectively  of the company s net sales was attributable to the sale of capital equipment  parts and expendables 
historically  the gross margin for products in this segment has been significantly higher than that for slurries 
the company began development of its original cmp product  the cmp v  in the company initiated volume shipments of the cmp v in shipments of the auriga began in fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal  the company began shipments of its latest cmp enhancement  the auriga c 
through may   the company had sold auriga c systems 
the company s cmp systems accounted for  and  of net sales for fiscal   and respectively 
the company s cmp systems generally have higher gross margins than those of the company s other capital equipment products 
slurries consist of polishing slurry and slurry components including vehicles and abrasives used in surface processing 
during fiscal years   and   and  respectively  of the company s net sales was attributable to the sale of slurries 
substantially all of the slurries sold by the company are manufactured by fujimi incorporated 
historically  the gross margin for slurries has been significantly lower than that for equipment  parts and expendables 
in recent years  the company has experienced severe competitive pressure in the sale of slurries and has been required to reduce prices 
in addition  the company has experienced increased slurry costs 
commissions from affiliate commissions consist primarily of revenue derived from the distribution by the company in the us and europe of products manufactured by the far east joint venture for which the company acts as sales agent 
certain capital equipment marketed and distributed by the company is produced solely by the far east joint venture 
the company distributes such products throughout the us and europe and receives commissions thereon 
such amount reflects the difference between the imported equipment s cost to the company and sales price to the customer 
for fiscal   and  commissions accounted for    respectively  of total revenue 
commissions are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations which can significantly impact operating profit margins 
in fiscal   and   and  respectively  of the company s total revenue was attributable to sales outside of the united states 
in particular  in fiscal  of the company s total revenue was attributable to sales made to european markets and was attributable to sales to markets in the far east 
the company generally enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies  principally in japanese yen 
the terms of the contracts are rarely more than one year 
currency exchange rate variations have had an immaterial effect on the company s results of operations for the periods presented 
the results of operations of the company s subsidiaries and its equity in the net earnings of the far east joint venture are translated for financial statement purposes based upon average exchange rates during the period covered 
as a result  fluctuations in exchange rates may have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
net assets of the company s foreign subsidiaries and of the net assets of the far east joint venture were approximately million at april  the end of fiscal of such entities 
the company owns a interest in both the far east joint venture and the fujimi joint venture 
the company s equity interest in each joint venture is accounted for on the equity method 
as a result  the company s share of the net earnings of the far east joint venture and the fujimi joint venture appear in the equity in net earnings of affiliates caption on the company s consolidated statements of earnings 
the far east joint venture and the fujimi joint venture have paid dividends in the past and may continue to do so in the foreseeable future  but are expected to reinvest substantially all their earnings back into their respective businesses 
the company s share of the net earnings of the far east joint venture has not in the past resulted and is not expected in the future to result in a like effect on the cash flows of the company 
at may   the company s equity interest in the far east joint venture was million  representing of the company s total assets and of stockholders equity 
the net earnings of the company in the past have been substantially influenced by the results of operations of the far east joint venture and can be expected to continue to be so influenced in the future

results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of earnings data for the periods indicated as a percentage of total revenue years ended may  revenue net sales commissions from affiliate total revenue cost of sales gross margin operating expenses research  development and engineering selling  general and administrative operating profit other income expense earnings from consolidated companies before income taxes income tax expense earnings from consolidated companies equity in net earnings of affiliates net earnings fiscal compared with fiscal net sales 
net sales for the fiscal year ended may  were million  up over net sales of million in fiscal equipment  parts and expendables accounted for of net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal the dollar growth in this segment was attributable to higher sales of the company s cmp planarization systems to the semiconductor industry 
in addition  the average selling price of the cmp systems increased over the prior year due to a shift in product mix to the auriga and the auriga c from the cmp v in fiscal sales of cmp systems totaled million  or of net sales  up over the million of cmp system sales in fiscal however  the company believes that there has been a slowdown in overall demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment including cmp systems  which has slowed sales to the semiconductor device market worldwide 
this slowdown is a result of excess production capacity in both the dram and logic segment and resultant decreasing device prices within the dram market segment 
as a result  semiconductor manufacturers are expected to reduce or delay their investment in manufacturing equipment 
in addition  the semiconductor device market has been affected by the conditions surrounding the economic health of asian countries  particularly korea and japan 
the company believes that these market and economic uncertainties will likely have an adverse effect on sales of cmp systems at least through the next fiscal year 
sales of equipment to the thin film memory disk market declined from the prior year 
the technology for the production of thin film memory disks has shifted to the use of alternative substrates  a majority of those substrates being produced by far east manufacturers 
consequently  thin film memory disk manufactures headquartered in the united states have experienced manufacturing over capacity which in turn has reduced capital spending for equipment the company supplies from its us operations 
the company expects these manufacturing over capacity problems to continue in the us through the next fiscal year 
sales of slurries increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percent of net sales  sales of slurries remained relatively unchanged at in fiscal compared to in fiscal european net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal commissions from affiliate 
commissions from affiliate decreased to million in the year ended may   compared to million in the year ended may  the decrease in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due not only to the continued slowdown in the thin film memory disk market  but also to a global decrease in orders of capital equipment from the silicon wafer market related to manufacturing over capacity due to slowing demand for wafers produced by that industry 
the company believes that capital equipment spending will further decline in the thin film memory disk and silicon wafer industries in the next fiscal year  in turn lowering commissions from affiliate 
gross margin 
in fiscal  gross margin was million  or of total revenue  compared to million  or of total revenue  in fiscal gross margin increased primarily due to the increased sales of cmp systems in fiscal however  the impact of improved gross margins due to higher sales of cmp systems was mostly offset by declining gross margins on sales to the thin film memory disk industry  declining slurry margins and lower commission revenue compared to fiscal gross margin was also impacted by additional warranty expense accrued in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to the increasing complexity of the company s cmp products  and the importance of maintaining customer good will in the current competitive environment  management made the decision in the fourth quarter of fiscal year to accrue for additional equipment warranty to cover the anticipated customer service costs of its cmp products 
research  development and engineering 
in the year ended may   research  development and engineering expense increased to million  or of total revenue  compared to million  or of total revenue  in fiscal the increase in both the dollar amount and the percentage of total revenue is a result of the company s significant investment in dry in dry out  end point detection and mm planarization capabilities for its cmp systems  improvements in cmp systems reliability and productivity  and various process technologies for the semiconductor device  thin film memory disk and silicon wafer markets 
in addition  the company has committed significant technical support resources to meet the needs of its customers 
even though these investments negatively impacted operating profits in fiscal  the company will continue to invest in research  development  and engineering to maintain technological competitiveness and meet the process requirements of its customers 
selling  general and administrative 
in fiscal  selling  general and administrative expense increased to million from million in fiscal in fiscal  selling  general and administrative expense increased as a percent of total revenue to from in fiscal this increase in selling  general and administrative expense reflects continued investments in the sales and administrative infrastructure  as well as increased commissions paid to the far east joint venture as a result of increased sales of cmp systems produced by the company in the us and exported to pacific rim customers through the far east joint venture 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  selling  general and administrative expense also included an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable due to possible exposures in the far east as well as severance compensation related to reductions in the company s workforce which were made during the quarter 
other income expense 
other income increased to million in fiscal from  of other expense in fiscal other income expense consisted primarily of interest income in fiscal interest income increased substantially in fiscal as a result of the cash infusions from the company s two successful equity offerings in february and october of calendar year provision for income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate in fiscal was  compared to in fiscal the company s effective income tax rate in fiscal differs from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of state taxes  net of the us federal benefit  more than offset by the tax benefit from a foreign sales corporation and tax exempt investment securities 
equity in net earnings of affiliates 
for the year ended may   equity in net earnings of affiliates decreased to million compared to million in the year ended may  revenue of the far east joint venture grew in fiscal from the same period a year ago 
however  net earnings of the far east joint venture were down from the prior year due to competitive pricing pressures for the automated disk polishing systems  which negatively impacted gross margins  combined with higher costs of producing and servicing these systems 
the company believes that the earnings of the far east joint venture may be adversely affected for at least the next fiscal year by both the slow down in demand for equipment sold into the thin film memory disk and silicon wafer markets  as well as the current economic and currency crises facing several asian economies 
restructuring costs of approximately  were incurred by the far east joint venture during fiscal in connection with the reorganization of its asian operations which included the closing of the malaysia and thailand subsidiaries in july of fiscal compared with fiscal net sales 
net sales for the fiscal year ended may  were million  up over net sales of million in fiscal equipment  parts and expendables accounted for of net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal the growth in this segment was attributable to higher sales of the company s cmp planarization systems to the semiconductor industry 
sales of cmp systems totaled million  or of net sales  more than double the million of cmp system sales in fiscal in addition to the significant increase in cmp equipment sales to semiconductor manufacturers  net sales for the fiscal year increased due to a higher level of sales of equipment  parts and expendables to the thin film memory disk media market 
sales of slurries increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal however  as a percent of net sales  sales of slurries decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal european sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal commissions from affiliate 
commissions from affiliate increased to million in the year ended may   compared to million in the year ended may  the increase in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due primarily to increased demand in the silicon wafer industry for polishing systems developed and manufactured by the far east joint venture 
in addition  sales of cleaning and polishing systems  also produced by the far east joint venture  to customers in the thin film memory disk media market increased significantly in fiscal over fiscal commissions from affiliate also improved over the prior year due to improved margins on import machines 
gross margin 
in fiscal  gross margin was million  or of total revenue  compared to million  or of total revenue  in fiscal in addition to higher sales levels  gross margin has increased due to a continuing increase in sales of higher margin equipment  particularly systems for the planarization of semiconductor devices 
in addition  higher commission revenue contributed to the increased gross margins in fiscal research  development and engineering 
in the year ended may   research  development and engineering expense increased to million  or of total revenue  compared to million  or of total revenue  in fiscal the increase in both the dollar amount and as a percent of total revenue is a result of the continued investment in the development of the cmp process and products for key markets  particularly for the semiconductor sector  and the increase in the company s field support organization throughout the world 
such expenditures resulted in the development and sale of the auriga  and the development of a post cmp cleaning technology 
selling  general and administrative 
in fiscal  selling  general and administrative expense increased to million from million in fiscal in fiscal  selling  general and administrative expense increased as a percent of total revenue to from in fiscal higher levels of spending were required to support the sales growth in fiscal this increase in selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue reflects continued investments in the sales and administrative infrastructure  as well as increased commissions paid to the far east joint venture as a result of increased sales of cmp systems produced by the company in the us and exported to pacific rim customers though its joint venture affiliate 
other income expense 
other expense increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal other income expense includes charges associated with the company s public common stock offering in the first quarter of fiscal which was subsequently canceled  interest expense  miscellaneous expenses and interest income 
provision for income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate in fiscal was  compared to in fiscal the company s effective income tax rate in fiscal differs from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of state taxes  net of the us federal benefit offset by the tax benefit from a foreign sales corporation and research and development tax credits 
equity in net earnings of affiliates 
for the year ended may   equity in net earnings of affiliates increased to million compared to million in the year ended may  primarily as a result of continued strong demand for products sold to the thin film memory disk and semiconductor wafer industries by the far east joint venture 
in addition  the company s share of the net earnings of the fujimi joint venture was significantly higher than in fiscal due to increased sales and improved margins realized during fiscal on slurry products sold by the fujimi joint venture to the us silicon wafer market 
liquidity and capital resources as of may   the company had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  compared to million at may  the company used million of cash in operating activities 
net earnings adjusted for non cash depreciation and amortization and equity in the net earnings of affiliates provided in cash 
however  investments in working capital used million primarily due to growth in inventories  accounts receivable and decreases in accrued expenses  customer deposits and income taxes payable 
during fiscal  inventories increased as a result of customer requests to delay shipments of cmp systems until fiscal also  orders built on speculation for delivery in the fourth quarter of fiscal were not received due to customer cutbacks in capital spending 
accounts receivable increased from the prior year due to more of the company s products being sold into geographic regions with longer collection periods  especially the far east 
in addition  average collection times increased as customers extended times to evaluate new tool introductions and enhancements 
in fiscal  million of cash was used in investing activities primarily for net purchases of short term investments and capital expenditures 
the company made capital expenditures of million primarily to purchase machinery and equipment  land  computer equipment and software and complete payments for the construction of the corporate headquarters in chandler  arizona 
the company currently anticipates capital expenditures of approximately million for fiscal of this amount  million is expected to be used to complete construction on a new  square foot technology center next to the corporate headquarters in chandler  arizona 
the company has financed its growth in recent years primarily from the issuance of common stock 
in october of  the company completed a public offering of common stock 
the company issued  shares of common stock and received net proceeds of million 
in addition  for the year ended may   million was provided by the sale of stock to employees through the company s employee stock purchase plan and through the exercise of stock options 
also available to the company is a million credit facility negotiated in august of with its us bank group 
the term of the note is for three years 
as of august   no amounts were outstanding on this loan facility 
in addition  the company has a l  million unsecured  multi currency  revolving line of credit with the london branch of a us bank 
as of august   no amounts were outstanding on this credit facility 
the company believes that its current cash position and the current bank lines of credit will be sufficient to meet the company s cash needs during the next months

effective june  year the company is addressing the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the millennium year approaches 
the year problem is pervasive and complex as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way 
the company is aware of and is addressing the potential computing difficulties that may be triggered by the year the company has commenced a year date review and conversion project to address all the necessary changes  testing and implementation issues 
the project encompasses three major areas of review internal systems hardware and software  supplier compliance and company products 
the company has identified the changes required to its computer programs and hardware 
the necessary modifications to the company s centralized financial  manufacturing and operational information systems are expected to be completed by the end of calendar year to date  the company s suppliers have been sent letters requesting information regarding their own year plan  as well as requesting confirmation that the components supplied by these vendors are year compliant 
the company has evaluated the vendor responses which have been received and concluded that the vendors which have responded either are year compliant or are proceeding with their own year compliance programs 
the company will continue to follow up with vendors with which the company has a material relationship and who have not responded to obtain assurances that they expect to be year compliant in time 
equipment and systems manufactured and supplied by the company have been evaluated and determined to be free of any material problems that could be caused by the year issue 
management estimates that the company s remaining year compliance expense will be approximately  to date  the company believes that year problems related to its own internal systems and equipment and systems it sells will not have a material effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies upon which the company s systems and business rely will be timely converted or that any such failure to convert by another company would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial conditions or results of operations 
to date  the management of the far east joint venture has  in response to a request by the company  completed a review of their year compliance issue and has determined that there is not expected to be material adverse effects on its results of operations as a result thereof 
certain factors affecting the company s business discussed below are certain factors which may affect the company s business 
this discussion is not exclusive of other factors that may also affect the company s business and should be read in conjunction with the other information contained in this form k including  without limitation  information provided in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on cmp systems the company believes that its future growth  if any  depends in large part upon its ability to grow revenues attributable to its cmp systems and its technology 
revenue growth attributable to the company s cmp systems depends upon numerous factors  including cost of ownership  throughput  process flexibility  performance and reliability and availability of customer support 
the company intends to periodically develop and introduce enhanced versions of its cmp system 
failure to continually develop the company s cmp system may impact its ability to grow revenue attributable to its cmp systems 
in addition  the continuing slow down in the semiconductor industry impacts the company s ability to recognize consistent growth in revenue attributable to cmp systems 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in growing revenue attributable to its current cmp systems  or any future enhanced version of the system 
the failure of the company to accomplish these objectives would have a material adverse effect on the company 
see dependence on new product development  rapid technological change 
dependence on new product development  rapid technological change the company believes that its future success will depend  in part  on its ability to enhance existing products and processes and develop and manufacture new products and processes 
the markets in which the company and its customers compete are characterized by evolving industry standards and frequent improvements in products and services 
to compete effectively in such markets  the company must continually improve its products and its process technologies and develop new technologies and products that compete effectively on the basis of price and performance 
the company expects to continue to make significant investments in research  development and engineering even during economic down turns in the markets the company serves  or if such investments negatively impact operating profits in a reporting period 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to improve its existing products and its process technologies or develop new products and technologies 
the company intends to continually develop and or introduce enhanced versions of its integrated cmp system 
there can be no assurance that the company s development of new or enhanced products  such as enhanced versions of the cmp system  will be cost effective or introduced in a timely manner or accepted in the marketplace 
failure by the company to develop or introduce new products and product enhancements in a timely manner would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
due to the complexity of the company s products  significant delays can occur between a system s introduction and the commencement of commercial shipments 
the company has from time to time experienced delays in the introduction of  and certain technical and manufacturing difficulties with  certain of its systems and enhancements  and may experience such delays and technical and manufacturing difficulties in future introductions or volume production of new systems or enhancements 
in addition  the company may incur substantial unanticipated costs to ensure the functionality and reliability of its future product introductions early in the product s life cycle 
if new products experience reliability or quality problems  the company could encounter a number of problems  including reduced orders  higher manufacturing costs  delays in collection of accounts receivable and additional service and warranty expenses  each of which could materially adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
in addition  in the event the company does not manage product transitions successfully  sales of existing company products could be adversely affected 
see business research  development and engineering 
cyclical nature of the company s business the company s business depends substantially on the capital expenditures of semiconductor  thin film memory disk media and silicon wafer manufacturers its primary markets  which  in turn  depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductor devices  memory disks and silicon wafers 
sales of capital equipment to these manufacturers are expected to continue to represent a significant portion of the company s total revenue 
these industries are highly cyclical and have historically experienced periodic downturns characterized by oversupply and weak demand  which often have a material adverse effect on the acquisition of capital equipment and other products used in the manufacturing process  including products offered by the company 
these downturns generally have materially adversely affected the business and operating results of capital equipment suppliers  including the company 
the semiconductor  thin film memory disk and silicon wafer industries are currently experiencing downturns which have led many semiconductor  memory disk and silicon wafer manufacturers to delay or cancel capital expenditures 
the company s business and results of operations will continue to be materially adversely affected by these downturns in its primary markets 
sales of the company s capital equipment depend  in large part  upon the decision of a prospective customer to increase manufacturing capacity or respond to advances in technology by upgrading or expanding existing manufacturing facilities or constructing new manufacturing facilities  all of which typically involve a significant capital commitment 
certain of the company s capital equipment have lengthy sales cycles while the customer evaluates and receives approvals for the purchase of the company s systems and completes the upgrading or expansion of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities 
the company may expend substantial funds and management effort during the sales cycle 
the cyclicality and rapid technological change present in certain of the industries served by the company may also cause prospective customers to postpone decisions regarding major capital expenditures  including purchases of the company s equipment 
in addition  the need for continued investment in research and development  marketing and customer support limits the company s ability to reduce expenses in response to downturns in the industries it serves 
international business in fiscal  and   and  respectively  of the company s total revenue was attributable to sales outside the united states 
in addition  under certain circumstances  products sold to us customers are shipped to those customers overseas facilities 
the company expects that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of its total revenue 
sales to customers outside the united states are subject to numerous risks  including exposure to currency fluctuations  the imposition of government controls  the need to comply with a wide variety of foreign and us export laws  political and economic instability  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs and taxes typically associated with foreign sales  the greater difficulty of administering business overseas and general economic conditions 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect the company s intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
moreover  slurries marketed and distributed by both the company and the fujimi joint venture are purchased from fujimi incorporated  a japanese company 
the company also purchases in japanese yen certain equipment from the far east joint venture that the company then sells in the us and europe 
fluctuations in exchange rates have in the past resulted  and may in the future result  in increases in the cost to the company of such products 
also  because the value of the net assets of the company s foreign subsidiaries and its equity interest in the far east joint venture fluctuate based upon exchange rates and because the company does not hedge the value of such net assets  fluctuations in exchange rates may have an adverse effect on the company s stockholders equity 
the company anticipates that the recent turmoil in asian economies and the recent deterioration of the underlying economic conditions in certain asian countries will continue to have an impact on its sales  and the sales of its joint ventures  to customers located in or whose end user customers are located in those countries 
in addition  revenue and profits may continue to be impacted as a result of currency fluctuations on the relative price of the company s products  or the products of its joint ventures  and restrictions on government spending 
in addition  customers in those countries have faced reduced access to working capital to fund purchases of the company s products  or the products of its joint ventures  due to higher interest rates  reduced bank lending or the deterioration in the customer s or its bank s financial condition or the inability to access other financing which has negatively impacted sales to those customers 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results the company s quarterly operating results have historically and may in the future vary significantly due to a number of factors 
factors that may influence the company s operating results in a given quarter include i customer demand  such as economic conditions in the semiconductor  memory disk and silicon wafer industries  market acceptance of products of both the company and its customers  changes in product mix  and the timing  cancellation or delay of customer orders and shipments  ii competition  such as competitive pressures on prices of the company s products and the introduction or announcement of new products by competitors  iii manufacturing and operations  such as fluctuations in availability and cost of raw materials and production capacity  iv fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  v new product development  such as increased research  development and engineering  as well as marketing  expenses associated with new product introductions  including the effect of transitioning to new or enhanced products  and the company s ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis  vi sales and marketing  such as concentrations of customers  and discounts that may be granted to certain customers  and vii the quarterly operating results of the company s joint ventures  which the company accounts for on the equity method  as well as other factors  such as levels of expenses relative to revenue levels  personnel changes and generally prevailing economic conditions 
during a given quarter  a significant portion of the company s revenue may be derived from the sale of a relatively small number of machines and systems 
accordingly  a small change in the number of machines and systems actually shipped may cause significant changes in operating results 
moreover  customers may cancel or reschedule shipments  and production difficulties could delay shipments 
in addition  because of the significantly different gross margins attributable to the company s two segments  changes in product mix may cause fluctuations in operating results 
further  the lengthy sales cycle for certain of the company s capital equipment may result in the company incurring significant expenses prior to the receipt of customer orders 
in addition  the introduction of new products has in the past contributed  and may continue to contribute  to fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
these same factors also could materially and adversely affect annual results of operations 
in addition  the need for continued investment in research and development  marketing and customer support limits the company s ability to reduce expenses in response to downturns in the industries it serves 
intellectual property rights the company currently holds numerous united states patents and additional foreign patents in japan and several asian and european countries and has numerous united states and foreign patent applications pending 
in addition  the company believes that such factors as continued innovation  technical expertise and know how of its personnel and other factors are also important 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to protect its technology or that competitors will not be able to develop similar technology independently 
no assurance can be given that the claims allowed on any patents held or acquired by the company will be sufficiently broad to protect the company s technologies 
in addition  no assurance can be given that any existing or future patents issued to the company will not be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the company 
in that event  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected 
moreover  the company may choose to incur significant costs in an attempt to defend its patent rights 
in addition  although the company believes that its products do not infringe any valid existing proprietary rights of others  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims in the future 
in the cmp market the company serves  there are a number of patents relating to the cmp process held by third parties 
accordingly  the company  as a cmp equipment manufacturer  may be required to attempt to obtain licenses from the holders of one or more of such patents  which may impede the use of cmp technology by the company 
there also may be pending patent applications or issued patents of which the company is not aware  and which would require the company to license or challenge such patents  at significant expense to the company 
there can be no assurance that any such license would be available on acceptable terms  if at all  or that the company would prevail in any such challenge 
see business intellectual property 
possible volatility of stock price the stock price of the company may be subject to wide fluctuations and possible rapid increases or declines in a short time period 
these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to the company such as variations in quarterly operating results or changes in analysts earnings estimates  or to factors relating to the industries in which the company operates and sells or to the securities markets in general  which  in recent years  have experienced significant price fluctuations or to global economic events 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies whose stocks are traded 
sole or limited sources of supply the company relies to a substantial extent on outside suppliers to manufacture many of the components and subassemblies used in the company s capital equipment  some of which are obtained from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
the company s reliance on outside suppliers generally  and a sole or a limited group of suppliers in particular  involves several risks  including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components and reduced control over quality  pricing and timing of delivery of components 
in the past  the company has experienced delays in receiving materials from suppliers  sometimes resulting in delays in the delivery of products by the company 
such delays  or other significant supplier or supply quality issues  may occur in the future  which could result in a material adverse effect on the company 
because the manufacture of certain of these components and subassemblies is specialized and requires long lead times  there can be no assurance that delays or shortages caused by suppliers will not reoccur 
any inability to obtain adequate deliveries  or any other circumstance that would require the company to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture such components internally  could delay shipment of the company s products  increase its cost of goods sold and have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations
