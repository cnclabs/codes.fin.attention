the following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview the company operates the excite network and provides a gateway to the web that organizes  aggregates and delivers information to meet the needs of individual consumers 
excite  inc  formerly architext software  inc  was formed in june and  from its inception to september  its operating activities related primarily to recruiting personnel  raising capital  purchasing operating assets  providing custom product development and consulting services 
the company first launched its excite search and directory service in october in april  the company launched a channels based format for its service and content on the excite brand to provide consumers with an interface that reflects the way they navigate through other forms of media and enables advertisers to more effectively reach target consumers 
the excite brand currently includes channels of topical interest such as entertainment  sports and business investing 
in september  the company launched a similar channels based format for its webcrawler brand which currently includes topical channels 
historically  advertising revenues have been derived principally from short term advertising contracts in which the company guarantees a minimum number of impressions a view of an advertisement banner by a consumer for a fixed fee 
such banner advertising revenue is dependent upon both the number of impressions and the rate per thousand impressions cpms charged 
higher rates can be charged for advertisements focused on targeted groups  either by key word associations or affiliations with specific content  than for general rotation advertisements on the excite network 
in  the company began entering into longer term advertising and commerce sponsorship agreements 
these agreements generally involve more integration with the excite network and provide for more varied sources of revenue to excite over the term of the agreements  which average from two to three years 
under these agreements  excite earns fees for initial programming  initiation of service and access to the excite network  and for generating impressions which in some instances are guaranteed by the company 
a number of these agreements also provide that revenues or gross margins from advertising and electronic commerce transactions are to be shared between the advertiser and excite as realized 
revenues or margin sharing recognized from such electronic commerce transactions were insignificant in  and are expected to be insignificant in as well 
sponsorship customers accounted for approximately of advertising revenues in although the company does not anticipate revenue growth from sponsorship advertising to increase at the rate experienced in  the company believes that revenue relating to sponsorship advertising revenue will increase in absolute dollars in future periods 
revenues are generally recognized ratably over the term of the advertising agreement  provided that the company does not have any significant remaining obligations and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
to the extent that impression deliveries are falling short of the guarantees  the company defers recognition of the corresponding revenues 
see risk factors that may affect future results risks related to sponsorships and risks associated with banner advertising 
the company has incurred significant operating losses since inception 
as of december   the company had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
although the company has experienced significant revenue growth during and  there can be no assurance that this growth rate will be sustained  that revenues will continue to grow  or that historical operating results will be indicative of future operating results 
in addition  the company has increased  and plans to increase further  its operating expenses in order to increase its sales and marketing efforts  fund greater levels of research and development and increase its general and administrative costs to support a larger organization 
to the extent that revenues do not grow at anticipated rates or that increases in operating expenses precede or are not subsequently followed by commensurate increases in revenues  or that the company is unable to adjust operating expense levels accordingly  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
as a result of various asset acquisitions  operating results will be negatively affected by approximately million of amortization in  assuming no additional acquisitions and no significant adjustments to the economic lives of the underlying intangible assets 
the extent of the future losses will be contingent on a variety of factors  including  without limitation  the factors set forth under risk factors that may affect future results included in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

see risk factors that may affect future results acquisition strategy  integration of past and future acquisitions  and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
on november   the company acquired netbot  a seattle based internet software developer of advanced search technology 
the netbot merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
the company issued approximately  shares of the company s common stock to former stockholders of netbot and assumed options and warrants to purchase approximately  shares of the company s common stock 
financial information for dates and periods prior to the merger has not been restated to reflect the combined operations of the company and netbot as netbot s results of operations were not material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
on august   the company acquired the mckinley group  inc mckinley  the creator of the magellan on line guide 
the transaction was effected through the issuance of  shares of the company s common stock and was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
all financial information for dates and periods prior to the merger was restated to reflect the combined operations of the company and mckinley 
in march  the company completed its acquisition of the webcrawler search and directory technology the webcrawler acquisition from aol for an aggregate of  shares of the company s convertible preferred stock 
for accounting purposes  the company recorded the webcrawler acquisition as of december  the transaction was accounted for as an acquisition of rights to developed and purchased in process technology and distribution rights

results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of total revenues represented by certain items from the company s consolidated statement of operations 
the company believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results are not necessarily meaningful because of its limited operating history  the evolving nature of its business and its acquisitions 
results for were not comparable to and because the company did not begin selling advertising space on its network until october years ended december  revenues advertising revenues contract and other revenues total revenues cost of revenues hosting costs royalties and other cost of revenues amortization of purchased technology total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing distribution license fees general and administrative charge for purchased in process technology other merger and acquisition related costs  including amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles total operating expenses operating loss equity share of losses of affiliated company interest income expense and other net loss revenues the company began selling advertising space on its network in october prior to that date  contract and other revenues consisted primarily of revenues derived from custom product development  licensing of the mckinley database  royalties from sales of the mckinley internet yellow pages and consulting fees 
revenues increased from  for to million for  and to million for these increases were primarily the result of increases in the number of advertisements sold  increases in sales of targeted advertisements with higher rates  increases in the number of advertisers purchasing advertisements on the company s web sites and  in  an increase in sponsorship advertising revenue 
the company expects to continue to derive a substantial majority of its revenue from selling advertisements on its network 
because the market for advertising on the web is intensely competitive  advertising rates could be subject to pricing pressures in the future 
if the company is forced to reduce its advertising rates or experiences lower cpms as a result of such competition or otherwise  future revenues could be adversely affected 
two customers accounted for and  respectively  of total revenues for one customer accounted for approximately of total revenues for no customer accounted for more than of total revenues in revenues generated from international operations for were not significant 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
cost of revenues cost of revenues includes hosting costs  royalties and other cost of revenues  and amortization of purchased technology 
hosting costs relate to the maintenance and technical support of the excite network  which are comprised principally of personnel costs  telecommunications costs  equipment depreciation  and overhead allocations 
royalties and other cost of revenues include expenses related to royalties  license agreements and revenue sharing agreements for content and other services such as email and chat room services 
in and  the company recognized  as a component of total cost of revenues  amortization of purchased technology of  and million  respectively  related to the webcrawler acquisition 
as of december   this purchased technology has been fully amortized 
total cost of revenues increased by million from million  or of total revenues for  to million  or of total revenues for this increase was primarily the result of increased amortization expense  as well as increased hosting cost to support higher revenues and increased royalties and margin sharing obligations from distribution and content agreements that were entered into in cost of revenues for was not comparable to and as the nature of the company s revenues changed significantly with the launch of the company s services in october excluding amortization of purchased technology  cost of revenues increased in absolute dollars by million from million  or of total revenues for  to million  or of total revenues for this increase in absolute dollars was due primarily to increased personnel expenses and equipment costs relating to hosting the company s web sites and increased royalties and margin sharing costs 
excluding amortization  cost of revenues in future periods is expected to increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues as the company increases costs to support expanded services and content 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of total revenues was  and for  and  respectively 
the decline in the gross profit as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to the amortization of purchased technology discussed above  as well as increased hosting costs to support expanded web site offerings and increased royalties and margin sharing costs  offset in part by increased revenues 
excluding the amortization of purchased technology in and  gross profit as a percentage of total revenues was and  respectively 
the types of advertisements sold and revenue sharing provisions of distribution and content agreements have negatively affected gross profit in the past and may continue to negatively affect it in the future 
furthermore  pursuant to the provisions of certain agreements with operators of web access points and with content providers  the company shares advertising revenues based upon the number of consumers directed to its network 
a low level of targeted advertising as a percentage of total advertising sold  a decrease in targeted or mass web advertising rates or an increase in the company s revenue sharing obligations could adversely affect gross profit 
operating expenses the company s operating expenses have significantly increased in absolute dollars since inception 
this trend reflects the company s rapid transition from the research and development stage to marketing and offering its services 
the company believes that continued expansion of operations is essential to achieving and maintaining market leadership 
consequently  the company intends to continue to increase operating expenses in the foreseeable future 
the company also expects operating expenses to increase ratably as a result of the acquisition of netbot and matchlogic 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist principally of engineering and editorial personnel costs  allocation of overhead  equipment depreciation  consulting fees and supplies 
costs related to research  design and development of products have been charged to research and development expenses as incurred 
research and development expenses increased from million  or of total revenues for  to million  or of total revenues for  and to million  or of total revenues for the increase in absolute dollars in was primarily due to increased engineering and editorial staff required to develop and enhance the company s services as well as increased research and development activities resulting from the webcrawler acquisition and the merger with mckinley 
the increase in absolute dollars for was due to an increase in engineering headcount to support the company s channels format and personalization capabilities for the excite network 
the company believes that a significant level of research and development expenses is required to remain competitive and  accordingly  the company anticipates that it will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and that these costs will continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist principally of sales and marketing personnel costs  agency and consulting fees  commissions  promotional and advertising expenses and allocation of overhead 
sales and marketing expenses increased in absolute dollars from million  or of total revenues for  to million  or of total revenues for  and to million  or of total revenues for the increase was mainly due to the launch of a significant media advertising campaign during the fourth quarter of  and to increased sales personnel costs as a result of the transition from the use of outside advertising sales agencies for the sales of advertisements to a direct sales force 
the increase was primarily due to the continuation of the media campaign discussed above into the first quarter of  the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel and the launching of the webcrawler brand 
in order to promote its brands  the company may find it necessary in the future to increase its marketing budget or otherwise increase its financial commitment to creating and maintaining brand loyalty among customers 
the company expects to continue to incur significant promotional and advertising expenses and anticipates that these costs will increase in absolute dollars in future periods 
distribution license fees 
distribution license fees decreased from million for to million for there were no distribution license fees for in  distribution license fees included a one time  non cash charge of approximately million related to the issuance of a warrant to aol during the first quarter of  and a million charge relating to the company s premier provider agreements with netscape in the second quarter of in may  the company entered into a new agreement with netscape to continue the premier provider arrangement for the excite brand  and entered into a marquee provider agreement for the webcrawler brand 
under the terms of these agreements  the company is committed to make minimum payments of approximately million in exchange for a guaranteed number of impressions 
of the million minimum  a portion is being applied towards advertising by netscape on the excite network over the term of the agreements based upon delivery of such advertising  with the remainder being paid in cash at intervals over the term of the agreements 
the company is currently negotiating with netscape to renew these agreements before they expire on april  although the percentage of daily traffic directed from netscape declined significantly from approximately to less than over the course of  if the company were not able to enter into replacement agreements with netscape at the end of the term  the excite network could lose a significant amount of its traffic  and advertising revenue could be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that netscape will continue to offer these programs after april  even if the company is able to enter into replacement agreements with netscape  to the extent that any such replacement agreements are on materially worse terms than those of the company s current agreements  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in the future  high traffic web sites  internet service providers  providers of web browsers or other distribution channels could require cash payments or other types of consideration as compensation for listing or promoting the excite network  which could result in increased distribution license fees 
see risk factors that may affect future results dependence on third party relationships  uncertain renewal of netscape agreements 
in june  the company entered into a co marketing services agreement and a trademark license agreement with netscape 
under these agreements  the company is responsible for the programming  production  operations and advertising sales of international netscape guide by excite  a new service being made available in japan  germany  france  the united kingdom and australia 
in connection with these agreements  the company made a payment of million to netscape in july  which is being amortized over the terms of these agreements to distribution license fees expense 
general and administrative

general and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars from million  or of total revenues for  to million  or of total revenues for  and to million  or of total revenues for the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increased personnel  professional service fees  provision for doubtful accounts and  in  relocation to new facilities to support the company s growth

year implications many existing computer programs use only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
these programs  which were developed without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century  could fail or create erroneous results by or at the year the company has reviewed its internal programs  and has determined that there are no significant year issues within the company s systems or services 
however  the company cannot be certain that its customers  vendors or financial services providers will not have year issues

the company evaluates its foreign currency exchange rate exposure on an ongoing basis 
capital expenditures have been  and future expenditures are anticipated to be  primarily for facilities and equipment to support expansion of the company s operations and management information systems 
the company expects that its capital expenditures will increase as its employee base grows 
as of december   the company did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures  although the company anticipates that its planned purchases of capital equipment and leasehold improvements will require additional expenditures in  a substantial portion of which is expected to be financed through equipment leases 
at december   the company has million available on an equipment lease line  and believes that additional lease financing will be available to it if necessary 
the company believes the existing working capital balance together with cash flows generated from advertising revenues will be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures and business expansion for at least the remainder of thereafter  the company may need to raise additional funds 
the company may need to raise additional funds sooner in order to fund more rapid expansion  to develop new or enhanced services or products  to respond to competitive pressures or to acquire complementary products  businesses or technologies 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of the shareholders of the company will be reduced  shareholders may experience additional dilution and such securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of the company s common stock 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to the company  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  the company may not be able to fund its expansion  take advantage of unanticipated acquisition opportunities  develop or enhance services or products or respond to competitive pressures 
such inability could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
risk factors that may affect future results this report contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual revenues and results of operations could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth in the following risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
limited operating history  no assurance of profitability  certain forward looking statements 
the company was founded in june and generated only limited revenues prior to accordingly  the company has a limited operating history upon which an evaluation of the company and its current business can be based 
in addition  the company s business model is evolving and relies substantially upon the sale of advertising on the web 
the company s business must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and problems frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as the web and web based advertising 
specifically  such risks include  without limitation  the inability of the company to maintain premier positions on high traffic web access points or to maintain or enter into additional distribution relationships with internet service providers isps or online service providers osps  the inability of the company to maintain and increase levels of traffic on the excite network  the inability of the company to effectively integrate the technology and operations of acquired businesses or technologies with its operations  the inability of the company to expand its international operations  particularly in light of the company s limited operating experience in the international market  the failure by the company to continue to develop and extend the excite and webcrawler brands  the inability of the company to successfully integrate sponsored services or to meet minimum guaranteed impressions under sponsorship agreements  the inability of the company to develop or acquire content for its services  the failure of consumers to accept the company s personalized web services  such as my excite channel  email or chat room services  the inability of the company to generate commerce related revenues  the failure of the company to anticipate and adapt to a developing market  the introduction and development of equal or superior services or products by competitors  particularly in light of the fact that microsoft and netscape  operators of two of the most heavily trafficked web sites  have announced that they will be offering competitive services  the failure of the market to adopt the web as an advertising and commercial medium  reductions in market prices for web based advertising as a result of competition or otherwise  the inability of the company to achieve higher cost per thousand impressions cpm rates for targeted advertising or to increase the percentage of its advertising inventory sold  the inability of the company to identify  attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  and general economic conditions 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in addressing such risks  and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company has incurred significant operating losses since inception  and as of december   the company had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
although the company experienced significant revenue growth during  there can be no assurance that this growth rate will be sustained or that revenues will continue to grow or that historical operating results will be indicative of future operating results 
as the company has grown  its operating expenses have increased  and the company expects that its operating expenses will continue to increase as a result of its acquisitions and in connection with its sales and marketing efforts  its increased funding for development activities and the increased general and administrative staff needed to support the company s growth 
to the extent that revenues do not grow at anticipated rates or that increases in operating expenses precede or are not subsequently followed by commensurate increases in revenues  or that the company is unable to adjust operating expense levels accordingly  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that in the future the company will be profitable on a quarterly or annual basis 
certain executive officers of the company have made certain forward looking statements regarding the company s future prospects  which statements have been published in a variety of news articles 
these statements include statements regarding the company s prospects for revenues and profitability in the future  the amount of revenues that may be generated by matchlogic  which the company acquired in february  the rate at which the company s revenues will increase and the ability of the company to increase its advertising rates 
the occurrence or achievement of any of the events described in these statements is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 
in particular  risks and uncertainties relating to forward looking statements as to the company s revenues  profitability and advertising rates include  without limitation the need for continued increases in the number of companies advertising on the excite network as well as on the web generally  the company s ability to increase sales of targeted advertisements and advertisers willingness to pay higher cpm rates for advertisements on the excite network  the increasingly competitive environment for web advertising sales  the need for increases in the amount of traffic on the excite network  the increased amount of expenses and negative cash flows resulting from the company s acquisitions of netbot and matchlogic  the company s dependence on third parties to attract traffic to the excite network  the ability of the company to develop and achieve consumer and advertiser acceptance for the excite network in the international market  general economic conditions  and the risks relating to the acquisition of matchlogic described below 
see acquisition strategy  integration of past and future acquisitions  and developing market  dependence on continued growth in use of the web 
risks and uncertainties relating to forward looking statements regarding matchlogic s contribution to revenues and other operating results of excite in include without limitation risks involved in assimilating matchlogic while maintaining matchlogic as a separate operating unit  risks that matchlogic personnel  who are not subject to non competition agreements  will leave  risks inherent in matchlogic s business  including privacy concerns arising out of matchlogic s database marketing activities  which account for a majority of matchlogic s revenues  risks in the extremely limited operating history of matchlogic on which to base any revenue projections  the likely fluctuations in operating results of matchlogic due to factors beyond matchlogic s or excite s control  reliance by matchlogic on a limited number of customers for a substantial percentage of its projected revenues  the acceptance by matchlogic s advertising customers of matchlogic being owned by excite from which matchlogic purchases advertising  and the willingness by other web sites from which matchlogic purchases advertising particularly those which are direct competitors of excite to accept future advertising placements from matchlogic as a result of the acquisition by excite 
potential fluctuations in quarterly results  unpredictability of future revenues 
as a result of the company s limited operating history  the evolving nature of its business and its acquisitions  the company has limited meaningful historical financial data upon which to base planned operating expenses 
accordingly  the company s expense levels are based in part on its expectations as to future advertising revenues and to a large extent are fixed 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to accurately predict the levels of future advertising revenues  particularly in light of the intense competition for the sale of web based advertisements  the company s limited operating history and the uncertainty as to the viability of the web as an advertising medium 
the failure by the company to accurately make such predictions would have a materially adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the company derives a significant portion of its revenues from the sale of advertising under short term advertising contracts 
the cancellation or deferral of existing advertising contracts or the failure to obtain new advertising contracts in any quarter could materially and adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition for that quarter 
furthermore  the company derives advertising revenue based on the amount of traffic  or page views  on the excite network 
accordingly  any significant shortfall of traffic on the excite network in relation to the company s expectations or the expectations of existing or potential advertisers  would have an immediate material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
see risks associated with banner advertising 
the company s operating results have varied on a quarterly basis during its limited operating history and the company expects to experience significant fluctuations in future quarterly operating results 
such fluctuations have been and may in the future be caused by numerous factors  many of which are outside the company s control  including specific economic conditions relating to the internet and the web  usage of the web  demand for advertising on the excite network as well as demand for web based advertising in general  changes in advertising rates as a result of competition or otherwise  seasonal trends in advertising sales  the advertising budgeting cycles of advertisers  incurrence of charges in connection with  or the modification or expiration of  the company s distribution relationships with netscape  aol and other isps and osps or other third parties  demand for the company s services  incurrence of costs relating to acquisitions of businesses or technologies  introduction or enhancement of services by the company and its competitors  market acceptance of new services  delays in the introduction of services or enhancements by the company or its competitors  mix of types of advertisements sold  such as the amount of targeted advertising sold as a percentage of total advertising sold  capacity constraints and dependencies on computer infrastructure  and general economic conditions 
during its limited operating history  the company has experienced seasonal fluctuations in the amount of banner advertisements purchased on its network  with advertisers historically purchasing fewer advertisements in the first calendar quarter of each year 
because the market for web advertising is an emerging market  additional seasonal patterns in web advertising may develop in the future as the market matures 
due to all of the foregoing factors  the company s quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast 
the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations will not necessarily be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
also  it is likely that in some future quarter or quarters the company s operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would be materially and adversely affected 
acquisition strategy  integration of past and future acquisitions 
the company has in the past and may in the future acquire businesses  technologies  services  product lines  content databases  or access to content databases that are complementary to the company s business 
for example  the company acquired matchlogic in february  netbot in november  the assets relating to the webcrawler service in march and mckinley in august acquisitions involve a number of special risks  including  among other things  the difficulty of assimilating the technologies  operations and personnel of acquired companies with those of the company  the potential disruption of the company s business  the diversion of resources  the incurrence of acquisition related expenses  the write off or amortization of intangible assets  the assumption of unknown liabilities  the inability to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies and the impairment of relationships with employees and strategic partners as a result of such acquisitions or the integration of new personnel 
for example  the assimilation of prior acquisitions required  among other things  the integration of service offerings  coordination of the research and development and sales and marketing efforts  the assumption by the company of liabilities under distribution agreements and loan agreements  and the addition of a significant number of additional personnel 
the company could face similar integration issues with respect to certain of its recent or future acquisitions  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in addressing these risks 
any failure to successfully address these acquisition related risks could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
risks related to sponsorships 
the company has recently entered into sponsorship arrangements with third parties to provide sponsored services and placements on the excite network in addition to traditional banner advertising 
in connection with these arrangements  the company may receive sponsorship fees as well as a portion of transaction revenues received by such third party sponsors from users originated through the excite network  in return for minimum levels of user impressions to be provided by the company 
to the extent implemented  these arrangements expose the company to potentially significant financial risks  including the risk that the company fails to deliver required minimum levels of user impressions in which case  these agreements are typically subject to termination and that third party sponsors do not renew the agreements at the end of their term 
these arrangements also require the company to integrate sponsors content with the company s services  which requires the dedication of resources and significant programming and design efforts to accomplish 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract additional sponsors or that it will be able to renew existing sponsorship arrangements when they expire 
in addition  the company has granted exclusivity provisions to certain of its sponsors  and may in the future grant additional exclusivity provisions 
such exclusivity provisions may have the effect of preventing the company  for the duration of such exclusivity arrangements  from accepting advertising or sponsorship arrangements within a particular subject matter with respect to portions of a channel  an entire channel  across an entire service or over the whole excite network 
the inability of the company to enter into further sponsorship or advertising arrangements as a result of its exclusivity arrangements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
risks associated with banner advertising 
the company derives substantially all of its revenues from the sale of advertising  including banner advertisements and sponsorship arrangements  on the excite network 
a majority of the company s customers purchasing banner advertisements purchase these advertisements on a short term basis  and many of these customers may terminate their advertising commitments at any time without penalty 
consequently  there can be no assurance that these customers will continue or increase their level of advertising on the excite network or that these customers will not move their advertising to competing web sites or to other traditional media 
therefore  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in maintaining or increasing the amount of advertising on the excite network  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition

developing market  dependence on continued growth in use of the web 
the market for the company s services has recently begun to develop  is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an increasing number of market entrants who have introduced or developed services and products for use on the web or who seek to derive significant revenues from the sale of advertisements on the web 
the company is highly dependent upon the increased use of the web for information  publication  distribution and commerce  and there can be no assurance that the use of the web for these purposes will continue to grow at its current rate or at all 
the growth of the use of the web may be inhibited for a number of reasons  including  but not limited to  potentially inadequate development of network infrastructure  security concerns  inconsistent quality of service and lack of availability of cost effective  high speed service 
to the extent that use of the web does continue to grow  there can be no assurance that the internet infrastructure will continue to support the demands placed on it by such continued growth or that the performance or reliability of the internet will not be adversely affected 
in addition  the web as an advertising medium has not been available for a sufficient period of time to gauge its effectiveness as compared with traditional advertising media  and therefore the web is an unproven medium for advertising supported services 
accordingly  the company s future operating results will depend substantially upon the increased use of the web for information  publication  distribution and commerce and the emergence of the web as an effective advertising medium 
the company s ability to generate significant advertising revenues will also depend on  among other things  the development of a large base of users of the company s services possessing demographic characteristics attractive to advertisers  the ability of the company to accurately measure its user base and the ability of the company to develop or acquire effective advertising delivery and measurement systems 
many of the company s advertisers have only limited experience with the web as an advertising medium  have not yet devoted a significant portion of their advertising expenditures to web based advertising  and may not find such advertising to be effective for promoting their products and services relative to traditional print and broadcast media 
the adoption of web advertising  particularly by those entities that have historically relied upon traditional media for advertising  requires the acceptance of a new way of conducting business and exchanging information 
entities that already have invested substantial resources in other methods of conducting business may be reluctant to adopt a new strategy that may limit or compete with their existing efforts 
there can be no assurance that the market for web advertising will continue to emerge or become sustainable 
if the market fails to develop or develops more slowly than expected  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
no standards have been widely accepted for the measurement of the effectiveness of web based advertising  and there can be no assurance that such standards will develop sufficiently to support the web as an effective advertising medium 
there can be no assurance that advertisers will continue to accept the company s or other third party measurements of impressions  or that such measurements will not contain errors 
in such event  the company s advertising revenues could be materially and adversely affected  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  there is intense competition in the sale of advertising on the web  resulting in a wide range of rates quoted and a variety of pricing models offered by different vendors for a variety of advertising services  which makes it difficult to project future levels of advertising revenues and rates 
it is also difficult to predict which pricing models will be adopted by the industry or advertisers 
for example  advertising rates based on the number of click throughs  or user requests for additional information made by clicking on the advertisement from the company s network to the advertiser s web pages  instead of rates based solely on the number of impressions  would materially and adversely affect the company s revenues 
as a result of these risks  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in generating significant future advertising revenues from web based advertising  and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
see business competition 
further  there can be no assurance that advertisers will determine that banner advertising  the delivery of which currently comprises a substantial portion of the company s revenues  is an effective or attractive advertising medium  and there can be no assurance that the company will effectively transition to any other forms of web advertising should they develop and achieve market acceptance 
moreover  filter software programs that limit or prevent advertising from being delivered to a web user s computer are available 
widespread adoption of such software by users could have a material adverse effect upon the commercial viability of web advertising  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition

dependence on third party relationships  uncertain renewal of netscape agreements 
the company is currently  and will be in the future  dependent on a number of third party relationships for user traffic and to provide content on the excite network and to make it more attractive to advertisers and consumers 
these relationships include arrangements relating to the positioning of the excite network on web browsers such as those offered by netscape and microsoft  agreements with isps and osps such as aol and microsoft and arrangements for providing content for the excite network such as stock quotes and news stories 
for example  the company s excite brand is featured as one of four premier providers and the webcrawler brand is featured as one of several marquee providers on netscape s web site 
the termination of  or the failure of the company to renew on reasonable terms  its position on a web browser or its relationship with an isp  osp or key content provider could significantly reduce traffic on the excite network or could otherwise adversely affect the company s advertising revenues  which would also have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company could also incur expenses relating to distribution license fees as a result of a new agreement with a third party  including netscape 
these distribution license fees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company s agreements with netscape expire on april  while the company is currently negotiating with netscape regarding new agreements  netscape has expressed its intention to limit the number of companies that will be listed as premier providers or marquee providers on its web site  and there can be no assurance that the company will be selected as one of those companies 
furthermore  netscape has recently announced its intention to launch its own portal web site  which will offer services which are similar to those currently offered by the company  which services are expected to compete with the company s services 
even if netscape elects to continue to feature one or more third party providers of navigation services  it could select one of the company s competitors as an exclusive provider 
if the company were unable to renew its agreements with netscape  if netscape were to offer a competitive web gateway site or if netscape were to enter into an exclusive arrangement with one of the company s competitors  the excite network could lose a portion of its traffic  traffic on competing services could substantially increase or the excite network could otherwise become less attractive to advertisers  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  if any replacement agreements with netscape are on materially worse terms than those of the company s current premier provider agreement or marquee provider agreement  there would be a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company is also generally dependent on other web site operators that provide links to the excite network 
most of these arrangements do not require future minimum commitments to use the company s services to provide access or links to the excite network or to provide content to the company  are often not exclusive and are often short term or may be terminated at the convenience of the other party 
there can be no assurance that these third parties regard their relationship with the company as important to their own respective businesses and operations  that they will not reassess their commitment to the excite network at any time in the future  or that they will not develop their own competitive services or products 
further  there can be no assurance that the services of those companies that provide access to the excite network will achieve market acceptance or commercial success and therefore there can be no assurance that any significant amount of traffic will be directed to the excite network as a result of these third party relationships 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company s existing relationships will result in sustained business partnerships  successful service offerings  the generation of significant traffic on the excite network or significant revenues for the company 
the company also has a five year distribution agreement with aol which expires in november under which a co branded version of the excite search and directory service is designated as the exclusive web search and directory service for the aol service for an initial two year period ending in november if the exclusivity period is not extended by aol  the co branded service would become the default search and directory service of aol 
however  aol could enter into a strategic relationship with a competitor of the company or offer its own competing services  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition

management of growth 
the company s rapid growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on the company s managerial  operational and financial resources 
as of february   the company had grown to employees from employees at february  further  as the number of the company s users  advertisers and other business partners has grown  the company has been required to manage multiple relationships with various customers  strategic partners and other third parties 
these requirements will be exacerbated in the event of further growth in the company or in the number of its strategic relationships or sponsorship arrangements 
there can be no assurance that the company s systems  procedures or controls will be adequate to support the company s operations or that company management will be able to achieve the rapid execution necessary to successfully offer its services and implement its business plan 
the company s future operating results will also depend on its ability to expand its sales and marketing organization and expand its support organization commensurate with the growth of its business and the web 
if the company is unable to manage growth effectively  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected

risks associated with international operations 
a key component of the company s strategy is to expand its international operations and its international sales and marketing activities by offering localized versions of the excite network through joint venture arrangements or other strategic agreements 
expansion into these markets has required and will continue to require management attention and resources and may require the company to localize its services for a particular market 
the company has limited experience in localizing its services and many of the company s competitors are also undertaking to expand into foreign markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in expanding into international markets 
in addition to the uncertainty regarding the company s ability to generate revenues from foreign operations and expand its international presence  there are certain risks inherent in doing business on an international basis  including  among others  regulatory requirements  legal uncertainty regarding liability  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  different accounting practices  problems in collecting accounts receivable  political instability  seasonal reductions in business activity and potentially adverse tax consequences  any of which could adversely affect the success of the company s international operations 
to the extent the company expands its international operations and has additional portions of its international revenues denominated in foreign currencies  the company could become subject to increased risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
there can be no assurance that one or more of the factors discussed above will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future international operations and  consequently  on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition

risk of capacity constraints  system failures 
the company is dependent on its ability to generate a high volume of traffic to the excite network 
accordingly  the performance of the excite network is critical to the company s reputation  its ability to attract advertisers and to achieve market acceptance of the network 
any system failure that causes interruptions in the availability of or that increases response time of the company s services could reduce user satisfaction and traffic to the excite network and  if sustained or repeated  would reduce the attractiveness of the excite network to advertisers and consumers 
an increase in the volume of searches conducted through the excite network could strain the capacity of the software or hardware deployed by the company  which could lead to slower response time or system failures 
in addition  as the amount of web pages and traffic increases  there can be no assurance that the excite network will be able to scale proportionately 
the company is also dependent upon web browsers  isps  osps and other web site operators  which have experienced significant outages in the past  for access to its network  and web consumers have experienced outages  delays and other difficulties due to system failures unrelated to the company s systems and services 
additional difficulties could also materially and adversely affect consumer and advertiser satisfaction 
to the extent that the capacity constraints described above are not effectively addressed by the company  such constraints would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
substantially all of the company s communications hardware and certain of its computer hardware operations are located at leased facilities in redwood city  california  an area susceptible to earthquakes 
the company has experienced system failures or outages from time to time in the past  which have disrupted the operation of the excite network 
there can be no assurance that a system failure at this location would not adversely affect the performance of the excite network 
these systems are also vulnerable to damage from fire  floods  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events 
the company does not presently have a formal disaster recovery plan 
although the company carries property and business interruption insurance  its low coverage limits may not be adequate to compensate the company for all losses that may occur 
the company s servers are also vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptive problems 
computer viruses  break ins or other problems caused by third parties could lead to interruptions  delays or cessations in service to users of the excite network 
the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition

government regulation and legal uncertainties 
the company is not currently subject to direct regulation by any government agency  other than regulations applicable to businesses generally  and there are currently few laws or regulations directly applicable to access to or commerce on the web 
however  due to the increasing popularity and use of the web  it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the web  covering issues such as user privacy  pricing  characteristics and quality of products and services 
for example  although it was held unconstitutional  the telecommunications act of prohibited the transmission over the internet of certain types of information and content and other nations  including germany  have taken actions to restrict the free flow of material deemed to be objectionable on the web 
in addition  several telecommunications carriers are seeking to have telecommunications over the web regulated by the federal communications commission the fcc in the same manner as other telecommunications services 
in addition  because the growing popularity and use of the web has burdened the existing telecommunications infrastructure and many areas with high web use have begun to experience interruptions in phone service  local telephone carriers  such as pacific bell  have petitioned the fcc to regulate isps and osps in a manner similar to long distance telephone carriers and to impose access fees on the isps and osps 
if either of these petitions is granted  or the relief sought therein is otherwise granted  the costs of communicating on the web could increase substantially  potentially slowing the growth in use of the web  which could in turn decrease the demand for the company s services 
the adoption of any additional laws or regulations may also decrease the growth of the web  which could in turn decrease the demand for the excite network or could increase the company s cost of doing business 
moreover  the applicability to the web of existing laws in various jurisdictions governing issues such as property ownership  libel and personal privacy is uncertain and will take years to resolve 
any such new legislation or regulation or application or interpretation of existing laws could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
due to the global nature of the web  it is possible that  although transmissions of the excite network originate in the state of california  the governments of other states and foreign countries might attempt to regulate the company s transmissions or prosecute the company for violations of their laws 
there can be no assurance that violations of local laws will not be alleged or charged by state or foreign governments  that the company might not unintentionally violate such law or that such laws will not be modified  or new laws enacted  in the future 
it is also possible that states or foreign countries may seek to impose sales taxes on out of state companies that engage in commerce over the internet 
in the event that states or foreign countries succeed in imposing sales or other taxes on internet commerce  the growth of the use of the internet for commerce could slow substantially 
any of the foregoing developments could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition
