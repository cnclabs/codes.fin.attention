item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition impact of acquisitions  joint ventures and divestitures during fiscal  the company acquired two hospitals and affiliated health care entities and sold its remaining interest in a nebraska hospital 
in addition  the company entered into two joint ventures 
the company and universal health services  inc uhs formed valley health system llc and summerlin hospital medical center llc  both located in las vegas 
the company and columbia hca healthcare corp 
formed macon healthcare llc 
the company has equity interests of in valley health system llc  in summerlin hospital medical center llc and in macon healthcare llc 
these joint ventures own and operate seven hospitals 
the company accounts for its investments in the llcs using the equity method of accounting  and accordingly  the company s net investment is included in investment in unconsolidated entities and the company s share of the las vegas and macon earnings is included as equity in earnings of affiliates 
the company recorded a million charge after taxes related to the write down of goodwill at its hospital contributed to valley health system llc 
during fiscal  the company acquired five hospitals and affiliated health care entities and sold a minority interest in a hospital 
during fiscal  the company acquired two hospitals and affiliated health care entities and sold one hospital and a minority interest in a hospital 
the company regularly evaluates the performance of each of its owned hospitals in light of its business strategies 
the company is always looking for ways that its hospitals can better contribute to health care delivery in their communities while improving shareholder value 
because of the financial impact of the acquisitions  joint ventures and divestitures  it is difficult to make meaningful comparisons between the company s financial statements for the fiscal years presented 
in addition  due to the current number of owned hospitals  each additional hospital acquisition can affect the overall operating margin of the company 
during a transition period after the acquisition of a hospital  the company has typically taken a number of steps to lower operating costs 
the impact of such actions can be partially offset by cost increases to expand the hospital s services  strengthen its medical staff and improve its market position 
the benefits of these investments and of other activities to improve operating margins may not occur immediately 
consequently  the financial performance of an acquired hospital may adversely affect overall operating margins in the near term 
acquired facilities must show improved operating results more quickly than in the past for the company to achieve its growth targets

the company has included ebitda data because such data is used by certain investors to measure a company s ability to service debt

fiscal compared to fiscal the company s net operating revenue was  million in fiscal  compared to  million in fiscal  an increase of million or 
this increase was attributable to  among other things  six hospital acquisitions during fiscal and  a increase in revenue generated by hospitals owned during both periods calculated by comparing the same periods in both fiscal periods for hospitals owned for one year or more  and a increase in management services revenue 
the increase in revenue generated by hospitals owned during both periods is due to higher volumes  prices and additional revenue from final settlements with third party payors  partially offset by increased managed care and charity care discounts and the effects of the balanced budget act of the budget act 
the company s net operating revenue increases were partially offset by a reduction in net revenue due to the divestiture of the nebraska hospital and the contribution of hospitals to joint ventures  which were accounted for by the equity method

the provision for income taxes as a percent of net operating revenue decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal primarily attributable to a lower effective tax rate and a relative change in pretax income 
income before extraordinary item as a percent of net operating revenue was in fiscal compared to in fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to the fiscal acquisitions and was partially offset by the increased profitability of the company s hospitals owned during both periods  as discussed above 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company incurred extraordinary charges of million net of applicable income taxes of million 
the charges consist of the premium associated with the purchase of the senior subordinated notes  transaction costs  the write off of unamortized loan costs of the notes and the write off of unamortized loan costs of the million secured revolving credit facility

the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at june  and june  the company s cash requirements excluding acquisitions have historically been funded by cash generated from operations 
cash generated from operations was million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the decrease is primarily due to an increase in current year tax payments  payments related to the irs examinations and accounts receivable 
the increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to medicare intermediary computer system conversions  the patient accounting computer system conversion at one hospital and slower collections  which the company is addressing 
the increase is primarily due to the fiscal and acquisitions 
the complexity of the medicare and medicaid regulations  increases in managed care  hospital personnel turnover  including business office managers  dependence of hospitals on physician documentation of medical records and the subjective judgment involved complicates billing and collections of accounts receivable by hospitals 
there can be no assurance that this complexity will not negatively impact the company s future cash flow or results of operations 
capital expenditures excluding acquisitions for the years ended june   and  were million  million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures may vary from year to year depending on facility improvements and service enhancements undertaken by the owned hospitals

the company may prepay the amount outstanding at any time 
the interest rate in effect at june  was 
at june   the company had million outstanding under its revolving line of credit 
during fiscal  the company entered into a five year million ellf agreement to provide a financing option for future acquisitions and or construction 
this financing option is in addition to the company s million revolving line of credit 
the ellf interest rate margins and facility fee rates are substantially the same as the revolving line of credit

stock options are generally granted at an exercise price equal to the fair market value at the date of grant and are exercisable over a period not to exceed ten years 
the number of shares initially reserved for issuance was  no further options will be granted pursuant to the company s previous stock option plan 
in fiscal  the company adopted a stockholder rights plan and declared a dividend of one right for each share of common stock held as of the close of business on april  each right entitles stockholders to acquire one third of a share of common stock at an exercise price of  subject to adjustment

in the event the company is involved in a merger or other business combination transaction with another person or sells percent or more of its assets or earning power to another person  each right will entitle its holder to purchase a number of shares of the company s common stock or the acquiring company s common stock having a market value of two times the then current exercise price of the right 
the rights may be redeemed at 
per right at any time until the tenth day following public announcement that a position has been acquired 
the rights expire on april market risks associated with financial instruments the company s interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in us interest rates  the company generally maintains of its debt as fixed rate in nature either by borrowing on a long term basis or entering into interest rate swap transactions 
the interest rate swap agreements are contracts to periodically exchange fixed and floating interest rate payments over the life of the agreements 
the floating rate payments are based on libor and fixed rate payments are dependent upon market levels at the time the swap agreement was consummated 
the interest rate swap agreements do not constitute positions independent of the underlying exposures 
the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to any instruments with leverage features 
certain swap agreements allow the counterparty a one time option at the end of the initial term to cancel the agreement or a one time option at the end of the initial term to extend the swaps for an incremental five years 
the company is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to its financial instruments 
the counterparties are creditworthy financial institutions and the company anticipates that the counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts 
for the years ended june   and  the company received a weighted average rate of in each year and paid a weighted average rate on its interest rate swap agreements of  and  respectively 
the table below presents information about the company s market sensitive financial instruments  including long term debt and interest rate swaps as of june  for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for interest rate swap agreements  the table presents notional amounts by expected maturity date assuming the options to extend are not exercised and weighted average interest rates based on rates in effect at june  the fair values of long term debt and interest rate swaps were determined based on quoted market prices at june  for the same or similar debt issues

these programs are present in software applications running on desktop computers and network servers 
these programs are also present in microchips and microcontrollers incorporated into equipment 
certain of the company s computer hardware and software  building infrastructure components eg alarm systems and hvac systems and medical devices that are date sensitive  may contain programs with the year problem 
if uncorrected  the problem could result in computer system and program failures or equipment and medical device malfunctions that could result in a disruption of business operations or affect patient diagnosis and treatment 
the company has a year strategy for its owned hospitals that includes phases for education  inventory and assessment of applications and equipment at risk  analysis and planning  testing  conversion remediation replacement and post implementation 
the company s strategy also includes development of contingency plans to address potential disruption of operations arising from the year problem 
the company has developed educational materials to inform the owners of the hospitals it manages about the year problem 
the company intends to monitor the progress of the response by the hospitals it manages to the year problem 
the company does not believe that it is responsible for ensuring year compliance by its managed hospitals 
the company can provide no assurance  however  that its managed hospitals will not seek to hold it responsible for losses they incur arising out of the year problem 
nor can the company provide assurance that it will not ultimately be found liable for such losses  if they occur 
the company has completed an initial assessment of financial application software used in its owned hospitals in such areas as patient accounting and financial reporting 
three owned hospitals are scheduled to convert to year compliant financial software systems by summer the company is in the process of evaluating financial software alternatives for resolution of the year problem for one hospital 
upgrades have been scheduled for the remaining hospitals for financial application software which is not year compliant 
with respect to other software and computer equipment  such as patient care and ancillary software  some hospitals are still evaluating the year problem 
others have begun upgrading or replacing such software and equipment 
the company expects this evaluation to be completed in fall and intends for critical remediation to be substantially completed by summer the company s corporate office and management services business are scheduled to convert to compliant financial software applications by june the company believes that the corporate office network is year compliant 
other management services and corporate office computer software and equipment are currently being tested 
the company is in the inventory and assessment phase of its analysis of other owned hospital systems such as biomedical equipment and building infrastructure components 
the company anticipates completing this phase by december because the company has not completed the inventory and assessment phase  it is unable to establish an estimated date for completing subsequent phases with respect to equipment and infrastructure in its owned hospitals 
the company believes that year related remediation costs incurred through fiscal have not been material to its results of operations 
the company is not able to reasonably estimate the total costs to be incurred for completion of its year strategy at this time 
some replacements and upgrades would take place in the normal course of business 
the company relies heavily on third parties in operating its business 
in addition to its reliance on software  hardware and other equipment vendors to verify year compliance of their products  the company also depends on i fiscal intermediaries which process claims and make payments for the medicare program  ii insurance companies  hmo s and other private payors  iii utilities which provide electricity  water  natural gas and telephone services and iv vendors of medical supplies and pharmaceuticals used in patient care 
as a part of its year strategy  the company intends to seek assurances from these parties that their services and products will not be interrupted or malfunction due to the year problem 
failure of these third parties to resolve their year issues could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and ability to provide health care services 
the company intends to complete its initial contingency plan by june however  in some instances eg loss of water supply  the company may not be able to develop contingency plans which allow the affected hospital to continue to operate 
each of the company s owned hospitals has a disaster plan which will be reviewed as a part of the company s contingency planning process 
the foregoing assessment is based on information currently available to the company 
the company will revise its assessment as it implements its year strategy 
the company can provide no assurances that applications and equipment the company believes to be year compliant will not experience difficulties or that the company will not experience difficulties obtaining resources needed to make modifications to or replace the company s affected systems and equipment 
failure by the company or third parties on which it relies to resolve year issues could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and its ability to provide health care services 
consequently  the company can give no assurances that issues related to year will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
general the federal medicare program and state medicaid programs accounted for approximately  and of gross patient service revenue for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the payment rates under the medicare program for inpatients are prospective  based upon the diagnosis of a patient 
under the budget act  there are no increases in the inpatient operating payment rates to acute care hospitals for services through september  and subsequent increases are expected to be less than inflation 
the budget act reduced inpatient capital payments in the aggregate by effective october  payments for medicare outpatient services  home health services and skilled nursing facility services historically have been paid based on costs  subject to certain adjustments and limits 
the budget act requires that the payment for those services be converted to prospective payment systems pps  which are scheduled to be phased in over various periods  beginning july  the company expects a reduction in payments for outpatient and home health in the interim period prior to implementation of pps and skilled nursing facility services under pps 
the budget act is expected to reduce the company s ability to maintain its current rate of net revenue growth and operating margins 
the budget act and further changes in the medicare or medicaid programs and other proposals to limit health care spending could have a material adverse impact upon the health care industry and the company 
the company expects continuing pressure to limit expenditures by governmental health care programs 
the company is continuing to experience an increase in managed care 
an increasing number of payors are actively negotiating amounts paid to hospitals  which are typically lower than their standard rates 
additionally  some managed care payors pay less than the negotiated rate which  if undetected  results in lower net revenues 
the trend toward managed care  including health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations and various other forms of managed care  may adversely affect the company s ability to maintain its current rate of net revenue growth and operating margins 
the company s acute care hospitals  like most acute care hospitals in the united states  have significant unused capacity 
the result is substantial competition for patients and physicians 
inpatient utilization continues to be negatively affected by payor required pre admission authorization and by payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients 
the company expects increased competition and admission constraints to continue in the future 
the ability to successfully respond to these trends  as well as spending reductions in governmental health care programs  will play a significant role in determining hospitals ability to maintain their current rate of net revenue growth and operating margins 
the company expects the industry trend from inpatient to outpatient services to continue due to the increased focus on managed care and advances in technology 
outpatient revenue of the company s owned hospitals was approximately  and of gross patient service revenue for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the company s historical financial trend has been favorably impacted by the company s ability to successfully acquire acute care hospitals 
the company believes that trends in the health care industry described above may create possible future acquisition opportunities 
the company faces competition in acquiring hospitals from a number of well capitalized organizations 
many states have implemented new review processes by the attorneys general of not for profit hospital acquisitions  resulting in delays to close an acquisition 
additionally  some hospitals are sold through an auction process  which may result in higher purchase prices being paid by competitors for those properties than the company believes are reasonable 
the year problem may reduce the number of suitable hospital acquisition candidates 
as the company grows  it depends on a greater volume of acquisitions  or acquisitions of a larger size  to achieve its growth targets 
there can be no assurances that the company can continue to maintain its current growth rate through hospital acquisitions and the successful integration of hospitals into its system 
the company s owned hospitals accounted for of the company s net operating revenue in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal in fiscal  the dothan  alabama and fort wayne  indiana markets accounted for approximately of the company s owned hospital revenue and of the company s owned hospital ebitda 
due to the current number of owned hospitals  changes in any individual market can affect the overall operating results of the company 
furthermore  concentration of results of operations in the dothan  alabama and fort wayne  indiana markets increases the risks that adverse developments at these facilities will have a material adverse effect on the company s operations or financial condition 
in addition  the amounts expected to be derived from the fort wayne  indiana market will increase as a result of the acquisition of st 
joseph medical center 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in its financial statements 
resolution of matters  for example  final settlements with third party payors  may result in changes from those estimates 
the timing and amount of such changes in estimates may cause fluctuations in the company s quarterly or annual operating results 
the federal government and a number of states are rapidly increasing the resources devoted to investigating allegations of fraud and abuse in the medicare and medicaid programs 
at the same time  regulatory and law enforcement authorities are taking an increasingly strict view of the requirements imposed on providers by the social security act and medicare and medicaid regulations 
although the company believes that it is in material compliance with such laws  a determination that the company has violated such laws  or even the public announcement that the company was being investigated concerning possible violations  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the irs is in the process of conducting examinations of the company s federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended june  through the company has reached a settlement with the irs in connection with its examination of the company s federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended june  through the settlement did not have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
in june  the oig requested information from the company in connection with an investigation involving the company s procedures for preparing medicare cost reports 
in january  the us department of justice issued a civil investigative demand which also requested information from the company in connection with that same investigation 
as a part of the government s investigation  several former and current employees of the company were interviewed 
the company cooperated fully with the investigation 
the company received no communication from the government on this matter from approximately june until august in august  the government informed the company that the investigation was prompted by allegations made by a former employee of a hospital managed by a company subsidiary 
the allegations concern the preparation of cost reports for medicare and other government payment programs for owned and managed hospitals 
at a meeting to discuss the case  held september   the company learned that the government would likely commence litigation under the false claims act on or about october  the company intends to continue to cooperate with the government s inquiry  and  if appropriate  will try to reach a settlement of this case 
on may   the company learned that it is a named defendant in a separate qui tam case when it received a letter from a us attorney 
the complaint alleges violations of medicare laws governing the home health operations at two of the company s hospitals 
the complaint was filed under seal in june by a former employee who was discharged by the company in april the purpose of the letter from the us attorney was to allow the company an opportunity to evaluate the results of the government s investigation to date and to discuss with the government the allegations made in the complaint  prior to the government making a decision as to whether it will intervene as a plaintiff in the case 
the lawsuit remains under seal for all other purposes 
the company intends to cooperate fully and share information with the us attorney s office 
if any violation of law is found  the company intends to pursue an amicable settlement 
the case is in a very preliminary stage 
the company cannot at this time predict the outcome of these cases or their ultimate impact on the company s business or operating results 
if the outcome of either case were unfavorable  the company could be subject to fines  penalties and damages and also could be excluded from medicare and other government reimbursement programs 
these and other results of these cases could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations

in addition  suppliers pass along rising costs to the company in the form of higher prices

the company cannot predict its ability to offset or control future cost increases
