item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 
the company seeks to minimize the risks from these interest rates and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through its regular operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and is not a party to any leveraged financial instruments 
a discussion of the company s accounting policies for financial instruments is included in note summary of significant accounting policies of notes to financial statements at page of the company s annual report to shareowners  and such information is incorporated herein by reference 
additional disclosure relating to financial instruments is included in note financial instruments of notes to financial statements at pages and of the company s annual report to shareowners  and such information is incorporated herein by reference 
the company uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge the exposure to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s principal currency exposures relate to the french franc  the german deutsche mark and the british pound against the us dollar 
the company s exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from intercompany loans utilized to finance foreign subsidiaries  receivables  payables and firm commitments arising from international transactions 
the company attempts to have all such transaction exposures hedged with internal natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and  once these opportunities have been exhausted  through derivative financial instruments with third parties using forward or option agreements 
the company also uses derivative financial instruments to hedge the company s exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates for the translated us dollar value of net income of a number of foreign subsidiaries 
forward and option agreements used to hedge net income are marked to market and recognized immediately in income 
the company utilizes both fixed rate and variable rate debt as described in note long term debt and credit agreement of notes to financial statements at page of the company s annual report to shareowners  and such information is incorporated herein by reference 
the company uses interest rate swaps to manage the company s exposure to interest rate movements and reduce borrowing costs 
the company also maintains debt investments classified as available for sale and carried at their quoted market value 
these short term investments result from excess cash on hand 
the company manages market risk by restricting the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities and by limiting potential interest and currency rate exposures to amounts that are not material to the company s consolidated results of operations and cash flows 
the company also has procedures to monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value of its long term debt  short term debt investments and other financial instruments  considering reasonably possible changes in interest and currency rates 
these procedures include the use of sensitivity analysis to estimate the impact of interest rate and currency rate changes on future cash flows and fair values 
the following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate point increase in interest rates across all maturities and the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange sensitive instruments based on a increase in us dollar per local currency exchange rates across all maturities at december  dollars in millions estimated face or carrying fair increase decrease notional amount value value in fair value interest rate sensitive instruments short term debt investments long term debt including current maturities    interest rate swaps foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments foreign currency forward agreements written foreign currency forward agreements held foreign currency options held asset or liability excludes capitalized leases 
increases and decreases in the fair value of foreign currency forward agreements are completely offset by changes in the fair value of net underlying foreign currency transaction exposures 
the above discussion of the company s procedures to monitor market risk and the estimated changes in fair value resulting from the company s sensitivity analyses are forward looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur 
actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimated results due to actual developments in the global financial markets 
the analysis methods used by the company to assess and mitigate risk discussed above should not be considered projections of future events or losses
