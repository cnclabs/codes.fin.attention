the reit provisions of the internal revenue code restrict indymac reit s ability to retain earnings and thereby replenish the capital committed to its mortgage portfolio  conduit operations  commercial lending and other operations by requiring indymac reit to distribute to its shareholders substantially all of its taxable income from operations 
certain of the company s material businesses  including its mortgage conduit and commercial lending operations  are known to require significant and continuing commitments of capital resources 
management believes that the company s cash flow from operations and the company s existing financing arrangements are currently sufficient to meet the company s current short term liquidity requirements 
to the extent the company possesses working capital in excess of its current liquidity requirements  such working capital is as a general matter utilized to repay borrowings under those tranches of the company s lines of credit which carry higher rates of interest  which borrowings would typically remain available for reborrowing by the company pursuant to the terms and conditions of the applicable credit facility 
the company s ability to meet its long term liquidity requirements is subject to the renewal of its repurchase and credit facilities and or obtaining other sources of financing  including issuing additional debt or equity from time to time 
any decision by the company s lenders and or investors to make additional funds available to the company in the future will depend upon a number of factors  such as the company s compliance with the terms of its existing credit arrangements  the company s financial performance  industry and market trends in the company s various businesses  the general availability of and rates applicable to financing and investments  such lenders and or investors own resources and policies concerning loans and investments  and the relative attractiveness of alternative investment or lending opportunities 
cash flows operating activities during the year ended december   the company s operating activities required cash of approximately million 
the primary operating activity for which cash was used during the year ended december  was the acquisition of mortgage loans and manufactured housing loans held for sale 
investing activities the primary investing activities for which cash was used during the year ended december  were the acquisition of mortgage loans held for investment  the purchase of mortgage securities and the funding of construction loans receivable 
the net cash used in investing activities totaled billion for the year ended december  financing activities net cash provided by financing activities amounted to billion for the year ended december  the cash provided by financing activities was primarily the result of additional borrowings under repurchase agreements and other credit facilities during and proceeds of common stock issuances pursuant to the dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan during the year ended december  effect of interest rate changes due to the characteristics of certain financial assets and liabilities of the company  and the nature of the company s business activities  the company s financial position and results of operations may be materially affected by changes in interest rates in various ways 
with respect to its financial assets and liabilities  the company has devised and implemented a general asset liability investment management strategy which seeks  on an economic basis  to mitigate significant fluctuations in the financial position and results of operations of the company likely to be caused by changes in market interest rates 
this strategy attempts  among other things  to balance investments in various types of financial instruments whose values could be expected to move inversely to each other in response to movements in market interest rates 
however  there can be no assurance that this strategy including assumptions concerning the correlation thought to exist between different types of instruments or its implementation will be successful in any particular interest rate environment 
financial assets of the company that tend to increase in value as interest rates increase  and decline in value as interest rates decrease would include interest only securities 
these financial assets carry an implicit yield that is based upon estimates of future cash flows on an underlying pool of mortgage loans 
as interest rates increase  the prepayments on the underlying pool of mortgage loans tends to slow  resulting in higher residual cash flows than would otherwise have been obtained  and therefore  results in higher implicit yields 
as of december   indymac reit and indymac operating on a combined basis held million of interest only securities 
of the million aggregate amount  million of such assets are classified as trading securities in accordance with the requirements of sfas  since they were acquired in connection with the securitization of loans held for sale by indymac operating 
financial instruments of the company that tend to decrease in value as interest rates increase  and increase in value as interest rates decline  would include remic senior securities  fixed rate subordinated securities  adjustable rate agency securities  principal only securities  us treasury bonds and inverse floater securities 
similar to the interest only securities  the principal only and inverse floater securities carry an implicit yield based upon estimates of future cash flows on an underlying pool of mortgage loans 
however  the principal only and inverse floater securities generally sell at a discount  similar to a zero coupon bond  in order to yield an estimated return 
if interest rates increase and prepayments slow in comparison to assumed prepayment rates  the repayment rate of the principal only and inverse floater security would tend to lengthen and thus reduce the implicit yield on the security 
conversely  if interest rates decrease  the rate of prepayment on the underlying pool of loans would tend to increase  resulting in a more rapid rate of repayment on the principal only security and inverse floater security and therefore a higher implicit yield 
to a lesser extent  any mortgage securities held by the indymac reit or indymac operating and supported by adjustable rate mortgage loans may decline in value as interest rates increase  if the timing or absolute level of interest rate adjustments on the underlying loans do not correspond to applicable increases in market interest rates 
as of december   indymac reit and indymac operating on a combined basis held million of remic senior securities  fixed and adjustable rate subordinated securities  adjustable rate agency securities  principal only securities  us treasury bonds and inverse floater securities 
of the million aggregate amount  million of such securities are classified as trading securities 
in addition to the inherent risks in seeking to manage fluctuations in the value of certain assets due to interest rate changes  there may be timing differences in the recognition of the offsetting effects of gains and losses which are attributable to specific instruments  depending upon whether a security is classified as trading or available for sale 
the unrealized holding gains and losses on trading securities are recognized in earnings of the period for the company 
by comparison  the unrealized holding gains and losses of securities available for sale are excluded from earnings of the company and included as a separate component of shareholders equity 
therefore  to the extent that the company is required under gaap to classify certain securities as trading  such identification and the resulting accounting could cause additional volatility in the company s future reported earnings in periods where interest rates fluctuate 
the company is also subject to certain business and credit risks in connection with interest rate changes 
increases in interest rates may discourage potential mortgagors from borrowing or refinancing mortgage or manufactured housing loans  thus decreasing the volume of loans available to be purchased through the company s conduit operations  or financed through the company s construction and warehouse lending operations 
additionally  with respect to adjustable rate loans  the rate of delinquency may increase in periods of increasing interest rates as borrowers face higher mortgage payments 
the company s liquidity position and net interest income could also be adversely impacted by significant interest rate fluctuations 
each of the company s collateralized borrowing facilities described above in liquidity and capital resources permits the lender or lenders thereunder to require the company to repay amounts outstanding and or pledge additional assets in the event that the value of the pledged collateral declines due to changes in market interest rates 
in the event of such a decrease in collateral values  it could be necessary for the company to provide additional funds and or pledge additional assets to maintain financing for its holdings that have not been financed to maturity through the issuance of cmos or other longer term debt securities 
in addition  increases in short term borrowing rates relative to rates earned on asset holdings that have not been financed to maturity through the issuance of cmos or other debt securities may also adversely affect the company s spread income on such assets and thus reduce the company s earnings 
systems issues associated with the year the company is conducting a comprehensive review of its computer systems to determine if they will be affected by the year issue computer programs and embedded logic devices that utilize two digits rather than four to define the applicable year may fail to properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to generally  the company is not affected by issues resulting from the use of legacy computer systems and software because it commenced its active operating businesses within the past five years 
accordingly  the company does not anticipate incurring year systems compliance costs that would be material to its financial position  results of operations  or cash flows in future periods 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s depository institutions  lenders  custodians  vendors  and clients will timely resolve their own year compliance issues or that any failure by these other parties to resolve such issues would not have an adverse effect on the company s operations and financial condition 
management believes it is devoting the necessary resources to timely address all year issues over which it has control
