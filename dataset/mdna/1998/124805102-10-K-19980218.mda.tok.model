the increase corresponds directly to the increase in premium volume 
as a percentage of net written premiums  policy acquisition expenses were and for the year ended december  and  respectively

the inclusion of the return of ceding commissions as an other expense item conforms to insurance industry standards

net corporate interest income net corporate interest income increased to  for the year ended december  from zero in such increase was attributable to the increase in cash and cash equivalent balances for the company  excluding specialty insurance and outsourced business services 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  total revenues increased million  or  from million in to million in premiums earned increased approximately  on an increase of million in net written premiums in much of the increase in net written premiums was recorded in the second half of  which directly impacted century s earned premium 
on a gross written basis  century reported an increase of million in  million of which was generated through brokerages and  of which was generated through general agencies 
these increases were offset by a million decline in century s remedial action coverages 
century reported increases in net investment income of  and net realized gains on investments of million in net investment income grew on invested assets of million in century s million increase in net realized gains on investments from  in to million in is attributable to the gains realized on the sale of certain equity investments 
other income increased  in over and is attributable to non recurring income of million from the american sentinel settlement  higher commission income of  and smr revenues of  since its acquisition 
total expenses increased million to million in from million in such increase was primarily attributable to an increase in loss and loss adjustment expenses lae of million  and an increase in operating expenses of million  which reflects the impact of the company s acquisitions made in while losses incurred have increased  loss development from prior years increased million and primarily relate to property losses  which were higher than normal 
in addition  century has experienced increases in lae to million in from million in such increases are attributable to century s business mix  primarily its casualty lines of business  and to the general litigation climate 
the casualty lines of business generally have higher loss adjustment costs relative to premium dollars 
another factor affecting this increase is the court ruling in the case of montrose chemical corporation v 
admiral insurance company 
the california supreme court adopted a continuous trigger of coverage in cases involving continuous and progressive third party damage claims 
insurance companies are liable for claims occurring prior to the policy period for claims which continued to progress during the course of the policy term 
the exposure to century does not have a residual impact on loss reserves but does have a direct effect on the company s loss adjustment reserving practices due to a higher potential for claims handling and litigation costs 
income from continuing operations before taxes increased million  or  to million in from million in and net income increased  to million in from million in primarily for the reasons stated above 
combined and operating ratios the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and expense ratio and is the traditional measure of underwriting performance for insurance companies 
the operating ratio is the combined ratio less the net investment income ratio net investment income to net earned premium excluding realized and unrealized capital gains and is used to measure overall company performance 
the following table reflects the loss  lae  expense  combined  net investment and operation ratios of century on a generally accepted accounting principles gaap basis for each of the years ended december   and year ended december loss ratio lae ratio expense ratio combined ratio net investment ratio operating ratio expenses the expense ratio reflected in the foregoing table is the relationship of operating costs to net earned premiums on a gaap basis 
expense ratios have been favorably impacted by reinsurance contingencies 
liability for losses and loss expenses payable as of december   the liability for losses and lae constituted of century s consolidated liabilities 
century has established reserves that reflect its estimates of the total losses and lae it will ultimately be required to pay under insurance and reinsurance policies 
such reserves include losses that have been reported but not settled and losses that have been incurred but not reported ibnr 
loss reserves are established on an undiscounted basis after reductions for deductibles and estimates of salvage subrogation 
for reported losses  century establishes reserves on a case basis within the parameters of coverage provided in the related policy 
for ibnr losses  century estimates reserves using established actuarial methods 
case and ibnr loss reserve estimates reflect such variables as past loss experience  social trends in damage awards  changes in judicial interpretation of legal liability and policy coverages  and inflation 
century takes into account not only monetary increases in the cost of what is insured  but also changes in societal factors that influence jury verdicts and case law and  in turn  claim costs 
century s loss reserves have been certified in accordance with the requirements of the national association of insurance commissioners 
the consolidated and combined financial statements of century include the estimated liability for unpaid losses and lae of century s insurance operations 
reserves for unpaid losses covered by insurance policies and bonds consist of reported losses and ibnr losses 
these reserves are determined by claims personnel and the use of actuarial and statistical procedures and they represent undiscounted estimates of the ultimate cost of all unpaid losses and lae through year end 
although management uses many resources to calculate reserves  a degree of uncertainty is inherent in all such estimates 
therefore  no precise method for determining ultimate losses and lae exist 
these estimates are subject to the effect of future claims settlement trends and are continually reviewed and adjusted if necessary as experience develops and new information becomes known 
any such adjustments are reflected in current operations 
see footnote to the consolidated and combined financial statements contained herein for the activity in the liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses for the years ended december    and analysis of loss and lae development the historical pattern of redundancy might not be indicative of experience which may emerge in the future

the million increase from to is a result of century s generation of proceeds from stock issuances from exercises of outstanding options and warrants and the private placement defined herein  profits and additional loss reserves on an increasing volume of liability coverages which have slower payout patterns than property coverages 
net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended december    and was million  million  and million  respectively 
these amounts were adequate to meet the majority of century s capital expenditure  operating and acquisition costs and resulted primarily from earnings and the timing of reinsurance contingency transactions 
net cash provided by used in financing activities for the years ended december    and was million  million  and million  respectively 
during  century realized approximately million in cash proceeds from a private placement and from stock issuances  offset in part by dividends paid to alliance holding by csc and csu prior to the merger transactions 
sources of cash the company s principal source of revenue from its business outsourcing services operation is the collection of fees from professional services rendered to its clients in the areas of information technology consulting  tax return preparation and compliance  and business valuations  as well as other areas that have been previously discussed 
century s principal source of revenue from its specialty insurance services operations consists of insurance and reinsurance premiums  investment income  commission and fee income  and proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities 
premiums written become premiums earned for financial statement purposes as the premium is earned incrementally over the term of each insurance policy and after deducting the amount of premium ceded to reinsurers pursuant to reinsurance treaties or agreements 
the property and liability operation of century generates positive cash flow from operations as a result of premiums being received in advance of the time when the claim payments are made 
the companies of the csc group are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance regulatory agencies  applicable generally to each insurance company in its state of incorporation 
such regulations limit the amount of dividends or distributions by an insurance company to its shareholders 
if insurance regulators determine that payment of a dividend or any other payment to an affiliate such as a payment under a tax allocation agreement would  because of the financial condition of the paying insurance company or otherwise  be detrimental to such insurance company s policyholders or creditors  the regulators may block payment of such dividend or such other payment to the affiliates that would otherwise be permitted without prior approval 
ohio law limits the payment of dividends to century 
the maximum dividend that may be paid without prior approval of the director of insurance of the state of ohio is limited to the greater of the statutory net income of the preceding calendar year or of total statutory shareholder s equity as of the prior december the company has a million revolving credit facility with bank of america  national trust savings association bank of america  as agent 
at december   approximately million was outstanding under such credit facility 
the interest rate under the credit facility is  at the company s option  either a the higher of i per annum above the latest federal funds rate or ii the rate of interest in effect from time to time announced by the bank of america  san francisco  california office as its reference rate  or b a floating rate based on certain offshore dollar interbank market rates 
the credit facility requires the company to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants  including a observance of various financial and other covenants  b restrictions on additional indebtedness  c restrictions on dividend payments and d restrictions on certain liens  mergers  dispositions of assets and investments 
the company must also maintain a net worth equal to the sum of a million plus b of subsequent net income plus c the proceeds of any equity security offerings

each unit consisted of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock of century at an exercise price of per share exercisable  in whole or in part  for a three year period from the date of issuance 
the private placement resulted in net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting the placement agent fee and other estimated expenses associated with the private placement

on february   the company accepted subscriptions for  shares of the company s common stock  consisting of  newly issued shares and  shares of outstanding common stock offered by certain selling shareholders 
the company received proceeds of approximately million for the newly issued shares 
such proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes  including acquisitions 
additionally  the selling shareholders either exercised or caused to be exercised an aggregate of million warrants  resulting in additional proceeds to the company of million 
a subscription for  shares of the  shares was received from westbury

uses of cash and liquidity outlook operations 
century made capital expenditures of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  which included expenditures for fixed assets for normal replacement  compliance with regulations and market development 
during the year ended december   century funded capital expenditures from cash on hand and operating cash flow 
century anticipates that during  it will continue to fund expenditures from operating cash flow supplemented by borrowing under its revolving credit facility  as necessary 
management believes that century currently has sufficient cash and lines of credit to fund current operations and expansion thereof 
cash used in investing activities for the years ended december   and primarily came as the result of differences in the purchases and sales of investments and the effect of certain business acquisitions 
century is required to establish a reserve for unearned premiums 
century s principal costs and factors in determining the level of profit are the difference between premiums earned and losses  lae and agent commissions 
loss and lae reserves are estimates of what an insurer expects to pay on behalf of claimants 
century is required to maintain reserves for payment of estimated losses and lae for both reported claims and for ibnr claims 
although the ultimate liability incurred by century may be different from current reserve estimates  management believes that the reserves are adequate 
century believes its cash flow from operations and available financial resources provide for adequate liquidity to fund existing and anticipated capital and operational requirements as well as to fund future growth and expansion 
management is not aware of any current recommendations by regulatory authorities that  if implemented  could have a material impact on century s liquidity  capital resources and operations 
year the company s business depends in part upon its ability to store  retrieve  process and manage significant databases and periodically  to expand and upgrade its information processing capabilities 
the company recognizes the need to ensure its operations will not be adversely impacted by year software failures 
the company has reviewed and continues to review  on a regular basis  its computer equipment and software systems with regard to year problems 
the company has formulated a plan and methodology for addressing year problems and is currently implementing such plans 
acquisitions 
century s strategy is to expand aggressively its specialty insurance and business outsourcing services operations through internal growth and by acquiring and integrating existing businesses 
century makes its decision to acquire or invest in businesses based on financial and strategic considerations 
the company normally funds its acquisitions through a combination of restricted common stock and cash 
see business and properties business strategy 
the businesses acquired to date  with one exception  have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  are included in the financial statements from the date of acquisition 
on november   the company filed two shelf registration statements with the securities and exchange commission to register an aggregate of  shares of common stock to be issued from time to time in connection with acquisitions and up to an aggregate of  of debt securities  common stock or warrants to be issued and sold from time to time by the company 
the registration statements became effective in december to date  the company has not issued any securities under either registration statement 
management believes that century currently has sufficient resources  including cash on hand  cash flow from operating activities  credit facilities and access to financial markets to fund current and planned operations  service any outstanding debt and make certain acquisitions 
however  substantial additional capital may be necessary to fully implement century s aggressive acquisition program 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on a timely basis  if at all  or that it will be available in the amounts or on terms acceptable to century
