item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company derives its revenues primarily from the sale of semiconductor products falling into two main groups dsp circuits and sram circuits 
the revenue and gross margin contributed by each of the products making up these groups are subject to i availability of such product from the wafer foundry producing it  ii market demand for the product  iii average selling price for the product and iv costs of production 
the company s net revenues  gross margin  operating income and net income can depend upon the success of one or a small number of its products in any given accounting period 
the company believes that in the future its net revenues and operating results may change from period to period depending upon the success of new product introductions  the timing of large orders  and other cyclical factors affecting the semiconductor industry in general 
the company has derived revenues from technology licensing fees  but does not expect such fees to be a significant portion of revenues in the future 
the company believes that relationships with silicon wafer suppliers can provide it with reliable sources of wafers while sparing the company the substantial investment in capital equipment required to establish a wafer fabrication facility 
during and  the company was unable to receive adequate supplies of processed wafers conforming to the company s quality standards from its then foundry suppliers  and accordingly  the company s business and relationships with its customers were adversely affected 
in  the company had an abundant supply of wafer material from its suppliers as world wide wafer fabrication capacity became more readily available 
the company took advantage of this capacity by purchasing last run material on several of its products utilizing older process technologies rather than re tool these products to newer process technologies 
the company works closely with the foundries in order to take advantage of their processing capabilities and continues to explore and develop additional foundry relationships in order to minimize its dependence on any single relationship 
see business wafer fabrication technology 
the company s in house production capabilities consist of wafer testing  package marking  hot and cold testing  assembled product testing  final inspection  and quality reliability screening 
these production activities are included as cost components in the company s cost of sales 
the company began subcontracting all its assembly operations in as a means for further cost savings and more efficient operations 
the company historically has maintained high levels of inventory in recognition of the economics of having relatively small lot runs of its products processed by third party suppliers and in order to protect against disruptions in supplies 
it is the company s policy to provide reserves for any product material that is over one year old with no back log or sales activity  and to book reserves for future obsolescence 
the company expects to continue to make substantial commitments to research and development of new products and to improve existing products 
the company introduced new products in in addition to the catalog products currently offered  the company is continuously developing additional products  some of which are expected to be introduced in the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of net revenues rounded to the nearest whole percent represented by certain items of the company s consolidated statements of operations year ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative total operating expenses loss income from operations interest expense  net loss income before income taxes income taxes net loss income results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net revenues for the year ended december  were  essentially unchanged from the  recorded in the year ended december  in early  the federal communication commission announced that it would require broadcasters in the ten largest market areas to begin digital television broadcasting by the fall of the immediate response to this announcement was to slow planned incremental upgrades of existing studio equipment while broadcasters assessed the requirements to move to digital television broadcasting 
as a result of this pause in end equipment purchases  sales of the company s components to studio equipment manufacturers was adversely impacted 
also during  the company experienced periods where it was unable to support certain of its sram product types due to a transition to manufacturing these products with newer process technology 
cost of revenues increased from  in the year ended december  to  in the year ended december  gross profit decreased from  in to  due to this increase in cost of goods sold 
gross profit margin as a percentage of sales decreased from for to in this decrease in gross profit dollars and lower gross profit margin on revenue from product sales in was due to higher inventory write downs in the period 
research and development expenses were  in the year ended december  versus  in the year ended december  research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased from in to in research and development expenses were essentially the same for the and periods as a result of fewer mature product re tooling charges for the period offset by substantial investments in r d personnel and design software which will increase the new product development during selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from  in the year ended december  to  in the year ended december  the decrease was largely due to cost containment initiatives instituted in light of the company s losses during the early part of as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from in to in in the year ended december   operating income loss decreased to  from  in the year ended december   due to the above mentioned factors

the market price for srams fell nearly in a matter of months during the first half of srams  which accounted for of revenues in  accounted for only of revenues in the short fall was due to both price deterioration and order cancellation from many of the company s first tier customers 
the company re directed its sram sales activity towards the high reliability military and industrial segments where superior performance and reliability command more favorable pricing 
the company s dsp product line experienced a growth rate from to this growth in revenue from the company s dsp product was not enough to overcome the weakness in the sram market 
cost of revenues decreased from  in the year ended december  to  in the year ended december  gross profit decreased from  in to  due to the decrease in net revenues 
gross profit margin as a percentage of sales remained constant at for and in the decrease in gross profit dollars was due to the decrease in revenues for the company experienced a higher gross profit margin on revenue from product sales in as explained above  however  this was offset by higher inventory write downs for the period 
research and development expenses were  in the year ended december  versus  in the year ended december  research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased from in to in research and development expenses were essentially the same for the and periods as a result of fewer new product development tooling charges for the period offset by substantial investments in r d personnel and design software which increased the new product development during although the new personnel and software were employed in late  the full year effect of their costs along with new product tooling costs primarily impacted r d expenditures 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from  in the year ended december  to  in the year ended december  the increase was largely due to higher sales and marketing expenses associated with increased sales personnel and the opening of new sales offices in late and in and a decrease in the overall revenues of the company 
the company incurred additional marketing expenses in an effort to identify new potential markets and products for future development 
the company incurred some nonrecurring costs associated with the move of its corporate headquarters in the fourth quarter of as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from in to in in the year ended december   operating income decreased to  from  in the year ended december   due to the above mentioned factors

such after tax cash earnings  in   in  and  in as well as bank borrowings have served as a primary source of financing for the company s working capital needs and for capital expenditures during these years 
during  the company s after tax cash earnings net loss of  plus non cash items of  along with a decrease in inventories of  was offset by growth in accounts receivables of  these items along with net other cash flows items from operations provided a total of  in net cash from operating activities 
capital equipment expenditures and increases to other assets used  in cash 
bank borrowing provided  in cash  and repayment of long term capital lease obligation used  in cash 
net of such amounts resulted in a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of  for the period 
during  the company s after tax cash earnings net income of  plus non cash items of  along with cash provided from accounts receivables of  was more than offset by increases in inventories of  increases in inventories was funded by after tax cash earnings  cash provided from receivables and cash on hand 
these items along with net other cash flows items from operations used a total of  in net cash from operating activities 
capital equipment expenditures and increases to other assets used  in cash 
bank borrowing provided  in cash  exercise of warrants and stock options provided  in cash and repayment of long term capital lease obligation used  in cash 
net of such amounts resulted in a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of  for the period 
during  the company s after tax cash earnings provided funding for increases of  in inventories   of accounts receivable and  in net other resulting in net cash used by operations of  capital equipment expenditures and increases to other assets used  net in cash 
the company completed three private placements of securities during the period  which provided  in net cash 
repayment of bank notes including a term loan in the principal amount of  which had been used previously to repay certain debt to shareholders used  net in cash 
the company was also provided with cash flow from the exercise of certain warrants and employee stock options  which provided  in cash flow for the period 
the company believes that its after tax cash earnings  combined with reductions in the levels of inventories and accounts receivable  and financing available under its existing bank line of credit and future lease lines of credit  if any  will be sufficient to support its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
working capital the company s investment in inventories and accounts receivable has been significant and will continue to be significant in the future 
over prior periods  the company  as a nature of its business  has maintained high levels of inventories and accounts receivable 
the company relies on third party suppliers for raw materials and as a result maintains substantial inventory levels to protect against disruption in supplies 
the company has historically maintained inventory turn over of approximately days to days  since a low point in inventory levels came in and when the company had supply disruptions from one of its major suppliers 
the company looks at its inventories in relationship to its sales  which have ranged from days to days within the periods between and this inventory to sales ratio is a more stable measure of inventory levels  versus the traditional inventory turnover measure because  at the times when the company is experiencing supply disruptions  and therefore lower inventory levels  the company is also experiencing increased costs of goods due to inefficiencies in its operations stemming from sporadic deliveries which skews the numerator and denominator in different directions for inventory turns calculations 
during  the company reduced its inventory by  or by of the value at the beginning of the year 
the company seeks to continue to reduce its inventories  although new product introductions continue to assert upward pressure on inventory levels which tend to be offset by reductions in existing product inventories 
the company provides reserves for any product material that is over one year old with no backlog or sales activity  and reserves for future obsolescence 
the company also takes physical inventory write downs for obsolescence 
for the year ended december   the company took physical inventory write downs of approximately  see schedule of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the company s accounts receivable level is generally correlated to the company s previous quarter revenue level 
because of customer order scheduling  up to of the quarterly revenues are sometimes shipped in the last month of the quarter 
this has the effect of placing a large portion of the quarterly shipments reflected in accounts receivable still not yet due per the company s net day terms 
this  combined with the fact that the company s distributor customers which made up of the company s revenues generally pay days and beyond  results in the account receivable balances at the end of the quarterly period being at its highest point for the period 
although current levels of inventory and accounts receivable impact the company s liquidity  the company believes that it is a cost of doing business given the company s fabless operation 
the company continues to evaluate possibilities for diversifying its supplier base to reduce the risk of supply disruption 
however  this continues to require a significant investment in product development to tooling with new suppliers 
the company expects that as it expands its customer base it will be able to even out the flow of its shipments within its quarterly reporting periods 
the company seeks to achieve on going reductions in inventory and accounts receivable levels although it cannot guarantee that such reductions will be achieved within a precise period of time due to both its current high rate of introductions of new products into the inventory pool and its inability to control customer order schedules 
financing on june   the company renewed a  revolving line of credit with sanwa bank extending the maturity to may  the line of credit bears interest at the bank s prime rate at december  
the line of credit requires the company to maintain a minimum tangible net worth of  a maximum ratio of debt to tangible net worth of not more than to  a minimum current ratio of not less than to  a minimum quick ratio of not less than to  and profitability on a year to date basis 
as of december  the company was not in compliance with certain covenants under the borrowings  however  the company obtained a waiver from the bank 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the line of credit facility is secured by all of the assets of the company 
as of december    was available under the line of credit facility 
under the terms of its line of credit facility  the company is precluded from paying any cash dividends without the consent of the lender even if the company is in compliance with all of the financial covenants but is allowed to pay stock dividends whether or not there was any other covenant violation 
regardless of any such restrictions in its bank loan agreements  the company does not intend to pay cash dividends in the near future and anticipates reinvesting its cash flow back into operations 
warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock had been issued in connection with an extension of the shareholder loan under a loan extension and warrant purchase agreement entered into in march warrants to purchase  shares were exercised during the year ended december  and warrants to purchase  were exercised in february of the exercise price of the warrants was per share 
on february   the non employee directors of the company were granted warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
the grants were ratified by shareholders of the company at the company s annual meeting of shareholders held june  the warrants have an exercise price of per share  which was the last reported transaction price of the common stock on february   and expire on february  of these warrants  were exercised in by two of the non employee directors through loans made to them from the company 
the loans mature july and accrue interest at reference rate plus 
certain other warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock were issued by the company in connection with two of the private placements which occurred in under one transaction  the warrant gives the holders the right to purchase from the company up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to per share the last reported transaction price on august  
the warrant was exercisable immediately upon its issuance and expires on august  under the other transaction  the warrants gives the holders the right to purchase from the company up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to per share the closing bid price on september  
these warrants were exercisable immediately upon their issuance and expire on september  all of the warrants granted in these transactions are transferable by the holders thereof in accordance with applicable securities laws and the shares underlying these warrants have been registered under the securities act of  as amended 
while the company will continue to evaluate debt and equity financing opportunities  it believes its financing arrangements and cash flow generated from operations provide a sufficient base of liquidity for funding operations and capital needs to support the company s operations
