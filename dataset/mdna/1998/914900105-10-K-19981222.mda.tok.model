as of september   the company had outstanding indebtedness of million under its million credit facility the million facility  million under its metlife capital mortgage program  and million in capital lease obligations 
the million facility consists of three components  a million revolver  a million mortgage facility and a million loan

the company anticipates using the revolver portion of the million facility for the development of additional restaurants and for working capital needs 
in december  the company entered into a year mortgage loan agreement with metlife capital financial corporation in the original aggregate principal amount of million 
the loan agreement is secured by mortgages on five company owned full service properties in orlando  fl  amherst  ny  paoli  pa  williamsburg  va and columbus  oh 
the loan has a fixed annual interest rate of and requires monthly payments of principal and interest

the notional amount of this interest rate swap agreement was million 
in october  the company entered into a five year interest rate swap agreement involving the exchange of floating rate interest payment obligations for fixed rate interest payment obligations 
the notional amount of this interest rate swap agreement was million 
the company entered into these agreements in order to manage interest costs and risks associated with fluctuating interest rates and does not enter into these contracts for trading purposes 
in september  the board of directors of the company authorized the repurchase of million shares of the company s common stock though a dutch auction tender offer 
the terms of the tender offer provided that the company would purchase up to  shares subject to increase under certain circumstances of its common stock at prices  not in excess of nor less then per share  specified by tendering stockholders 
the company would then select the lowest purchase price that would allow it to purchase the  shares 
on october  the company completed the repurchase of  shares at a price of per share 
the total number of shares purchased represented approximately of the shares outstanding at the time 
the company used a portion of its million credit facility to purchase the shares tendered 
the company believes that existing cash balances  cash generated from operations and borrowing under its million facility will be sufficient to satisfy the company s working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
year compliance the company has completed its initial assessment of its computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the year issue and has developed an implementation and compliance plan to resolve the issue 
the company s current plan calls for implementation to be completed during fiscal year the year problem is a result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize the date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in system failures or miscalculations using existing software 
in addition to the assessment of in house computer systems  the company is in the process of assessing the readiness of its vendors  franchise partners and non information technology equipment for the year issue 
the company has begun discussions with its major distributor regarding year issues and has verified that its credit card processing vendor is year compliant 
contingency plans will be developed in the event that business critical vendors or franchise partners do not provide the company with satisfactory evidence of their year readiness 
the company intends to make every reasonable effort to assess the year readiness of these critical business partners and to create action plans to address the identified risks 
the company has determined that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario would result from the inability to acquire food supplies from our foodservice distributors 
the company is currently assessing this possibility and will develop a contingency plan to assure that there is adequate inventory on hand to provide service until an alternative source of supplies becomes available 
the company believes its operations will not be significantly disrupted if other third parties with whom the company has relationships with are not year compliant 
the company also believes that it will not have any material liability to third parties as a result of any potential non compliance with year issues 
all maintenance and modification costs will be expensed as incurred  while the cost of new software  if material  is being capitalized and depreciated over its expected useful life 
testing and remediation of all the company s systems and applications is expected to cost approximately  of which approximately  has been incurred as of the end of fiscal of the expected total cost of testing and remediation approximately  relates to repair issues and the remainder to replacement of equipment 
all estimated costs have been budgeted and are expected to be funded by cash flows from operations 
no information technology projects have been deferred due to year compliance efforts 
the company is not pursing independent verification of its systems as it believes that any effort would be as costly as the remediation effort and is not warranted at this time 
the company does not believe the costs related to the year compliance project will be material to its financial position or results of operations 
however  the cost of the project and the date on which the company plans to complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans  and other factors 
unanticipated failures by critical vendors  franchise partners  as well as the failure by the company to execute its own remediation efforts could have a material adverse effect on the cost of the project and its completion date 
as a result  there can be no assurance that these forward looking estimates will be achieved and the actual cost and vendor compliance could differ materially from those plans  resulting in material financial risk 
impact of inflation inflation has not been a major factor in the company s business for the last several years 
the company believes it has historically been able to pass on increased costs through menu price increases  but there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so in the future 
future increases in local area construction costs could adversely affect the company s ability to expand 
seasonality the company s business is seasonal in nature  with revenues and  to a greater degree  operating income being lower in its first and second quarters than its other quarters due to reduced winter volumes 
forward looking information certain information in this annual report on form k including  but not limited to  statements found in this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  may be forward looking statements 
actual results might differ materially from those projected in such forward looking statements 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the company s ability to open new restaurants and operate new and existing restaurants profitably  which will depend upon a number of factors including the availability of suitable sites  the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms  the securing of required governmental permits and approvals  the hiring  training and retaining of skilled management  and the availability of adequate financing  changes in local  regional and national economic conditions  especially economic conditions in the areas in which the company s restaurants are concentrated  increasingly intense competition in the restaurant industry  changes in consumer tastes and eating habits  increases in food  labor  employee benefits and similar costs  and other risks detailed from time to time in the company s periodic earnings releases and reports filed with the securities and exchange commission and the more detailed factors discussed in the company s registration statement on form s reg
