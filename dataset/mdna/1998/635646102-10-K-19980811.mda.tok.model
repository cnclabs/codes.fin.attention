this caused clearance charges to increase by  and  for sherwood securities and ndb  respectively  over the prior year 
also  payments by sherwood securities to correspondents for order flow increased by  over the prior year 
compensation and benefits increased  from  in to  in the increase was primarily due to higher commissions paid to sherwood securities traders due to increased trading profits and higher bonuses accrued as a result of greater overall profits of the company as compared to the prior year

travel and entertainment expense increased  from  in to  in and reflects primarily the entertaining of customers by the institutional sales force

income of equitrade allocated to minority partners represents the share of equitrade s net income allocated to the partners of equitrade  other than the company  during the year ended may  and the last quarter of fiscal the increase in income tax expense is primarily due to the company s utilization of the remainder of its net operating loss carryforwards for federal  state and local tax purposes during the year ended may   in addition to the increase in income before taxes as compared to the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources the company s tangible assets are highly liquid  but subject to market price fluctuation  with more than consisting of cash or assets readily convertible into cash principally firm securities positions  receivables from brokers and cash

ndbg s broker dealer subsidiaries  sherwood securities  ndb and equitrade are subject to the minimum net capital requirement of the sec which is designed to measure the general financial soundness and liquidity of brokers 
as of may   sherwood securities  ndb and equitrade had approximately   and  in excess of the minimum required net capital requirements  respectively  representing increases of  for sherwood securities   for ndb and  for equitrade  from the prior year 
the increase for sherwood securities resulted primarily from loans repaid by ndbg and from the year s net income 
the increase in ndb s excess net capital was principally the result of the year s net income 
equitrade s excess net capital increase was principally due to fiscal year net income offset by distributions made to partners 
the net capital rule imposes financial restrictions upon sherwood securities  ndb s and equitrade s businesses which are more severe than those imposed on most other businesses 
cash flows from operations vary on a daily basis as the company s portfolio of marketable securities changes 
the company s ability to convert marketable securities owned into cash is determined by the depth of the market and the size of the company s security positions in relation to the market as a whole 
the portfolio mix also affects the regulatory capital requirements imposed on sherwood securities  ndb and equitrade which directly affects the amount of funds available for operating  investing and financing activities 
from time to time  the company has needed to borrow funds in connection with its trading activities 
the company currently has no committed lines of credit and  in the past  such borrowings were done on an as needed basis 
on december   the company entered into an agreement with iat reinsurance syndicate ltd 
iat  a bermuda corporation  for the sale of  shares of the company s common stock at per share

fixed assets and computer software of approximately  were purchased and placed into service by ndb during the year ended may  in connection with the upgrade of ndb s technological infrastructure 
the company anticipates that it will spend an additional  and  over the next year for the ongoing upgrades of ndb s and sherwood securities technological infrastructures  respectively  and intends to finance these upgrades out of internally generated funds

on october   the company paid  for  shares of common stock of emmett a 
larkin company  inc  a minority owned broker dealer

larkin company  inc on november   the company loaned  to eurotech ltd

common stock 
the loan was repaid in full on march  during december and january  an aggregate of  shares of this common stock was sold with the company recognizing a gain of approximately  during the year ended may   the company made two loans of  each to ndb  in the form of subordination agreements 
these funds were expended in order for ndb to maintain adequate regulatory capital levels 
the company will make additional loans or contributions to its broker dealer subsidiaries  as necessary  to ensure regulatory compliance in december  the company announced it would buy back up to  shares of the company s common stock from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
through may    shares had been repurchased  of which  were repurchased during fiscal in june  the board of directors authorized an interim program to repurchase up to an additional  shares of the company s common stock 
from june  to july    additional shares were repurchased under the programs 
the source of funds for these purchases was internally generated 
sherwood securities  ndb s and equitrade s excess net capital are deemed adequate by management for their present operations and currently anticipated future expansion 
effects of inflation the company s assets are not significantly affected by inflation because they are primarily monetary in nature 
management believes that replacement costs of furniture  equipment and leasehold improvements will not materially affect operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects the company s principal expenses such as employee benefits and compensation  rent and communication  which may not be readily recoverable from increased revenues 
due to market forces and competitive conditions in the securities industry  a broker dealer may be unable to unilaterally increase spreads and commissions in order to recover increased costs related to inflation 
consequently  the company must rely on increased volume for this purpose 
however  the company has significant cash balances on deposit with its principal clearing broker which  in the event there are higher interest rates  would offset some of the costs 
impact of the year issue certain of the company s systems have potential operational problems in connection with applications that contain a date and or use a date in a comparative manner as the date transitions into the year the company has a comprehensive program to identify and remediate potential problems related to the year in its information systems and infrastructure 
in addition  the company has initiated formal communications with all of its significant external interfaces to determine their own potential problems and plans related to the year  although management presently has no assurance that such plans will be implemented on a timely basis 
the inability of the company or significant external interfaces of the company to adequately address year issues could cause disruption of the company s business operations 
many of the company s systems are year compliant  or have been scheduled for replacement in the company s ongoing systems plans 
the company has incurred and expensed approximately  during the fiscal year ended may  related to the assessment of  and preliminary efforts in connection with  its year program and remediation plan 
future spending for software modifications and testing required for year are currently estimated to be approximately  with the majority expected to be incurred in the fiscal year ended may  the company s target date for completing its year modifications is december  with additional testing and refinements to identified systems planned for forward looking statement statements regarding the company s expectations as to its future operations and financial condition and certain other information contained in this form k or in documents incorporated herein by reference constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of although the company believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its business and operation  there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from its expectations 
factors which could cause actual results to differ from expectations include a general downturn in the economy  changes in the level of activity of securities markets in which the company participates  changes in government policy or regulation and unforeseen costs and other effects related to legal proceedings or investigations of governmental and self regulatory organizations
