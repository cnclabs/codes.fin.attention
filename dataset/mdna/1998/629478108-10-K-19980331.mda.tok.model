the success of the company is dependent on its ability to generate adequate cash for operations and capital needs 
its ability to generate adequate cash for such needs is in part dependent on its success in increasing sales of its products 
the company has developed a plan to increase revenues through sales of its network exchange product line  however  due to market conditions and other factors beyond its control  there can be no assurance the company will be able to adequately increase product sales 
therefore  the company may have to generate additional cash through the sales of assets including technologies or the sale of debt or equity securities 
although the company believes it has the ability to generate additional cash through such sales  such sales may be dilutive and there can be no assurances that adequate funds will be available or available on terms that are reasonable or acceptable to the company 
if the company is unable to generate adequate cash  there could be a material and adverse effect on the business and financial condition of the company 
therefore  the company has also developed a plan to implement certain cost control measures to mitigate its liquidity risk 
certain factors that may affect future results the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time

therefore  the company has also developed a plan to implement certain cost control measures to mitigate its liquidity risk 
the company s future operating results are difficult to predict and may be affected by a number of factors including the timing of new product announcements or introductions by the company and its competitors  competitive pricing pressures and economic conditions in the united states and international markets 
as a result of these and other factors  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis 
a limited number of relatively large customer orders has accounted for and is likely to continue to account for a substantial portion of revenues in any particular fiscal period 
as a result  the timing of orders could significantly affect the company s operating results 
in any period  the unexpected loss of or decline in revenues from a major customer  or the failure to generate significant revenues from other customers  could have an adverse effect on the business and operating results of the company 
although the company s expense levels are based in part on its expectations as to future revenue  most expenses are relatively fixed and cannot be adjusted in the short term 
accordingly if revenue levels are below expectations  operating results could be adversely affected 
in addition  the company s products often represent a significant capital expenditure for its customers and  for that reason  the company s operating results may vary significantly depending upon general economic conditions and customers budgetary cycles 
a portion of the company s revenues results from sales to the united states government  primarily through systems integrators 
the revenues generated by this government business  which is spread across numerous agencies and departments  could be adversely affected by governmental budgetary or fiscal restraints or changes in government policy 
the market for the company s products is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and changes in telecommunications services offered by public carriers 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards or telecommunications services may adversely affect the company s ability to market its products 
this may require the company to make substantial expenditures on research and development in order to develop new products or to maintain the competitiveness of its existing products 
the company s ability to anticipate changes in technology and in industry standards  to anticipate changes in market requirements and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis  will be a significant factor in the company s ability to remain competitive 
if the company is unable  for technological  financial or other reasons  to develop  introduce and successfully market products in a timely manner in response to changes in the industry  the company s business would be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  the company has experienced delays in releasing certain of its products and there can be no assurance that it will not encounter technical or other difficulties that could delay the introduction or release of new products in the future 
the development and introduction of new and enhanced products requires a significant investment of financial resources 
to the extent that the company s existing financial resources are insufficient to fund the company s activities  additional funds will be required 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms reasonable to the company or at all 
the market for networking systems is extremely competitive 
many of the company s competitors are more established  benefit from greater market recognition and have greater financial  technological  production and marketing resources than the company 
competition could increase if new companies enter the market or if existing competitors expand their product lines 
an increase in competition could have an adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
maintaining the competitiveness of the company s products will require continued investment by the company in research and development and sales and marketing 
there can be no assurance that the company will have sufficient resources to make such investment or that the company will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain the competitiveness of its products 
a significant portion of the company s total revenues has been derived from international sales  and the company expects that international business will continue to represent an important element of its business 
substantially all of the company s international sales have been made through third party distributors  and in many cases the company relies upon only one distributor for a particular country 
a reduction in the sales by some or all of these distributors or a termination of their relationships with the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations and financial performance 
in addition  the company s international business may be adversely affected by changes in demand for its products resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates  as well as by risks such as trade and tariff regulations  political instability  difficulties in obtaining export licenses  difficulties or delays in collecting accounts receivable and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 
the company s success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of its executive officers and other key personnel 
none of the company s executive officers or key employees is subject to an employment or non competition agreement 
the loss of the services of any of its executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s future success will depend in part upon its continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
the company relies on reseller channels  including distributors and systems integrators  for a significant portion of its revenues 
none of these resellers are under the control of the company and there can be no assurance that future sales by resellers will continue at present levels or will not decline 
the loss of one or more significant resellers could adversely affect the company s business 
in addition  the company relies on resellers to provide certain limited service and support to their customers  and any deficiencies in such service and support could adversely affect the company s business and operating results 
certain components used in the company s products are currently available from only one source and others are available from only a limited number of sources 
although the company has generally been able to obtain adequate supplies of components to date  the company s inability to develop alternative sources if and as required in the future  or to obtain sufficient sole source or limited source components as required  could result in delays or reductions in product shipments  which could adversely affect the company s operating results 
certain products that are or may in the future be marketed with or incorporated into the company s products are supplied by or under development by third parties 
these third parties may be the sole suppliers of such products 
the company also currently relies on a single contract manufacturer to assemble and test most of the company s products 
although a number of such contract manufacturers exist  the interruption or termination of the company s current manufacturing relationship could have a short term adverse effect on the company s business 
the inability of any such third parties to supply  develop or manufacture components or products in a timely manner or the termination of the company s relationship with any such third party could delay shipment of the company s products and could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results 
because of these and other factors  past financial performance should not be considered an indicator of future performance 
investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results and should be aware that the trading price of the company s common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  general conditions in the networking industry  changes in earnings estimates and recommendations by analysts or other events
