item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the corporation achieved significant financial success as it reported all time record sales and earnings  as well as much improved cash flow 
the focus on enhancing shareholder value resulted in improved performance in virtually all of the corporation s businesses 
during the year  the corporation completed a number of strategic repositioning moves 
on august   the corporation divested the net assets of acme frame products  inc and wilhold  inc  which allowed a re allocation of resources to initiatives with more potential for long term  profitable growth 
successful initiatives to manage working capital and improve cash flow continued from and a share repurchase of million shares of class a common stock was announced and completed 
the share repurchase was funded by the divestiture proceeds and internal cash flow 
the corporation continuously reviews its portfolio of businesses on an ongoing basis to ensure that growth opportunities are pursued and return on investments are aligned with its long term goals 
the acquisition of john sands in and the divestiture are examples of this process 
in march of the corporation acquired london based camden graphics group which increased our market share and growth potential in the united kingdom 
the corporation is currently pursuing other growth opportunities in the uk 
however  the possible consummation of any such transaction is unlikely to have a material effect on the corporation s results as a whole 
results of operations revenues the net sales increase of in over  while adversely impacted by a number of factors  represented the corporation s nd consecutive year of growth 
the divestiture of acme frame products  inc and wilhold  inc 
in the second quarter of  a de emphasis on sales of lower margin seasonal gift accessories and weakening of certain foreign currencies against the united states dollar  all negatively impacted sales growth 
removing the impact of these factors would result in a normalized net sales increase of approximately 
net sales increased in and in net sales of everyday cards continued to be strong and increased in after increasing in the increase in everyday card sales in reflected the strength of the everyday card market in the united states and in almost all of the corporation s foreign markets  particularly the united kingdom 
the increase also reflected the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of the john sands group  the largest greeting card business in australia and new zealand 
during  the corporation initiated efforts to improve sell through of seasonal card sales which included both targeted promotions and reduced shipments 
these efforts  which should benefit  resulted in a decrease in seasonal card net sales of 
the seasonal card increase of in reflected the improvement in the retail environment compared to total unit sales of all greeting cards increased in after increasing in demand for certain consumer products  particularly non prescription reading glasses and custom display fixtures  rebounded in after slowing somewhat in  as net sales of non card products excluding the divestiture increased  after an increase of only in the contribution of each major product category as a percent of net sales for the past three years due to the divestiture  excludes picture frames and hair accessories from all years is everyday greeting cards seasonal greeting cards gift wrapping and party goods all other products the all other products classification includes giftware  ornaments  non prescription reading glasses  educational products  candles  stationery  calendars  balloons  stickers and custom display fixtures 
expenses and profit margins the corporation s continued focus on profitability resulted in a pre tax margin of in  compared to in and in  excluding non recurring items 
continued manufacturing efficiencies and an improved product mix resulted in material  labor and other production costs which were of net sales  down from in and in the improved product mix included both the strength of high margin everyday card sales as well as the divestiture of the low margin picture frame and hair accessory businesses which provided basis points of this improvement 
in  strong high margin card sales  along with a million decrease in product cost variances related to the conversion of the canadian manufacturing operations to united states manufacturing processes contributed to the margin improvement 
the cost of providing greeting card cabinets and point of purchase displays in the united states has been well managed  remaining flat in after decreasing million in from selling  distribution and marketing expenses were of net sales  up from in and in however  these expenses increased only after increasing in  as competitive costs moderated somewhat 
as in prior years  competitive costs increased due to higher amortization of deferred costs and other expenses related to the corporation s agreements with certain retail customers 
deferred costs and the corporation s method of accounting for them are described in note f to the consolidated financial statements 
the growth of selling  distribution  and marketing expenses other than competitive costs continued to slow  and increased just in after increasing in and in administrative and general expenses were million  or of net sales compared to million or of net sales in the increase from prior year is due primarily to costs related to the conversion of information systems to be year compliant which is discussed further under year excluding the year costs  administrative and general expenses increased only in after increasing in the increase in was due to the million higher expense of the united states profit sharing plan and additional administrative and general expense from the operations of the john sands group 
interest expense decreased million in after increasing million in in strong cash flow provided by operating and investing activities resulted in lower borrowing requirements 
the increase in was due primarily to the long term debt incurred to purchase the assets of the john sands group 
the effective tax rate was compared to in and in while the rate for all three years reflected tax benefits of the corporate owned life insurance  the benefits in and were reduced due to the phase out of the federal income tax deduction for interest on loans associated with these policies 
see note j to the consolidated financial statements for details of the differences between the federal statutory rate and the effective tax rate 
non recurring items on august   the corporation divested the net assets of acme frame products  inc  a manufacturer and distributor of picture frames  and wilhold  inc  a manufacturer and distributor of hair accessories 
as a result of the transaction  the corporation recorded a non recurring gain of million million net of tax  or earnings per share of 
in the third quarter of  the corporation adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this statement requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in november  the corporation determined that the trends in the creatacard business indicated that the undiscounted future cash flows from that business would be less than the carrying value of the long lived assets related to that business 
as a result  the corporation recognized a pre tax  non cash loss of million for the asset impairment 
after the effect of income taxes  the loss was million or earnings per share of 
see note b to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impairment loss 
net income and earnings per share net income in increased to million or earnings per share of compared to net income of million or earnings per share of in and net income of million or earnings per share of in however  net income in and included the impact of non recurring gains and losses 
in  a gain was recognized upon the divestiture of the net assets of acme frame products  inc and wilhold  inc

year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the application year 
any of the corporation s computer programs that have date sensitive software may be unable to interpret appropriately the calendar year and thus could cause the disruption of normal business activities 
the corporation uses software in various aspects of its business  including manufacturing  distribution  product development  and many administrative functions  and much of this software will need to be modified or replaced 
the corporation is addressing the year issue with an enterprise wide initiative  led by the corporation s senior vice president of information services 
the corporation believes that with timely modifications to its existing software and conversion to new software  by both the corporation and its significant customers  the year issue will not have a material impact on the corporation s operations 
specific factors which might cause a material adverse effect include the availability and cost of trained personnel and the ability to recruit and retain them  as well as the ability to locate all computer codes requiring correction 
based upon information available at this time  the corporation believes that the cost of modifications  replacements and related testing will not have a material impact on the corporation s liquidity or results of operations 
year costs  which are estimated to be million for both modification to existing software and software upgrades  are being funded through operations 
liquidity and capital resources the corporation s continuing initiatives to manage working capital resulted in significant improvements in cash flow during the past two years 
cash flow from operations increased million in after increasing million in ongoing controls over inventory in  following a sizable reduction of inventories in  as well as slower growth in accounts receivable in both years contributed to the increase in cash flow 
the improvement in also included lower cash payments related to net deferred costs 
the significant improvement achieved in was also due to higher earnings 
trade accounts receivable used million of cash in compared to million in the receivable performance in both years reflect strong fourth quarter sales of everyday cards and accessories 
as a percent of net sales  accounts receivable were in  in and in inventories as a percent of material  labor and other production costs  continued to decrease and were in  compared to in and in the improvements in and reflect the corporation s focused efforts to reduce inventory levels and were driven by the greeting card divisions  where inventories declined million in after decreasing million in from levels 
payments under agreements with certain retailers net of related amortization decreased million in  after increasing million in the payments which were made in connection with both new and existing agreements reflect the fluctuations resulting from various contract payment and renewal dates 
however  the deferred costs which result from the payments are less volatile as they are amortized over the effective period of the agreement 
total commitments under the agreements are capitalized as deferred costs when the agreements are consummated  and any future payment commitments are recorded as liabilities at that time 
future payment commitments under existing agreements at the end of were million with million due within the next year 
see note f to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of deferred costs related to certain customer agreements 
investing activities include million proceeds from the divestiture of the net assets of acme frame products  inc and wilhold  inc 
on august  in  the corporation acquired substantially all of the assets from the john sands group for million in cash 
capital expenditures decreased million in from million in which reflected expenditures for the automation of distribution systems  which began in and continued during capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately million 
investing activities other than capital expenditures and divestitures and acquisitions used million less cash in after decreasing million in from the corporation s investment in corporate owned life insurance required less cash in due to reduced premium payments while the increase in resulted from a decrease in policy loans 
in june  the corporation s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of class a common stock 
the entire million shares were repurchased during at an average price of per share or million 
on march   the corporation announced that its board of directors authorized an additional repurchase of up to million shares of class a common stock 
financing activities  excluding this share repurchase program  used million of cash  including million in dividend payments  while in  financing activities used million of cash  including million in dividend payments to shareholders 
dividend payments increased million in and million in in  financing activities included a million increase in long term debt used in part to fund the purchase of assets from the john sands group 
the increase in long term debt also reflected a shift in canadian borrowings from short term to long term 
debt as a percent of total capitalization in remained at the level of after decreasing from in the corporation s operating cash flow and existing credit facilities are expected to meet currently anticipated funding requirements 
the seasonal nature of the business results in peak working capital requirements which are financed primarily through short term borrowings

factors that may affect future results during  the corporation  while continuing its long term record of sales growth and profitability  also focused on efforts to enhance shareholder value 
these efforts included improved cash flow management  the share repurchase program and the divestiture of non core businesses 
while all of these efforts were successful  future revenue trends  profit margins and customer strength are difficult to predict 
the corporation has maintained a strong customer base in a wide variety of channels of distribution through its investment in deferred costs related to agreements with certain retailers and other competitive arrangements 
the agreements have lessened the impact to the corporation from loss of business due to the retailer consolidations which continued in  particularly in the drug store channel

the corporation has included in the annual report certain information other than historical facts that may constitute forward looking information 
actual results may differ materially from these projected in the forward looking statements  including but not limited to the risks discussed above  as well as retail bankruptcies  a weak retail environment and competitive terms of sale offered to customers to expand or maintain business
