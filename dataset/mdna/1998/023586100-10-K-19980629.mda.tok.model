year disclosure the company is and has been working since to identify and evaluate the changes necessary to its existing computerized business systems to make these systems compliant for year processing 
the year processing problem is caused by currently installed computer systems and software products  including several used by the company  being coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
beginning in the year  these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
the company s date critical functions related to the year and beyond  such as rental transaction processing and financial systems may be adversely affected unless these computer systems are or become year compliant 
the company has been replacing  upgrading or modifying key financial systems in the normal course of business 
the company is utilizing both internal and external resources to identify  correct  reprogram and test its systems for year compliance 
in particular  the company has an outside consulting firm on site currently making the necessary modifications to existing systems 
the company expects to be fully year compliant by march at an estimated cost of approximately million 
although the company believes it will achieve compliance on a timely basis and does not anticipate incurring material costs beyond the estimated million  no assurance can be given that the company s computer systems will be year compliant by march or otherwise in a timely manner or that the company will not incur significant additional costs pursuing year compliance 
if the appropriate modifications are not made  or are not timely  the year problem may have a material adverse effect on the company 
furthermore  even if the company s systems will be year compliant  there can be no assurance the company will not be adversely affected by the failure of others to become year compliant 
for example  the company may be affected by  among other things  the failure of inventory suppliers  credit card processors  security companies  or other vendors and service providers to become year compliant 
in an effort to evaluate and reduce its exposure in this area  the company has ongoing communication with its vendors and other service providers about their progress in identifying and addressing problems to ensure that their computer systems will be year compliant 
however  despite the company s efforts to date  there can be no assurance that the year problem will not have a material adverse effect on the company in the future
