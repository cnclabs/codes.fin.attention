sales of raw materials and oncological products declined by 
million and 
million  respectively 
cost of goods sold increased from the prior year by approximately 
million 
without the effect of year to year changes in the foreign exchange rate  cost of goods sold would have increased by million 
bioren s cost of sales decreased 
million  after taking into account exchange impacts of 
million 
pharmaceuticals cost of goods sold increased 
million  net of foreign exchange effects of 
million 
the primary reason for the pharmaceuticals increase is the absorption of costs related to validation activities subsequent to may  when the plant obtained provisional approval to manufacture product from the iks 
in  a portion of these costs associated with completion of the production facilities were capitalized 
gross margin decreased by million to million or for the year ended december   compared to or for the year ended december  exchange rate impacts on sales offsets the exchange rate impact on cost of sales  therefore  the decrease is related to the decreased sales plus the increase in validation costs related to the fda approval process 
total operating expenses increased by  from million in to million in research and development expenses increased by 
million as a result of the company s continuing effort to develop its line of oncological products and obtain required regulatory approvals to manufacture and market those products 
based upon the number of products scheduled for registration during the next several years  the company expects research and development expenditures to continue to be significant 
selling  general and administrative expenses also increased from to the million increase primarily reflects an increase in the number of employees and related expenses both in the us and switzerland

net loss for was million versus the loss of million 
the corresponding loss per share was in versus 
in if the effects of the protyde transaction and the cerbios pharma settlement were omitted  the net losses would have been million and million for and respectively and the loss per share would have been and 
for and  respectively 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales increased by million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the comparable period in this increase was attributable to the inclusion of a full year of bioren sales million in  compared to the inclusion of only the last six months sales in  as bioren was not acquired until june excluding bioren sales  the increase in net sales was  from to this increase was due to additional sales of approximately  of pharmaceutical products  offset by a reduction of approximately  and  in prostate materials and generic oncological products  respectively  and an adverse change of approximately in exchange rates between the us dollar and the swiss franc

cost of goods sold increased by million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the comparable period in this increase was primarily due to increased sales 
gross profit increased by million to million for the year ended december over the comparable period in this increase was attributable to the addition of bioren gross profit in of million 
without the addition of bioren  gross profit for the period ended december  increased  to  as compared to  for the comparable period in this increase was due to both higher net sales and to favorable product mix 
as a percentage of sales  gross profit for the year ended december  was  an increase from for the comparable period in bigmar pharmaceuticals gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to from for the comparable period in this improvement reflects a change in the mix of products sold from period to period as prostate materials were sold in at materially lower margins than other products 
bioren gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended december  decreased to from for the comparable period in this decrease resulted primarily from competitive pricing tactics in the iv solution line

interest expense for was partially offset by interest income of  generated by investing the proceeds of the initial public offering

the company sustained a net loss of million for the year ended december  as compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  the net loss for represents an increase of million

million and million  respectively 
the company s working capital at december  was a million deficit and at december  was

million and the return of a cash advance to protyde of 
million

million and accrued expenses increased 
million 
accounts receivable also increased about 
million from year end to year end finally  notes payable increased by approximately 
million 
net cash used in operating activities during was million  down from the previous year s cash provided of 
million 
the decrease was largely a result of the million net loss incurred during the year 
however  this was offset somewhat by approximately million of depreciation and amortization  
million for the value of common stock warrants issued to protyde as partial payment to re acquire us marketing rights previously assigned to protyde  and 
million for foreign exchange losses 
capital expenditures for were million  a million decrease from the level 
the lower expenditures reflect the fact that the bigmar facility was substantially completed at the end of may and most of the property  plant and equipment related to this facility had already been acquired during in june the company completed an initial public offering through which the company received  after deducting all related offering expenses  approximately million in net proceeds 
during  the company utilized the remaining proceeds from the ipo and obtained additional financing from banca del gottardo in august 
the net proceeds from banca del gottardo amounted to 
million from the issuance of common stock and million from the issuance of convertible bonds 
the company obtained additional short term financing by securing a million line of credit from citizens bank in saginaw  michigan 
the line of credit is unsecured and  as of year end  the company had borrowed approximately million under this arrangement 
the company has incurred  and will continue to incur  substantial expenditures for research and development activities related to bringing its products to the commercial market 
the company intends to devote significant additional funds to product development  formulation  clinical testing  manufacturing validation  product registration  and other activities required for regulatory review of generic oncological products 
the amount required to complete such activities depends upon the outcome of regulatory reviews 
the regulatory bodies may require more testing than is currently planned by the company 
there can be no assurance that the company s generic oncological products will be approved for marketing by the fda or any foreign government agency or that any such products will be successfully introduced or achieve market acceptance 
the company anticipates that the net proceeds received from its recent financing activities  together with cash flow from operations if any  will be sufficient to fund the company s operations through june however  there can be no assurance that events affecting the company s operations will not result in the company depleting its funds before that time 
management is currently discussing additional financing with a number of financial institutions and investors  but there are no assurances that the company will be able to obtain additional financing or that such financing  if available  will be on acceptable terms 
year compliance many computer systems currently record years in a two digit format 
such systems  if not modified  will be unable to recognize and properly process information with dates beyond the year the potential problems arising out of this inability are commonly referred to as the year issue and will affect virtually all companies  government agencies and other organizations 
during  the company performed an assessment of its computer systems to determine whether or not they were in compliance with year requirements 
as of december   the swiss operations computer systems were determined to be in compliance with such requirements 
the us operations computer applications include an accounting package and a document management system 
although these systems do not yet comply with year requirements  an assessment has been made and it has been determined to the best of management s knowledge and belief that the costs to bring them into compliance will be immaterial to the company s business  operations  and financial condition 
the company expects to incur and expense such costs to selling  general and administrative during recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no
