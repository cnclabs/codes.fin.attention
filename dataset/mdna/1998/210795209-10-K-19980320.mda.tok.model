in september  continental completed an offering of million of pass through certificates which were used to finance the debt portion of the acquisition cost of nine embraer erj erj regional jets 
in october  the company completed an offering of million of pass through certificates to be used to finance through either leveraged leases or secured debt financings the debt portion of the acquisition cost of up to new boeing aircraft scheduled to be delivered from april through november in february  the company completed an offering of million of pass through certificates to be used to finance through either leveraged leases or secured debt financings the debt portion of the acquisition cost of up to aircraft scheduled to be delivered from february through december in addition  during and the first quarter of  continental completed several offerings totaling approximately million aggregate principal amount of tax exempt special facilities revenue bonds to finance or refinance certain airport facility projects 
these bonds are payable solely from rentals paid by continental under long term lease agreements with the respective governing bodies 
the cash proceeds from the pass through certificate transactions are deposited with a depositary bank for the benefit of the certificate holders and enable the company to finance through either leveraged leases or secured debt financings the debt portion of the acquisition cost of new aircraft 
as of march  approximately billion of the proceeds remain on deposit 
if any funds remain as deposits at the end of the specified delivery periods  such funds will be distributed back to the certificate holders 
as of december   continental had approximately billion including current maturities of long term debt and capital lease obligations  and had approximately billion of continental obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trust and common stockholders equity  a ratio of to as of december   the ratio of long term debt and capital lease obligations including current maturities to minority interest  continental obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trust  redeemable preferred stock and common stockholders equity was to as of december  the company had billion in cash and cash equivalents excluding restricted cash  compared to million as of december  net cash provided by operating activities increased million during the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year principally due to an improvement in operating income 
net cash used by investing activities for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year increased million  primarily as a result of higher capital and fleet related expenditures in and lower purchase deposits refunded in connection with aircraft delivered in net cash used by financing activities increased million primarily due to i a decrease in payments on long term debt and capital lease obligations  ii a decrease in proceeds received from the issuance of long term debt and iii an increase in warrants purchased in continental has general lines of credit and significant encumbered assets 
deferred tax assets 
the company had  as of december   deferred tax assets aggregating billion  including million of nols 
the company recorded a valuation allowance of million against such assets as of december  realization of a substantial portion of the company s remaining nols will require the completion by april  of transactions resulting in recognition of built in gains for federal income tax purposes 
in the fourth quarter of  the company determined that it would be able to recognize an additional million of nols attributable to the company s pre bankruptcy predecessor 
this benefit  million  was used to reduce reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets 
to the extent the company were to determine in the future that additional nols of the company s pre bankruptcy predecessor could be recognized in the consolidated financial statements  such benefit would also reduce reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets 
if such reorganization value is exhausted  such benefit would decrease other intangibles 
the company may consummate one or more additional built in gain transactions by april  as a result of nols  the company will not pay united states federal income taxes other than alternative minimum tax until it has recorded approximately an additional million of taxable income following december  section of the internal revenue code section imposes limitations on a corporation s ability to utilize nols if it experiences an ownership change 
in general terms  an ownership change may result from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than percentage points over a three year period 
in the event that an ownership change should occur  utilization of continental s nols would be subject to an annual limitation under section determined by multiplying the value of the company s stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long term tax exempt rate which was for february 
any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years  and the amount of the limitation may under certain circumstances be increased by the built in gains in assets held by the company at the time of the change that are recognized in the five year period after the change 
under current conditions  if an ownership change were to occur  continental s annual nol utilization would be limited to approximately million per year other than through the recognition of future built in gain transactions 
based on information currently available  the company does not believe that the air partners agreement to dispose of its interest in the company to an affiliate of northwest airlines  inc will result in an ownership change for purposes of section see item management s discussion and analyses liquidity and capital resources other 
purchase commitments 
in march  continental announced the conversion of boeing option aircraft to boeing firm aircraft and the addition of option aircraft 
as of march   continental had firm commitments with boeing to take delivery of a total of jet aircraft including the boeing aircraft described above during the years through with options for an additional aircraft exercisable subject to certain conditions 
these aircraft will replace older  less efficient stage aircraft and allow for growth of operations 
the estimated aggregate cost of the company s firm commitments for the boeing aircraft is approximately billion 
as of march   continental had completed or had third party commitments for a total of approximately billion in financing for its future boeing deliveries  and had commitments or letters of intent from various sources for backstop financing for approximately one third of the anticipated remaining acquisition cost of such boeing deliveries 
the company currently plans on financing the new boeing aircraft with a combination of enhanced equipment trust certificates  lease equity and other third party financing  subject to availability and market conditions 
however  further financing will be needed to satisfy the company s capital commitments for other aircraft and aircraft related expenditures such as engines  spare parts  simulators and related items 
there can be no assurance that sufficient financing will be available for all aircraft and other capital expenditures not covered by firm financing commitments 
deliveries of new boeing aircraft are expected to increase aircraft rental  depreciation and interest costs while generating cost savings in the areas of maintenance  fuel and pilot training 
in september  continental express  inc express placed an order for firm erj regional jets  with options for an additional aircraft exercisable through in june  express exercised its option to order of such option aircraft and expects to confirm its order for an additional of its remaining option aircraft by august neither express nor continental will have any obligation to take such aircraft that are not financed by a third party and leased to the company 
express took delivery of of the aircraft through december  and will take delivery of the remaining aircraft through the third quarter of the company expects to account for all of these aircraft as operating leases 
continental expects its cash outlays for capital expenditures  exclusive of fleet plan requirements  to aggregate million  primarily relating to mainframe  software application and automation infrastructure projects  aircraft modifications and mandatory maintenance projects  passenger terminal facility improvements and office  maintenance  telecommunications and ground equipment 
continental s capital expenditures during aggregated million  exclusive of fleet plan requirements 
the company expects to fund its future capital commitments through internally generated funds together with general company financings and aircraft financing transactions 
however  there can be no assurance that sufficient financing will be available for all aircraft and other capital expenditures not covered by firm financing commitments 
year the company uses a significant number of computer software programs and embedded operating systems that are essential to its operations 
as a result  the company implemented a year project in early to ensure that the company s computer systems will function properly in the year and thereafter 
the company anticipates completing its year project in early and believes that  with modifications to its existing software and systems and or conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
the company has also initiated communications with its significant suppliers and vendors with which its systems interface and exchange data or upon which its business depends 
the company is coordinating efforts with these parties to minimize the extent to which its business will be vulnerable to their failure to remediate their own year issues 
the company s business is also dependent upon certain governmental organizations or entities such as the federal aviation administration faa that provide essential aviation industry infrastructure 
there can be no assurance that the systems of such third parties on which the company s business relies including those of the faa will be modified on a timely basis 
the company s business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the failure of its systems or those operated by other parties to operate properly beyond to the extent possible  the company will be developing and executing contingency plans designed to allow continued operation in the event of failure of the company s or third parties systems 
the total cost excluding internal payroll costs of the company s year project is currently estimated at million and will be funded through cash from operations 
the cost of the company s year project is limited by the substantial outsourcing of its systems and the significant implementation of new systems following its emergence from bankruptcy in the costs of the company s year project and the date on which the company believes it will be completed are based on management s best estimates and include assumptions regarding third party modification plans 
however  in particular due to the potential impact of third party modification plans  there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive instruments and positions the company is subject to certain market risks  including commodity price risk ie  aircraft fuel prices  interest rate risk  foreign currency risk and price changes related to investments in equity securities 
following is a discussion of the adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks 
the sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity nor do they consider additional actions management may take to mitigate the company s exposure to such changes 
actual results may differ 
see the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s accounting policies and other information related to these financial instruments 
aircraft fuel 
the company s results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel 
during  aircraft fuel accounted for of the company s operating expenses 
based on the company s projected fuel consumption  a one cent change in the average annual price per gallon of aircraft fuel would impact the company s annual aircraft fuel expense by approximately million 
in order to provide short term protection generally three to six months against sharp increases in aircraft fuel prices  the company has entered into petroleum call options 
as of december   the company had hedged approximately of its projected fuel requirements  including related to the first quarter 
foreign currency 
the company is exposed to the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the us dollar value of foreign currency denominated operating revenue and expenses 
the company s largest exposure comes from the japanese yen 
the result of a uniform strengthening in the value of the us dollar from december  levels relative to the yen is estimated to result in a decrease in operating income of approximately million for however  the company has mitigated the effect of certain of these potential foreign currency losses by purchasing foreign currency average rate option contracts that effectively enable it to sell japanese yen expected to be received from yen denominated ticket sales over the next nine to twelve months at specified dollar amounts 
as of december   the company had purchased average rate options to hedge approximately of its projected net yen denominated cash flows 
interest rates 
the company s results of operations are affected by fluctuations in interest rates eg  interest expense on debt and interest income earned on short term investments 
the company had approximately million of variable rate debt as of december  if average interest rates increased by during as compared to  the company s projected interest expense would increase by approximately million 
the company has mitigated its exposure on certain variable rate debt by entering into an interest rate cap notional amount of million as of december  which expires in july the interest rate cap limits the amount of potential increase in the eurodollar or prime rate component of the floating rate to a maximum of over the term of the contract 
as of december   the fair value of million carrying value of the company s fixed rate debt was estimated to be million  based upon discounted future cash flows using current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments or market prices 
market risk  estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates  was approximately million as of december  the fair value of the remaining fixed rate debt with a carrying value of million and primarily relating to aircraft modification notes and various loans with immaterial balances was not practicable to estimate due to the large number and small dollar amounts of these notes 
if average short term interest rates decreased by over average rates  the company s projected interest income from short term investments would decrease by approximately million during preferred securities of trust 
as of december   the fair value of continental s convertible trust originated preferred securities was estimated to be million using market prices  which exceeded the carrying value of these securities by million 
market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in market prices and was estimated to be million as of december  investments in equity securities 
continental s investment in america west holdings corporation at december   which was recorded as its fair value of million and includes unrealized gains of million  has exposure to price risk 
this risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in prices quoted by stock exchanges and amounts to million 
the company also has an investment in amadeus which is also subject to price risk 
however  since a readily determinable market value does not exist for amadeus it is privately held  the company is unable to quantify the amount of price risk sensitivity inherent in this investment
