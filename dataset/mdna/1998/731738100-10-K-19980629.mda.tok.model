forward looking statements include  among others statements regarding possible future expansion of diabetes coverage under medicare  statements regarding future benefits from the company s advertising and promotional expenditures  statements regarding future product revenue levels  statements regarding product development  introduction and marketing  and statements regarding future acquisitions 
all forward looking statements included in this report are based on information available to the company on the date hereof  and the company assumes no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
it is important to note that the company s actual results could differ materially from those in such forward looking statements 
the future operating results of the company remain difficult to predict 
the company continues to face many risks and uncertainties which could affect its operating results  including without limitation  those described below 
healthcare reimbursement political  economic and regulatory influences are resulting in fundamental changes in the healthcare industry in the united states 
the company anticipates that congress and state legislatures will continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems and payment methods 
sales of a large portion of the company s products depend to a significant extent on the availability of reimbursement to the company s customers by government and private insurance plans 
any further reduction in the reimbursement provisions currently in effect for the company s diabetes supplies products which are reimbursable under medicare would reduce the company s revenues and earnings 
the processing of third party reimbursements is a labor intensive effort  and delays in processing claims for reimbursement may increase working capital requirements 
final determination of reimbursements are subject to audit by medicare 
medicare audits of the company to date have not resulted in any significant adjustments 
future audits may  however  result in retroactive adjustments for past charges for products and services  and such adjustments could affect the future operations and earnings of the company 
the balanced budget act of expands medicare coverage to seniors with diabetes who do not use insulin 
any delay in the expected july implementation of this legislation would correspondingly delay the anticipated expansion of liberty medical s market 
ability to manage growth the company has expanded its operations rapidly  which has created significant demands on the company s systems  its administrative  operational  development and financial personnel and its other resources 
additional expansion by the company may further strain the company s management  financial and other resources  including its working capital resources  as a result of delays in processing claims for third party reimbursement 
although the company has recently upgraded its systems and other steps have been taken to address these issues  there can be no assurance that such steps will be effective 
direct response advertising in accordance with statement of position  direct response advertising and related costs for all periods presented are capitalized and amortized to selling  general and administrative expense on an accelerated basis during the first two years of a four year period 
the amortization rate is such that of such costs are expensed after two years from the date they are incurred 
revenues generated from new customers as a result of direct response advertising have historically resulted in a revenue stream lasting seven years 
management has selected a more conservative four year amortization period 
management assesses the realizability of the amounts of direct response advertising costs reported as assets at each balance sheet date by comparing the carrying amounts of such assets to the probable remaining future net benefits expected to result directly from such advertising 
the company can expect fluctuations in its advertising costs to attract and retain new customers 
the company expects that it will continue to incur substantial direct response advertising and related costs in connection with the further expansion of its diabetes supplies business 
competition the company is engaged in rapidly evolving and highly competitive fields 
competition from other sellers of diabetes supplies  manufacturers of healthcare products  pharmaceutical companies and other competitors is intense and expected to increase 
many of these companies have substantially greater capital resources  research and development staffs  facilities and experience in marketing and distribution of products than does the company 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not succeed in developing products and services that are more effective than any that are being developed or sold by the company 
the company believes that the principal competitive factors in the healthcare products industry include the ability to identify and respond to customer needs  quality and breadth of service and product offerings  price and technical expertise 
the company believes that its ability to compete also depends in part on a number of competitive factors outside its control  including the ability to hire and retain employees  the development by others of products and services that are competitive with the company s products and services  the price at which others offer comparable products and services and the extent of its competitors responsiveness to customer needs 
dependence on reorders change in demand for diabetes supplies the company generally incurs negative cash flow with respect to the first order for its diabetes supplies from a customer due primarily to customer acquisition costs  including advertising and medicare and secondary insurance compliance costs 
accordingly  the profitability of the company s diabetes supplies business depends on recurring orders 
reorder rates are inherently uncertain and are subject to several factors  many of which are outside of the company s control  including customer shifts to nursing homes or other forms of managed care  customer mortality  changing customer preferences  general economic conditions and customer satisfaction 
furthermore  efforts are underway to improve treatment of  and to seek a cure for  diabetes 
significant developments in either area could substantially reduce or eliminate the demand for the diabetes supplies sold by the company 
dependence on suppliers the company purchases several of its consumer healthcare products  including its thermometers  from suppliers based in the people s republic of china  usually using molds and tooling owned by or committed exclusively to the company 
to date  the company has not experienced difficulties in obtaining timely delivery from these suppliers 
although the company believes there are alternate sources available for these products  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to acquire products from other sources on a timely or cost effective basis in the event current foreign suppliers were unable to supply these products on a timely basis 
although the company has three long term purchase contracts with respect to its diabetes supplies business  it operates principally on a purchase order basis 
each of the company s over the counter products for urinary tract discomfort and urinary tract health is manufactured by a single supplier 
some of the company s professional products also are manufactured by single suppliers 
polymedica is currently taking steps to provide alternate sources of supply for both of these lines of products  but such efforts are not yet complete 
dependence on single manufacturing facility for professional products a majority of the company s professional products is manufactured at its headquarters facility in woburn  massachusetts 
while the company maintains business interruption insurance  any prolonged inability to utilize this facility as a result of fire  natural disaster or other event would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company complies with good manufacturing practices gmp regulations  prescribed by the food and drug administration fda  in its internal manufacturing facilities 
the fda enforces the gmp regulations through its plant inspection program 
if the company fails to comply with gmp regulations  the company could be required to make material expenditures and could experience manufacturing delays to return to compliance 
product liability the testing  manufacturing  marketing and sale of medical and consumer products entail an inherent risk that product liability claims will be asserted against the company or its third party distributors 
certain manufacturers of healthcare products have been subjected to significant claims for damages allegedly resulting from their products 
the company currently maintains product liability insurance coverage which it believes to be adequate for its present purposes  but there can be no assurance that in the future the company will be able to maintain such coverage on acceptable terms or that current insurance or insurance subsequently obtained will provide adequate coverage against any or all potential claims 
reliance on distributors for consumer healthcare and professional products  limited direct marketing experience the company has a limited direct marketing and sales organization  and relies on its current distributors  for the sale of consumer healthcare and professional products 
the company s ability to sell its consumer healthcare and professional products will depend in part on its ability to enter into marketing and distribution agreements with pharmaceutical  medical device  personal care and other distributors in the united states and other countries 
if the company enters into any such agreements  there can be no assurance that the company s third party distributors will be able to market the company s products effectively 
integration of other businesses  products and technologies as part of its growth strategy  the company currently intends to expand through the acquisition of other businesses  products and technologies 
the company regularly reviews such potential acquisitions  some of which may be material 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully acquire any businesses  products or technologies  or that any such acquired businesses  products or technologies will be profitable 
the company does not currently have any commitments or agreements with respect to any such acquisition 
government regulation political  economic and regulatory influences are resulting in fundamental changes in the healthcare industry in the united states 
the company anticipates that congress and state legislatures will continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems and payment methods 
sales of a large portion of the company s products depend to a significant extent on the availability of reimbursement to the company s customers by government and private insurance plans 
any further reduction in the reimbursement provisions currently in effect for the company s diabetes supplies products which are reimbursable under medicare would reduce the company s revenues and earnings 
the processing of third party reimbursements is a labor intensive effort  and delays in processing claims for reimbursement may increase working capital requirements 
final determination of reimbursements are subject to audit by medicare 
medicare audits of the company to date have not resulted in any significant adjustments 
future audits may  however  result in retroactive adjustments for past charges for products and services  and such adjustments could affect the future operations and earnings of the company 
the balanced budget act of expands medicare coverage to seniors with diabetes who do not use insulin 
any delay in the expected july implementation of this legislation would correspondingly delay the anticipated expansion of liberty medical s market 
certain aspects of the company s business are subject to federal and state regulation 
federal regulation covers  among other things  reimbursement for diabetes testing supplies and the manufacturing  distribution and sale of the company s drugs and medical devices 
the company believes that its operations comply with applicable federal and state laws and regulations in all material respects 
however  changes in the law or new interpretations of existing laws could have a material adverse effect on the market for the company s products and services on permissible activities of the company  and the relative costs associated with doing business
