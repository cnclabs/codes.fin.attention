impact of year some of the company s older computer programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  those computer programs have time sensitive software that recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could cause a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has completed an assessment and developed a modification plan to modify its software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the company is also assessing hardware and systems software for year compliance 
the total year project cost is estimated at approximately million  of which an estimated 
million will be capitalized 
to date  the company has incurred and expensed approximately 
million  primarily for assessment of the year issue  the development of a modification plan and the pilot project for code modifications 
the company has initiated formal communications with all of its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the company s interface systems are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
the company s total year project cost and estimates to complete include the estimated costs and time associated with the impact of third party year issues based on presently available information 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted and would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems 
the project is estimated to be completed by june   which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
the company believes that with modifications to existing software the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  the success of third parties modifying their own systems and similar uncertainties 
the company believes it should have no material exposure to contingencies related to the year issue for the products it has sold 
the company s belief is based on the company s practice of giving to its customers only those warranties which the company receives from its suppliers 
to the extent such warranties are breached  liability resulting therefrom will be the ultimate responsibility of the company s suppliers 
however  there can be no guarantee that such suppliers will be able to defend and indemnify the company 
specific factors that might cause the company to incur liability include  but are not limited to  insolvency of its suppliers  the existence of contractual limitations on the suppliers liability  and uncertainties regarding judicial interpretation of the law regarding implied warranties
