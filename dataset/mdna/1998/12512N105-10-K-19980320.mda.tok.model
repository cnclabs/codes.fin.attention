at december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million and working capital of million 
at december  the company had working capital of million 
the increase of million in working capital in was due primarily to the company s cash flow from operations for the year ended december  offset by capital expenditures for facility expansion and other purposes

there is no assurance that the remaining exit liability will be adequate to cover actual costs should the company s actual experience in subleasing the facility differ from the assumptions used in calculating the exit charge 
any additional costs would reduce operating results at the time such costs are known 
the company believes that the funds held in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities combined with funds available under the existing credit facilities and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund the company s working capital and cash requirements  including facilities expansion  at least through december  the company does not anticipate that it will pay any cash dividends during global market risks a portion of the products the company markets either are produced in or have major components produced in the asia pacific region 
while the company does not engage in business relationships with companies located in the region directly  it does engage in us dollar denominated transactions with us divisions and subsidiaries of these companies 
as a result  the company may be indirectly affected by risks associated with international events  including economic and labor conditions  political instability  tariffs and taxes  availability of products and currency fluctuations in the us dollar versus the regional currencies 
countries in the asia pacific region  including japan  have recently experienced weaknesses in their currency  banking and equity markets 
these weaknesses could adversely affect the supply and price of products and components and ultimately  the company s results of operations 
information technology and the year the year issue yk is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
during a recent year yk assessment  the company identified a manageable amount of legacy software that requires modification with the remainder already compliant 
based on this assessment  the company has determined that it will not be required to modify or replace significant portions of its software to make the systems perform properly after december  however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be converted timely  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram and test software applications for yk compliance 
the company plans to complete the yk project by december  to date  the expenses of the yk project have not had a material effect on the results of operations 
moreover  the remaining expenses  which will be incurred through december   are not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company plans to complete the yk modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans  and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
additionally  material differences could be caused by the ability of third parties that interface with the company s systems to make all necessary modifications for year compliance 
certain statements included in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations concerning the company s sales growth  gross profit as a percentage of sales  advertising expense  cooperative advertising reimbursements and exit charge are forward looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties  as specified herein
