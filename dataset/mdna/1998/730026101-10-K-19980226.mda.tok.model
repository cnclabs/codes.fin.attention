item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations compared with sales increased for the seventh consecutive year  as sales at million were up over from levels 
the major contributors to the growth were the october   and january   acquisitions  now operating as brite line technologies  inc  and plymouth rubber europa  sa  respectively  which contributed to of the growth 
plymouth rubber s core business parent company without subsidiaries sales were up over  as capacity restrictions continued to limit production output in the canton manufacturing facility 
in the core business  commitments to providing product to the automotive market resulted in sales increases of over in that market while sales in the non automotive oem market decreased and sales in other markets were flat or down slightly from levels  due primarily to the capacity restrictions 
in february   the company announced a million capital investment program to substantially increase the company s manufacturing capacity  reduce costs and improve productivity 
the largest step in the program  accounting for over half of the planned expenditure  is a new vinyl calender and auxiliary equipment  scheduled to begin production in the second quarter of cost of products sold as a percentage of sales improved to in from in plymouth s core business cost of products sold to customers improved from in to in  as higher volumes and product cost reductions were partially offset by higher plant maintenance expenses and higher indirect labor and training costs  which are being incurred in preparation for the company s planned increase in manufacturing capacity 
in addition  brite line s cost of products sold also contributed to the improved overall percentage 
europa s cost of products sold was 
selling expenses as a percentage of sales were and in and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to the addition of brite line 
selling expenses for in plymouth s core business were slightly higher when compared with levels  as increased outside warehouse costs were somewhat offset by lower advertising  commissions  and freight 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were in as compared to in the consolidation of the brite line and europa subsidiaries was the primary contributor to the increase in general and administrative expenses  although some of brite line s administrative functions were absorbed by the parent company 
plymouth s core business also had increases in employee recruiting  salaries  and k contributions to supplement the company s previously frozen pension plan  offset by lower employee incentive compensation 
interest expense as a percentage of sales increased from in to in or a total increase of  from this increase reflects higher loan volume due primarily to the financing of the two acquisitions  offset in part by reduced interest rates 
other income  net increased from  in to  in  due primarily to the sale of some unused real estate in foreign currency exchange loss increased from  in to  in  resulting from foreign currency denominated sales and from intercompany receivables with the plymouth europa subsidiary  in combination with a strengthening dollar and longer payment terms which are in accordance with local customs 
as a result of the factors described above  income before tax increased from  in to  in the effective tax rate in was of pre tax income compared to a  tax benefit in  due primarily to a reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance 
as a result  net income was  in and  in cash generated from operating activities was  in as compared to  in three major contributors to cash inflows were net income  depreciation and amortization  and a reduction in inventory  which occurred in plymouth s core business work in process and finished goods inventory  offset by inventory increases from the two newly consolidated subsidiaries 
the major operating use of cash was an increase in accounts receivable  which was also due in large part to the additional new subsidiaries 
during  the company used  in proceeds from additional term debt   from its revolving line of credit  and  from the sale lease back of certain new capital equipment to fund the cash portion of the purchase of cintas adhesivas nunez  sa now operating as plymouth rubber europa  sa for  increase its investment in brite line technologies  inc by  purchase  of capital equipment  the largest item being the new vinyl calendering line  and reduce term debt by  the us dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of the company s consolidated operations 
for these operations  all gains and losses from currency transactions are included in income currently 
the cumulative translation effects for equity investments using functional currencies other than the us dollar are included in the cumulative translation adjustments in stockholders equity 
the company operates a wholly owned subsidiary in spain which accounted for approximately of the company s revenues in fiscal the functional currency of this subsidiary is the peseta 
changes in the peseta exchange rate could affect the reporting of the subsidiary s earnings in the consolidated statement of operations 
from time to time  the us company enters into purchase or sales contracts in currencies other than the us dollar 
the company s practice is to hedge those transactions which are of significant size 
the united states environmental protection agency epa has asserted three outstanding claims against the company under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  pursuant to which epa is seeking to recover from the company and other generators the costs associated with the clean up of certain sites used by licensed disposal companies hired by the company as independent contractors for the disposal and or reclamation of hazardous waste materials 
in one case  in respect to the superfund site known as re solve  inc  of dartmouth  massachusetts  the company entered into a consent decree  which required a total payment by the company of  plus interest over a period of five years in full settlement of the epa claim 
the company has now made all payments  including all accrued interest  and has no further payment obligation in this matter 
with respect to the second assertion against the company under cercla  a general notice of potential liability was sent to  potentially responsible parties prp including the company  in june   relative to a superfund site known as solvent recovery service of new england srs at a location in southington  connecticut  concerning shipments to the site which occurred between june   and january  the epa has attributed a share of the aggregate waste volume to the company 
the company believes that this attribution may be overstated by failing to account for the portion of the gross waste volume actually returned to the company 
the first phase of a remediation program is estimated to cost million 
the company is a participant in the performing prp group 
the administrative order on consent for removal action and remedial feasibility study was entered on or about february  phase ii of the clean up and the remedial investigation feasibility study ri fs  is projected to cost million 
the most currently available estimate is that the total cost of the clean up for the prp s will range from approximately million to million 
based on all available information as well as its prior experience  management believes the amount accrued of  which is net of approximately  in total payments made by the company  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of november   is reasonable in relation to the company s attributed share of total estimated aggregate cost 
this amount is subject to adjustment for future developments that may arise from the long range nature of this epa case  legislative changes  insurance coverage  the uncertainties associated with the ultimate outcome of the record of decision rod  the joint and several liability provisions of cercla  and the company s ability to successfully negotiate an outcome similar to its previous experience in these matters 
no actions have been filed by the epa against the company 
therefore  while the company is participating in the prp group  it is impossible to determine the company s total ultimate liability and or responsibility at this time 
on january   the company received a notification of an additional superfund site  old southington landfill  the osl site regarding which the epa asserts that the company is a prp 
the osl site is related to the srs site in that  the epa alleges  after receipt and processing of various hazardous substances from prp s  the owners and or operators of the srs site shipped the resultant contaminated soil from the srs site to the osl site 
since the company is alleged to have shipped materials to the srs site  the epa alleges that the company is also a prp of the osl site 
in addition  there were three direct shippers to the site  the town of southington  general electric  and pratt whitney  as well as other transporters and or users 
based on epa s asserted volume of shipments to srs during that time period  the epa has attributed of waste volume of all srs customers to the company  no attempt has been made by epa to adjust the waste volume for the distillation done by srs prior to shipment to osl 
an rod was issued in september  for the first phase of the clean up 
in a mediated settlement  the transshipper prp s were ultimately assessed a total share of the first phase of the clean up  as well as settlement of past costs including orphan shares  in the amount of million 
subsequent to year end on or about december   the company executed the consent decree and paid  in full settlement of the first phase 
the settlement of the second phase continues to be mediated  though the allocation among the parties and scope of the remedy for the second phase has not been agreed upon  total costs are estimated at between and million 
the company has been notified that parties of which the company is one will likely be precluded from participating in an early mediated settlement for the second phase on a de minimis basis 
therefore  should the company choose to continue to participate in the prp group for the second phase  it is probable its payment to obtain a complete release will be greater than a de minimis parties settlement 
based on all available information as well as its prior experience management believes a reasonable estimate of its liability is  and has accrued this amount in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of november  this amount includes the first phase settlement of  subsequently paid  and is subject to future developments that may arise from the long range nature of this epa case  legislative changes  insurance coverage  the uncertainties associated with the ultimate outcome of the second remedial phase  if any  and the joint and several liability provisions of cercla  and the company s ability to successfully negotiate an outcome similar to its previous experience in these matters 
no actions have been currently filed by the epa against the company 
therefore  while the company intends to vigorously defend this matter  it is impossible to determine the company s total liability and or responsibility at this time 
in addition  in the process of preparing to eliminate the use of certain underground storage tanks located at the company s manufacturing facility  the company determined that some soil contamination had occurred in a small localized area near the tanks in question 
in accordance with massachusetts requirements  the company notified the massachusetts department of environmental protection dep of the foregoing and on or about september   the dep issued a notice of responsibility  rtn no 
 pursuant to mgl c 
e 
according to the preliminary information obtained by an independent licensed site professional lsp  the contamination of the soil appears to be confined to a small area and does not pose an environmental risk to the surrounding property or community 
remediation action is in process 
it is expected that such assessment and remediation will take up to two years to complete and that the remaining costs for same will not exceed the additional sum of  which has been provided for in the accompanying financial statements 
on or about january   the company received a notice of responsibility from the dep pursuant to mgl c 
e concerning the certain sites identified as the ledge  state road  dartmouth rtn no 
 and ridge hill road  freetown rtn no 
the letter indicates that drums containing hazardous materials  some of which may have contained the company s wastes  were discovered at both sites in april  and that response actions were undertaken at both sites between and by the dep 
on information and belief  the company which disposed of these drums is h m drum to whom the company shipped wastes between to the dep has issued at least ten notices to prp s and the company believes additional notices will be sent 
in compliance with dep requests and statutory requirements  the company has hired a lsp to perform certain technical services at the sites 
recent sampling of existing wells at the freetown site contained no finding of any volatile organic chemicals 
sampling at the dartmouth site still remains to be done 
until additional data is gathered  the extent of the problem and remedial action required  if any  cannot be determined 
further  the total number of prp s is not yet known 
accordingly  at the current time  the company is not able to estimate its portion of any liability ultimately arising from this site 
therefore  as of november   no reserves have been provided in the accompanying financial statements 
pursuant to the company s compliance with epa and massachusetts regulations concerning the upgrade or replacement of underground storage tanks by december   the company arranged for the testing of the area adjacent to three underground storage tanks 
a limited amount of solvent was found in the soil in the vicinity of the tanks  however  additional sampling is required 
the company notified the dep of its test results  and on november   the dep issued a written response  notifying the company of its responsibility  rtn no 
 under mgl c 
e as an unclassified site for response and remedial action 
the company has several options under the law to protect  remove or replace the tanks and plans to take whatever remedial action is deemed appropriate 
the company is in the process of determining the costs associated with each of these alternatives and has hired an lsp to perform initial site investigation activities

the automotive and export increases continued to reflect trends toward more complex electrical systems and motor vehicles and toward larger vehicles  especially trucks and utility vehicles

this reduction reflects a increase in gross profit  which was more than offset by a increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the gross profit increase was primarily attributable to higher sales volume  as the increase in manufacturing direct labor and overhead put in place to service the and subsequent year s anticipated volume  offset moderately decreased material costs and volume oriented cost reductions  and resulted in a gross margin  down percentage points from the prior year 
the operating income included a  gain  net of reserves  from the settlement of an insurance claim 
selling expenses increased over  which increased over  to serve both current and expected volume increases in the expanded domestic auto and export markets 
the increased expense reflects moderately higher salaries  fringe benefits  and significantly higher freight and selling expenses to support the export markets 
general administrative expenses  exclusive of a  increase in environmental reserves  a  insurance settlement  and a  recovery from a lawsuit in fiscal  and a  recovery from an insurance settlement in  decreased reflecting increased bad debts and travel expense offset by reduced depreciation  professional fees  and computer equipment rental 
income from continuing operations before taxes of  was down from  in  which benefited from a  insurance settlement 
exclusive of the  settlement in  the  intangible asset amortization  the  environmental charge and the  settlements in  income before taxes was down  from the prior year  as the adjusted operating and other income shortfell the prior year  offset in part by a  reduction in interest expense 
reduced interest expense was attributable to reduced interest rates as a result of a decrease in the prime rate and the replacement of the company s primary lender on june   and basis points on the million term loan refinanced on december  with a new lender 
net income at  was down  from  which included a  recapture of deferred tax valuation allowance  which resulted in a  tax provision 
net income for includes a  benefit from a reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance  which resulted in a tax benefit of  a deferred tax asset and a related valuation allowance was established on december  based on estimates of future taxable income through fiscal during fiscal  the valuation allowance was reduced by  to  based on estimates of future taxable income beyond fiscal the net deferred tax asset as of november  was  see note to consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  cash from operating activities was  as compared to  for  as cash provided by net income  exclusive of the deferred income tax benefit  amortization of the intangible asset  and the increased environmental reserves  totaling  depreciation  and the reduction of prepaid expenses  exceeded the outflow used to expand inventory  expand accounts receivable  and to reduce accounts payable  other liabilities and pension obligations 
in accordance with the company s agreement with its primary lender  all cash receipts were applied against the revolving loan 
cash provided by operations  the  proceeds from the term debt refinancing  and the increase in the revolving line of credit generated by the june  refinancing  was used to finance  of net additions to plant and equipment  and to repay debt and reduce capital lease obligations 
on october   lb acquisition corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  acquired certain assets of brite line industries  inc out of foreclosure from brite line s senior secured creditors for a cost of  plus a  guarantee of brite line industries accounts receivable 
lb acquisition corporation was renamed brite line technologies  inc  which produces and markets rubber based highway marking tapes from its denver  colorado facility 
included in the purchased assets are inventories  machinery and equipment  and intangibles including patents  trademarks  trade names  and state municipal product approvals 
the total purchase price of  inclusive of the accounts receivable guarantee shortfall  the  cash payment  and acquisition costs  has been recorded on the acquiring company s balance sheet as inventory valued at  plus fixed assets valued at  liquidity and capital resources during  plymouth rubber initiated a million capital expansion program  including a new calender and associated equipment  which will substantially increase its vinyl tape production capacity 
at the end of fiscal and the beginning of fiscal  the company also invested in new subsidiaries brite line technologies  inc  and plymouth rubber europa  sa  which it considers to be strategic opportunities 
in connection with these investments  the company has increased its debt from approximately of total capitalization in to approximately in in addition  the inefficiencies of operating under capacity constraints have put some pressure on operating margins 
despite these considerations  the company was in compliance with all of its financial covenants as of november  during  however  several of these covenants will become more restrictive 
based upon current projections  the company may not meet certain of these covenants during with respect to this  management is currently negotiating with the applicable lender to revise these covenants 
should less restrictive financial covenants not be negotiated prior to the end of the first quarter of  a portion of the company s long term debt may be classified on its balance sheet as current at that time 
at november   long term debt subject to such potential reclassification was approximately  as of november   because of collateral limitations and after consideration of the letter of credit related to a final payment on the purchase of the new vinyl calender and auxiliary equipment and to a guarantee of  pesetas approximately  on a term loan agreement with a spanish bank syndicate  the company had approximately  of unused borrowing capacity  under its million line of credit with its primary lender 
in the opinion of management  anticipated cash flow from operations  unused capacity under existing borrowing agreements  and additional funds generated from one or more of the following anticipated financing arrangements i the sale and leaseback of capital equipment  ii refinancing of certain existing capital equipment  and iii a capital expenditure line of credit  will provide sufficient funds to meet expected needs during fiscal  including necessary working capital expansion to support anticipated revenue growth  investments in capital equipment and to service its indebtedness 
although management expects to be able to accomplish its plans  there is no assurance that it will be able to do so 
failure to accomplish these plans could have an adverse impact on the company s liquidity and financial position
