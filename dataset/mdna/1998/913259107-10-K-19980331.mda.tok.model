fuel and purchased power revenues are collected from customers through periodic cost recovery adjustment mechanisms 
changes in this component of operating revenue do not affect net income as they normally mirror corresponding changes in fuel and purchased power costs 
conservation and load management program revenue is also collected from customers through periodic cost recovery mechanisms  reflecting underlying changes in conservation and load management program costs 
electric base revenue is that portion of electric operating revenue that has a direct impact on net income 
in  electric base revenue decreased by approximately million when compared to this decrease in electric base revenue was primarily due to lower overall sales volume 
electric base revenue increased by approximately million  or  when compared to gas operating revenue amounted to approximately of unitil s total operating revenues and decreased by million  or  in compared to gas operating revenue is comprised of three components cost of gas revenue  interruptible revenue and firm gas base revenue 
cost of gas revenue  including interruptible revenue  is collected from customers through the operation of a cost of gas adjustment mechanism 
changes in this component of gas operating revenue does not affect net income as it tracks corresponding changes in gas supply costs 
interruptible revenue decreased by million in compared to this decrease is the result of lower therm sales and lower margins in as the wholesale price of natural gas approached the price of oil 
margins earned on interruptible gas sales are used to directly lower rates to firm gas customers through the cost of gas adjustment mechanism 
firm base gas revenue is that portion of gas operating revenue that has a direct impact on net income 
in  firm base gas revenue decreased million compared to due to lower sales volume 
firm base gas revenue increased million  or  compared to other revenue declined from  in to  in the decrease in other revenue from  in is the result of the termination of a service agreement between unitil resources  inc and a principal customer 
operating expenses fuel and purchased power expense is the cost of fuel used in electric generation and wholesale energy and capacity purchased to meet the unitil system s electric energy requirements 
fuel and purchased power expenses normally recoverable from customers through periodic cost recovery adjustment mechanisms decreased million  or in compared to the change reflects a decrease in the system s total energy requirements in the combined power supply portfolio of the unitil system is comprised of a variety of resources 
for  the portfolio was comprised of owned generation  purchased power from utilities  and purchased power from non utility generators 
gas purchased for resale reflects gas purchased and made to supply the system s total gas energy requirements 
purchased gas is recoverable from customers through the cost of gas adjustment mechanism 
purchased gas costs decreased by approximately million or in as compared to  reflecting a decrease in therms purchased in and higher wholesale gas prices in gas purchased for resale increased by million  or in the year period from to  based on higher wholesale prices and an increase in therms purchased 
under order  the federal energy regulatory commission ferc has allowed gas pipeline suppliers to recover prudently incurred cost resulting from the transition into a deregulated environment 
the company s combination gas and electric utility operating subsidiary has been incurring ferc approved transition charges from its natural gas pipeline supplier since through the end of  the amount of transition costs incurred by the company totaled approximately million 
these costs are being recovered directly from gas customers through the cost of gas adjustment mechanism 
on the basis of estimates included in rate filings before the ferc and other publicly available information  the company currently estimates that it may incur up to an additional million of transition costs in future years 
the company expects full recovery of these costs through billings to customers 
operation and maintenance expense  which includes distribution operating costs  conservation and load management program expenditures and the company s share of operating costs related to power production at the generation facilities in which the company has a partial ownership interest  decreased by approximately million  or in compared to the decrease reflects lower distribution operating expenses partially offset by the higher production related operating costs and an increase in expenses for the company s restructuring activities and new business initiatives 
in  operation and maintenance expense increased over by approximately million  or  primarily due to expenses in in support of the company s utility operations  regulatory activities  and new business initiatives 
depreciation  amortization and taxes depreciation expense increased million  or  for over the prior year due to a higher level of plant in service 
amortization of the cost of abandoned properties relates to the abandonment of an investment in the seabrook nuclear power plant by the company s massachusetts retail operating subsidiary 
a portion of the former investment in this project is being recovered in rates to electric customers as allowed by the massachusetts department of telecommunications and energy formerly known as the massachusetts department of public utilities 
federal and state income taxes decreased in compared to by million 
this result reflects lower net income before taxes in local property and other taxes increased million  or  in this increase mainly reflects the annual property tax increases set by local communities 
non operating income expenses non operating income expenses in represent expenses of approximately million including expenditures related to the company s community emergency preparedness grant programs 
in non operating income of million reflects the one time gain on the sale of the company s former corporate headquarters 
interest expense interest expense  net increased in over  due to increases in interest rates and long term borrowings 
long term debt increased as a result of the construction financing of the company s new corporate headquarters 
capital requirements and liquidity the unitil system requires capital for the acquisition of property  plant and equipment in order to improve  protect  maintain and expand its electric and gas distribution systems  to develop and market new energy related products and services and to improve customer service operations and capabilities 
the capital necessary to meet these requirements is derived primarily from the company s retained earnings and through the sale of shares of common stock through the company s dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plans 
when internally generated funds are not available  it is the company s policy to borrow funds on a short term basis to meet the capital requirements of its subsidiaries and  when necessary  to repay short term debt through the sale and issuance of permanent financing 
cash flows from operating activities increased by million in after decreasing by million in in  compared to  million of the increase in operating cash flow was the result of a decrease in the timing difference undercollection between the payment on fuel  purchased power and purchased gas costs and the corresponding recovery of these costs in revenue billed under periodic cost recovery mechanisms 
the balance of the increase reflects other changes in the company s working capital requirements as detailed in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
operating activities s net cash provided by operating activities    cash flows from investing activities decreased approximately million in compared to  reflecting spending  in  for the construction of the company s new corporate headquarters

regulatory matters competition and restructuring regulatory activity in both massachusetts and new hampshire has focused on the restructuring of the electric industry and the process of deregulating the retail sale of electric energy 
march  was the retail access date for massachusetts consumers  while july  is targeted as choice date for new hampshire consumers 
under these restructuring proposals  electricity consumers would be allowed to choose their supplier of electricity from the competitive market  and have their local utility deliver that electricity over its distribution system at regulated rates 
in massachusetts  regulators  gas utilities and other stakeholders have also begun a collaborative effort to develop solutions to the many issues that surround restructuring the local natural gas distribution business 
the massachusetts department of telecommunications and energy formerly known as the department of public utilities  hereinafter referred to as the mdte issued a directive to all gas distribution companies to file unbundled rates to be effective november   the first step in a multi year phase in of a restructured natural gas industry in massachusetts 
unitil has been preparing for the electric industry restructuring by developing transition plans that will move its utility subsidiaries into this new market structure in a way that will ensure fairness in the treatment of the company s assets and obligations that are dedicated to the current regulated franchises and  at the same time  provide choice for all customers 
simultaneous with this transition process for unitil s regulated utilities  the company is moving to position its competitive market subsidiary  unitil resources  inc  to pursue growth areas both within and beyond the company s traditional franchises in the emerging  competitive electric energy market 
unitil also has been participating in the natural gas collaborative process and is preparing a transition plan to be filed with the mdte in the second quarter of massachusetts electric in november  the massachusetts legislature enacted restructuring legislation the act that  in early december  was signed into law by governor cellucci 
the act required all electric utilities that did not have a restructuring plan on file with the mdte to file a plan by december   and set march  as the date that competition would start for all massachusetts electricity consumers  the retail access date 
the act required utilities to provide a an estimate and detailed accounting of its total transition costs eligible for recovery  b a description of its strategies to mitigate its transition costs  c unbundled prices for distribution  transmission  generation and other services  d proposed charges for recovery of transition costs  e proposed programs for universal service for all customers  f proposed programs and recovery mechanisms to promote energy conservation and demand side management  g procedures for ensuring direct retail access to all generation suppliers  and h discussions of the impact of the plan on the company s employees and the communities served by the company 
in addition  the act required all massachusetts utilities to reduce their rates to all consumers by  effective march  unitil s massachusetts operating subsidiary  fitchburg gas and electric light company fg e  filed its restructuring plan the plan with the mdte on december  the plan  which substantially complies with the act  was conditionally approved by the mdte in february  and will be the subject of an mdte investigation  including evidentiary hearings to be held in mid march  which will result in final mdte approval in the second quarter of as part of the plan  fg e has agreed to divest itself of all power supply assets and contracts 
the company has developed and started to implement its divestiture plan with a goal of completing divestiture by year end divestiture will place an actual market value on these assets thereby enabling the company to recover all above market or transition or stranded  costs via a non bypassable transition charge approved by the mdte 
the company included its estimate and a detailed accounting of those costs and a description of its strategies to mitigate them 
the plan also provides its customers with choice of supplier on march   unbundled rates ie  rates separated into distribution  transmission  generation and transition components  and a percent discount effective march  to be followed by an additional percent discount when divestiture is completed 
to ensure universal service so that all consumers may receive electric service  the plan provides for offering standard offer service  default service and open access to transmission facilities 
fg e s plan includes a substantial commitment to our environment increasing the company s annual expenditures on energy efficiency programs and providing funding for a state run renewable resources program 
finally  the plan includes a discussion as to why there will be no adverse impacts on the company s employees or the communities we serve 
standard offer service will be offered to consumers who choose not to choose a competitive supplier for up to seven years  from supplies secured by fg e from the market at no profit to fg e 
the purpose of this service is to provide consumers with a fixed price power supply against which they can measure competitive offers before they are ready to enter the competitive market 
default service will be offered to all consumers who for whatever reason do not receive their power supply from their chosen supplier 
this service will be offered at market rates  at no profit to the fg e 
open access guarantees all consumers access to competitive power supplies from any registered supplier  once the supplier delivers the power to the new england transmission grid now controlled by an independent system operator 
massachusetts gas in july  the mdte directed all massachusetts gas local distribution companies ldcs to form a collaborative with other stakeholders to develop common principles and appropriate regulations by which unbundling by all ldcs might proceed 
on september  the massachusetts gas unbundling collaborative had its first meeting 
since that time  a great deal of effort has been expended toward achieving the mdte s stated goal 
however  a great deal more work needs to be done before the principles and regulations are completed and presented to the mdte for its review 
on august  the mdte further directed fg e and four other ldcs to file unbundled gas rates for its review to become effective november  the company is currently engaged in carrying out this directive and plans to file its unbundled rates by april  unlike the electric industry restructuring which will provide all customers with choice of suppliers at the same time  gas industry restructuring appears to be heading towards a multi year phase in of choice of gas supplier starting november  new hampshire in new hampshire  house bill now known as rsa f was signed into law by the governor in may  rsa f establishes principles  standards and a timetable for the new hampshire public utilities commission nhpuc to implement full  open retail electric competition as early as january   but no later than july  the law also directs the nhpuc to set interim access charges for the recovery of above market stranded power supply costs and to make a final determination on these access charges within two years of implementation of full competition 
as required by rsa f  the nhpuc set a procedural schedule for opening up the state to retail competition 
after months of hearings  the nhpuc issued its plan on february  a requiring all new hampshire utilities to file restructuring plans for its consideration  b providing for full recovery of stranded costs by those utilities whose rates were below the new england average this includes both of unitil s new hampshire retail operating subsidiaries and partial recovery of stranded costs by those utilities with rates above the new england average  c requiring all utilities to file unbundled rates and interim stranded cost recovery charges  and d prohibiting marketing affiliates of new hampshire utilities from selling energy on a competitive basis in their service territories and imposing other constraints on their ability to sell energy anywhere in new hampshire 
in april   all of the new hampshire utilities and several other parties filed for rehearing on many issues resulting from the nhpuc s plan 
in addition  the public service company of new hampshire psnh filed suit in federal court seeking to overturn several of the requirements of the nhpuc s plan 
unitil and all of the other new hampshire electric utilities subsequently intervened in the psnh federal court appeal as party plaintiffs 
ninety days of mediation between psnh and some of the parties failed to arrive at an acceptable solution and the mediation effort was terminated on september  in september   new hampshire governor shaheen filed a plan with the nhpuc  designed to put aside all contentious issues  make the federal court suit moot and set the framework for bringing competition to the granite state by july  several key members of the new hampshire legislature supported the governors proposal 
in addition  the nhpuc began the rehearing process  but limited its efforts to the issues that psnh took to federal court 
several companies  including the unitil companies  have begun negotiations with various stakeholders to reach resolution of the many issues left unresolved by the nhpuc in an attempt to revive the process and bring about competition by july  one new hampshire utility has reached settlement with some of the parties and filed that settlement with the nhpuc for its approval 
the unitil companies have reached an agreement in principle with several parties and are proceeding to negotiate a detailed settlement to be filed with the nhpuc that could bring about competition by july the unitil proposed settlement plan would provide unitil s retail electric distribution consumers with access to the retail energy supply market in new hampshire 
under this plan  all of the company s new hampshire customers will continue to enjoy unitil s very competitive electric rates among the lowest in new england and also will benefit from market competition and the resulting innovation and energy savings 
unitil s settlement plan guarantees all its customers competitive retail delivery prices  open and nondiscriminatory access to competitive electricity suppliers  reliable electric service and comprehensive consumer protection standards 
the company s settlement plan achieves these benefits and safeguards for consumers  while providing for full recovery of unitil s obligations that were undertaken to serve customers in the company s new hampshire franchises  and while providing a sensible framework enabling its marketing affiliate to compete anywhere in new hampshire and ensuring full and fair competition among all competitive suppliers 
nh pilot program in june  the new hampshire retail competition pilot program pilot program  mandated by legislation enacted a year earlier  became operational 
during the two year term of the pilot program  up to or some  new hampshire electric consumers are allowed to choose from competing electric suppliers  and have this supply delivered across the local utility system 
the company s subsidiary  unitil resources  inc  began competitive marketing efforts in may  and began making sales in june  the pilot program is expected to conclude for the unitil companies on june  rate cases the last comprehensive regulatory proceedings to increase base rates for unitil s three retail operating subsidiaries occurred in for concord electric company  for fitchburg gas and electric light company and for exeter hampton electric company 
a majority of the system s operating revenues are collected under various periodic rate adjustment mechanisms including fuel  purchased power  cost of gas and energy efficiency program cost recovery mechanisms 
restructuring will change the methods of how certain costs are recovered from customers and from suppliers 
transition costs aka stranded costs  standard offer service and default service power supply costs  internal and external transmission service costs and energy efficiency and renewable energy program costs are expected to be recovered via fully reconciling rate adjustment mechanisms 
millstone unit no 
unitil s massachusetts operating subsidiary  fitchburg gas and electric light company  has a ownership mw in the millstone unit no 
millstone nuclear generating unit 
millstone has been out of service since march  and has been classified as a category facility by the nuclear regulatory commission nrc since june  the nrc assigns this rating to plants which it deems to have significant weaknesses that warrant maintaining the plant in shutdown condition until the operator demonstrates that adequate programs have been established and implemented to ensure substantial improvement in the operation of the plant 
millstone must receive restart authorization by a vote of the nrc commissioners prior to resuming power operation 
the company can only project when millstone may be authorized by the nrc to restart  but forecasts the unit s restart in mid during the period that millstone remains out of service  fg e will continue to incur its proportionate share of the unit s ongoing operations and maintenance o m costs  and may incur additional o m costs and capital expenditures to meet nrc requirements 
fg e will also incur costs to replace the power that was expected to be generated by the unit 
in august  the company  in concert with other nonoperating joint owners  filed a demand for arbitration in connecticut and a lawsuit in massachusetts  in an effort to recover costs associated with the extended unplanned shutdown and the associated costs 
the arbitration and legal cases are actively proceeding 
environmental issues in  fitchburg gas and electric light company completed the majority of work at two former manufactured gas plant mgp sites under the requirements of the massachusetts contingency plan mcp 
in july  the logan street mgp site in gardner achieved permanent closure and was closed out with the mcp 
this was accomplished by capping the site so that exposure to soils was eliminated  and also by placing an activities and use limitation on the deed for this site 
this limitation informs future buyers of the potential hazards at the site 
in december  the company submitted a phase iii report that provides for temporary closure for the majority of the sawyer passway mgp site 
this temporary closure allows the company to monitor the site every five years to determine if a more feasible remediation alternative has been developed 
there is a portion of the sawyer passway mgp site which still remains open under the mcp rule  but it is expected that this portion will be closed out in the costs of remedial action at these sites is initially funded from traditional sources of capital and recovered from customers under a rate recovery mechanism approved by the mdte 
the company also has a number of liability insurance policies that may provide coverage for environmental remediation at these sites 
year the company has conducted a preliminary evaluation of the company s computer systems to determine if the software that the company currently uses is year compliant 
certain of the software applications currently in use by the company are certified to be year compliant by the software vendors from whom the applications were purchased 
certain other software applications currently in use by the company are not year compliant 
the company has made plans to replace or upgrade those applications which are not year compliant before january  the company is conducting surveys and compiling cost estimates of the effort involved to perform those replacements and upgrades 
currently  management believes the cost to bring all of its software applications into year compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  and involves a capital outlay of approximately million to million
