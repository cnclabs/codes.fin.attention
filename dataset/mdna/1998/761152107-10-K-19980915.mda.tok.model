recent accounting developments in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  reporting comprehensive income and sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  both effective for years beginning after december  sfas will require companies to report comprehensive income and sfas will require companies to report segment performance as it is used internally 
these statements impose additional disclosure requirements 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  was issued by the financial accounting standards board in june and is effective for the company s quarter ending september  sfas standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts 
under the standard  entities are required to carry all derivative instruments in the statement of financial position at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value ie  gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and  if so  on the reason for holding it 
if certain conditions are met  entities may elect to designate a derivative instrument as a hedge of exposures to changes in fair values  cash flows  or foreign currencies 
if the hedged exposure is a fair value exposure  the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged 
if the hedged exposure is a cash flow exposure  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported initially as a component of other comprehensive income outside earnings and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
any amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness as well as the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately 
accounting for foreign currency hedges is similar to the accounting for fair value and cash flow hedges 
if the derivative instrument is not designated as a hedge  the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change 
the company has not determined the impact that statement will have on its financial statements and believes that such determination will not be meaningful until closer to the date of initial adoption 
year the company conducted a strategic review of its information systems in fiscal with a view to upgrading operations to facilitate the growth in business activity 
as a consequence of these review procedures a decision was made to replace existing internal systems with the oracle applications enterprise package 
the decision to replace the company s existing information systems was driven by operational requirements although as a consequence all information systems are expected to be fully year compliant 
while management expects the costs associated with year compliance to be approximately  the cost of implementing the oracle application enterprise package is estimated to be  in addition  the company has commenced a review of its product lines to identify any products or systems with embedded technology which may not be year compliant 
to date  this review has not revealed any significant year exposure with regards to the company s products 
the company is also conducting a review of the year compliance of its vendors and customers and any year associated issues with respect to any customer or supplier interface systems 
in addition  the company is currently analyzing all other computer related systems and equipment to ensure year compliance 
this review is expected to be completed during fiscal as part of the construction of the company s new australian manufacturing facility 
beyond the above review procedures  the company is in the process of  and has developed  a number of year contingency plans should a year compliance issue arise 
however  there can be no assurance that customers  suppliers and service providers on which the company relies will resolve their year issues accurately  thoroughly and on schedule 
failure to complete the year project by year could have a material adverse effect on future operating results or financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources as of june  and june   the company had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale of approximately million and million  respectively 
the company s working capital approximated million and million  respectively  at june  and the decline in working capital balances primarily reflects funds used for construction of the company s new manufacturing facility 
beyond this expenditure  working capital balances increased due to increases in trade receivables and inventories partially offset by increases in accrued expenses and income taxes payable 
the company has financed its operations and capital expenditures through cash generated from operations and  to a much lesser extent  through sales of common stock 
during the fiscal years ended june  and  the company s operations generated cash of approximately million and million  respectively  primarily as a result of continued increases in net revenues  offset in part by increases in accounts receivable  inventory and prepayments

during fiscal and  approximately million and  of cash was received upon exercise of common stock options

the company has a substantial exposure to fluctuations in the australian dollar with respect to its manufacturing and research activities which is managed through foreign currency option contracts 
in august  the company commenced construction of its new australian production facility 
this development is anticipated to be completed by early calendar and is expected to be financed through either company cash reserves or by a sale and leaseback transaction 
the company anticipates spending approximately million for the construction of its new manufacturing facility and computer systems over the next twelve months 
these payments are to be funded through cash flows from operations and existing cash resources

foreign currency market risk the company s functional currency is the us dollar although the company transacts business in various foreign currencies including a number of major european currencies as well as the australian dollar 
the company has significant foreign currency exposure through both its australian manufacturing activities and international sales operations 
the company has established a foreign currency hedging program using foreign currency forward exchange contracts and purchased currency options to hedge foreign currency denominated financial assets  liabilities and manufacturing expenditure 
the goal of this hedging program is to economically guarantee or lock in the exchange rates on the company s foreign currency exposures denominated in the deutschmark and australian dollar 
under this program  increases or decreases in the company s foreign currency denominated financial assets  liabilities  and firm commitments are partially offset by gains and losses on the hedging instruments 
based on recent volatility in the far east foreign currency markets  the company has temporarily suspended purchasing of foreign currency forward exchange contracts for its united states dollar  australian dollar exposure 
the company does not use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or purchased currency options for trading purposes the table below provides information about the company s foreign currency derivative financial instruments  by functional currency and presents such information in us dollar equivalents 
the table summarizes information on instruments and transactions that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates  including foreign currency forward exchange agreements and foreign currency call options held at june  for both foreign currency forward exchange agreements and foreign currency call options  the table presents the notional amounts and weighted average exchange rates by expected contractual maturity dates 
these notional amounts generally are used to calculate payments to be exchanged under the contract or options

there are a variety of factors that could cause the company s actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the company s forward looking statements 
the risks and uncertainties that may affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations include the following the market for products designed to treat sleep disordered breathing related respiratory conditions is characterized by frequent product improvements and evolving technology 
the development of new or innovative products by others or the discovery of alternative treatments for such conditions could result in the company s products becoming obsolete or noncompetitive  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the market for the company s products is also highly competitive 
the failure of the company to meet the prices offered by its competitors  or offer products which either contain features similar to or more desirable than those products offered by its competitors or which are perceived as reliable by consumers could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations of the company 
most of the company s competitors have greater financial  research  manufacturing and marketing resources than the company 
in addition  some of the company s competitors sell additional lines of products  and therefore can bundle products to offer higher discounts  or offer rebates or other incentive programs to gain a competitive advantage 
the company s competitors may also employ litigation to gain a competitive advantage 
the company s inability to compete effectively against existing or future competitors would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s operating results have  from time to time  fluctuated on a quarterly basis and may be subject to similar fluctuations in the future 
these fluctuations may result from the absence of a backlog of orders for the company s products  the introduction of new products by the company or its competitors  the geographic mix of product sales  the success of the company s marketing efforts in new regions  changes in third party reimbursement  timing of regulatory action  timing of order by distributors  expenditures incurred for research and development  competitive pricing in different regions  seasonality  the cost and effect of promotional and marketing programs and the effect of foreign currency transaction gains or losses  among other factors  in addition  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws in the various countries in which the company conducts its operations 
the company s success is dependent upon the ability of the company s customers to obtain adequate reimbursement from third party payors for purchasing the company s products 
third party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that the prescribed device has not received appropriate united states food and drug administration fda or other governmental regulatory clearances  is not used in accordance with cost effective treatment methods as determined by the payor  or is experimental  unnecessary or inappropriate 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
the cost containment measures that health care providers are instituting could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to sell its products and may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in some markets  such as spain  france and germany  government reimbursement is currently available for purchase of rental of the company s products  subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations 
in australia and some other foreign markets there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat sleep disordered breathing related respiratory conditions 
a substantial portion of the company s net revenue is generated from sales outside north america 
the company expects that such sales will continue to account for a significant portion of the company s net revenues in the future 
the company s sales outside of north america are subject to certain inherent risks of global operations  including fluctuations in currency exchange rate  tariffs  import licenses  trade policies  domestic and foreign tax policies and foreign medical device manufacturing regulations 
the company has had foreign currency transaction gains and losses in recent periods 
a significant fall in the value of the united states dollar against certain international currencies could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
other factors which could potentially have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial conditions include the costs and other effects of legal and administrative cases and proceedings  settlements and investigations  claims and changes in those items  and developments or assertions by or against the company relating to intellectual property rights and intellectual property licenses
