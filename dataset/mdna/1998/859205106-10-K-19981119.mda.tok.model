the company maintains a credit agreement  which provides for a domestic borrowing capacity of  and an additional  international borrowing capacity 
an underlying letter of credit facility provides for letters of credit up to the full domestic borrowing capacity 
the credit agreement  with final maturity of october   is unsecured and contains various restrictive covenants including limitations on additional borrowings  payment of cash dividends and acquisitions 
the credit agreement also requires that the company maintain certain financial ratios 
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at the higher of the lender s prime rate  the federal funds effective rate plus one half percent or  for borrowings obtained for fixed periods of time  libor plus one half percent 
there were no amounts borrowed or outstanding under the credit agreement  nor the underlying letter of credit facility  as of september  on february   the company issued and sold  shares of common stock in the follow on offering for net proceeds of  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the follow on offering expenses 
at september   the company s capital resource commitments consisted primarily of commitments under lease arrangements for office space and equipment 
the company intends to meet such obligations from cash flows from operations 
although no significant commitments exist for future capital expenditures  the company has presently budgeted capital expenditures of approximately  for fiscal of which approximately  is expected to consist of amounts capitalized pursuant to fas 
the company believes available balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments combined with cash flows from operations and amounts available under the credit agreement are sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
effects of inflation demand for many of the company s products and services tends to improve with increased inflation as customers strive to increase employee productivity and reduce costs 
however  the effect of inflation on the company s relatively labor intensive cost structure could adversely affect its results of operations to the extent the company is not able to recover increased operating costs through increased prices and sales 
year general the year issue is the result of computer programs that were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
accordingly  computer programs that perform date related functions may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculation causing disruptions of operations  including a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
the following discussion regarding year matters constitutes a year readiness disclosure within the meaning of the year information and readiness disclosure act 
the company has been and continues to assess and resolve year issues associated with its product and services offerings  material internal systems  such as information technology it systems and non it systems  and material third party relationships 
the company believes that this program will be completed prior to december  product and services offerings the company has completed a year assessment of its currently offered products and services 
this assessment included internal testing of the year capabilities of the company s product and ec services offerings 
the company has no plans to have its products or ec services tested by an independent source 
based on this assessment  the company believes that the vast majority of its currently offered products and ec services are year compliant  or will become compliant by early through new product releases or modifications to internal systems 
the increased amount of testing related to the year resulted in some delays in the release of new products or product versions 
however  because year compliance is generally integrated into its normal product development activities  the company has not incurred  and does not expect to incur  any significant incremental expenses in addressing the year issue in its product or ec services offerings 
the company believes that a small percentage of its customers who receive product support from the company are operating product versions that may not be year compliant or products or product versions that the company has replaced or intends to replace with comparable year compliant products 
the company believes that the majority of these customers are migrating and will continue to migrate to year compliant versions and products through new releases  which the company is strongly encouraging 
in addition  certain customers may be operating non compliant versions of products in respect of which the company s agreed upon product support and warranty periods have expired 
the company has not undertaken an assessment of whether these customers are taking appropriate steps to address any related year issues 
the company provides a significant amount of its ec services through its data center located in columbus  ohio 
the data center utilizes third party software and hardware  as well as some company software 
furthermore  the data center requires electricity and other utilities and relies on the internet and third party communications providers for the transmission of data to and from its customers 
the company has made provision for back up systems and established contingency plans 
the company has also conducted extensive assessment and testing of the data center  including operating a back up system in a post year mode  and has taken appropriate remedial actions  all in an effort to avoid year failures 
see risk factors dependence on data center below 
the company does not believe that customers who license or migrate to year compliant versions of its products  or customers who purchase the company s ec services  will experience any year failures caused by such products or services 
in addition  the company believes that its licenses and other agreements contain customary and appropriate limitations on the company s obligations with respect to any year failures that may be caused by its current or former products and ec services 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s expectations and beliefs as to these matters will prove to be accurate 
moreover  the company s products are used in  and the provision of its services requires the use of  systems comprised of third party hardware and software  some of which may not be year compliant 
internal systems the company has been conducting a year assessment of its material internal systems  both it and non it  on a risk priority basis 
that assessment  which includes an assessment of certain embedded systems  is nearing completion 
based on the current results of that assessment  the company believes that its internal systems will require minimal remediation  some of which has already been completed or is currently underway 
as a result of the company s decentralized operating structure  non compliant systems tend to be more limited in their effect and easier to remediate 
the vast majority of the remediation required for such systems is expected to be completed by mid  with remediation of the remaining systems scheduled for completion prior to december  based upon the low number of material internal systems expected to require remediation  the company does not anticipate that the internal and external costs of such remediation will have a material adverse effect on the company 
there can be no assurance that the remediation of the company s material internal systems will be completed in a timely manner or that such remediated systems will function as anticipated 
interruption of normal business operations  including the company s ability to effectively provide ec services to customers  in such events could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
third party relationships the company has been conducting a year assessment of its material third party supplier relationships 
the assessment is being conducted through communications with such suppliers  testing of supplier equipment  systems or interfaces  and a review of the year information made publicly available by such suppliers 
the company plans to complete the assessment of its material third party relationships prior to the end of calendar and  promptly upon discovery of any material  non compliant equipment or systems  to begin remediation or adequate remediation assurances from third parties 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will receive all information necessary to fully evaluate the year readiness of all material suppliers 
moreover  the company relies in various ways  both domestically and internationally  on government  utility and communications service providers to conduct normal business operations 
there can be no assurance that such suppliers will not suffer business interruptions caused by a year issue 
such interruptions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
additional risks additional aspects of the year issue may pose risks to be considered in evaluating the future growth of the company 
some commentators predict that normal purchasing patterns and trends in the software industry may be affected by customers replacing or upgrading applications or systems to address year issues 
the company has not experienced any discernable trend indicating a recent or impending material reduction in demand for the company s products and services 
however  there can be no assurance that year issues will not affect future customer purchasing patterns possibly resulting in lower demand for the company s products and services 
furthermore  some commentators have also predicted that a significant amount of litigation may arise out of year compliance issues 
while the company has not been subject to any year claims or lawsuits to date  there can be no assurance that customers or former customers will not bring claims or lawsuits against the company seeking compensation for losses associated with year related failures 
a material adverse outcome in a year claim or lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
contingency planning although the company believes that it is currently executing a timely  effective plan for addressing material year issues that may affect the company  there can be no assurance that the company or a third party on which the company significantly relies will not experience unanticipated consequences or material expenses which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
the company believes that it is difficult to specifically describe its most likely worst case year scenario 
one worst case scenario is the failure of the company s products to correctly perform date related functions through the year  causing customer systems or operations dependent upon such products or services to fail or be disrupted 
other worst case scenarios involve the company s ec services offerings 
failure of the company s internal systems to correctly perform date related functions through the year  or disruptions in those systems  could result in errors or delays in the provision of the company s ec services 
another worst case year scenario is the failure of a material third party supplier  such as a communications or utility provider  to address its year issues  resulting in errors or delays in the provision of the company s ec services 
in the event of such failures or disruptions  customers may commence legal action against the company or otherwise seek compensation for their losses 
except as described above  the company has not established contingency plans to address potential consequences of the year issue 
however  the company intends to continue to evaluate both existing and newly identified year risks and to develop and implement such further responsive measures as it deems appropriate 
new european currency eleven of the member countries of the european union are scheduled to establish fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and a new currency the euro and to adopt the euro as their common legal currency effective january  the company is currently reviewing its products and business operations with respect to the euro s requirements in order to determine pricing strategies in the new economic environment  analyze the legal and contractual implications for contracts  evaluate system capabilities and ensure vendors can support the company s operations with respect to euro transactions 
because its currently offered products and services are currency neutral  the company does not expect to have to modify its products or internal systems used in the provision of services in order to support euro transactions 
the company does expect to modify its business operations  however  in order to support euro transactions  but does not believe that the cost of such modifications will have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial conditions 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to complete such modifications to comply with euro requirements or that any failure to complete such modifications would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial conditions 
in addition  the company faces risks to the extent that third party suppliers upon which the company relies  or their suppliers  are unable to make appropriate modifications to support euro transactions

competition the electronic commerce market is very competitive 
numerous companies supply electronic commerce products and services  and several competitors target specific customer requirements for which the company presently is  or may become  a provider 
the company s competitors include both large companies with substantially greater resources than the company and small  specialized companies that may compete in one or more particular market niches 
competitors that offer products and or services that compete with various of the company s products and services include  among others  at t  computer associates international  inc  general electric information services  harbinger corporation  ibm  mci worldcom  and quick response services  as well as the internal programming staffs of various businesses engaging in electronic commerce 
the company expects competition to increase in the future from both existing competitors and other companies that may enter the company s existing or future markets 
the company believes that its ability to compete successfully in the electronic commerce market depends on numerous factors  some of which are outside its control  including product performance  functionality and reliability  price and customer service and support 
there can be no assurance that new or established competitors will not offer products and services that are superior to and or lower in price than those of the company 
in addition  the company could face increased competition as and to the extent the internet gains further acceptance as a method of conducting electronic commerce 
factors affecting operating results  potential fluctuations in quarterly results the company s future quarterly operating results may vary and reduced levels of earnings or losses could be experienced in one or more quarters 
fluctuations in the company s quarterly operating results could result from a variety of factors  including changes in the levels of revenue derived from sales of software products and electronic commerce services  the timing of new product and service announcements by the company or its competitors  changes in pricing policies by the company or its competitors  changes in accounting requirements  dictated by regulatory agencies or standards bodies including possibly retroactive changes  market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of the products and services of the company or its competitors  the size and timing of significant orders  changes in operating expenses  changes in the company s strategy  the introduction of alternative technologies  the effect of potential acquisitions and industry and general economic factors 
the company has limited or no control over many of these factors 
in addition  a somewhat greater portion of the company s revenues tends to be recognized in the fourth fiscal quarter as a result of a number of factors  including the company s incentive compensation structure for its sales personnel under which opportunities to earn higher commissions applicable to sales in excess of annual quotas and to realize other benefits associated with the achievement of such quotas are at their greatest during the fourth fiscal quarter 
the company operates with virtually no product order backlog because its software products typically are shipped shortly after orders are received 
as a result  product revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on the quantity of such products licensed in that quarter 
the company s expense levels are based  in part  on its expectations as to future revenues 
if revenue levels are below expectations  the company s operating results are likely to be adversely affected unless the company is willing and able to reduce its expenses proportionately 
as a result of the foregoing factors  comparisons of results of operations between particular periods are not necessarily meaningful and historical results of operations are not necessarily indicative of future performance 
technological change  dependence on new products and related risks the electronic commerce industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards 
the company s future success will depend in significant part on its ability to anticipate and guide industry standards  to continue to apply advances in electronic commerce product and service technologies  to enhance existing products and services and to introduce and acquire new products and services on a timely basis to keep pace with technological developments 
in this regard  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing  acquiring or marketing new or enhanced products or services that respond to technological change or evolving industry standards  that the company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  acquisition or marketing of such products or services or that the company s new or enhanced products and services will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance 
any delay or failure in the introduction of new or enhanced products or services  or the failure of such products or services to achieve market acceptance  could have a material adverse effect on the business  results of operations and financial condition of the company 
the introduction and marketing of new or enhanced products and services requires management of the transition from existing products and services in order to minimize the disruption in customer purchasing patterns 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully manage the transition to new or enhanced products and services 
further  there can be no assurance that products  services or technologies developed by others will not render the company s products  services or technologies obsolete 
from time to time  the company or its competitors may announce new products  services  capabilities or technologies that have the potential to replace or shorten the life cycle of the company s existing products and services offerings 
there can be no assurance that announcements of product enhancements or new product or service offerings will not cause customers to defer or cancel purchasing existing products and services 
any such deferrals or cancellations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
software products as complex as those used in the electronic commerce industry may contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or when new versions are released 
if software errors are discovered after introduction  the company could experience delays or lost revenues during the period required to correct these errors 
there can be no assurance that  despite testing by the company and by current and potential customers  errors will not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of  or delay in  market acceptance  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company faces certain risks relating to year issues 
in this regard  see the information set forth in year above  which is incorporated herein by reference 
growth through acquisitions a key element of the company s growth strategy has been strategic acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that in the future  acquisition candidates will be found on terms suitable to the company or that the company will have adequate resources to consummate any acquisition 
acquisitions involve a number of other special risks  including time and expenses associated with identifying and evaluating acquisitions  the diversion of management s attention  the difficulty in the integration of acquired products and services  the difficulty in combining different company cultures and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company
