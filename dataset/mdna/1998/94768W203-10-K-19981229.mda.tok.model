the company s actual results could differ materially from its historical operating results and from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  without limitation  those set forth below  under factors affecting future operating results and elsewhere in this report 
overview the company s products and services and the markets it serves have evolved and expanded in concert with the rapid advancements in technology and the elevated focus on human resource management 
from its inception in through the first half of fiscal  the company s product revenue consisted primarily of dos based applicant tracking and succession planning systems 
in june  the company introduced a windows based  client server staffing solution  which incorporates high volume resume scanning  skills management and search capabilities 
in november  the company broadened its offerings with the introduction of restrac webhire  a service which provides candidate management functions via the internet and the world wide web 
in june  the company released hire for intranet  the next generation enterprise level automated recruitment solution designed specifically for corporate intranets 
the new product and service releases in fiscal year enhanced the company s enterprise software operating segment and solidified its emerging internet and transaction based solutions segment 
total revenue consists of product revenue and services revenue 
product revenue is generated in the enterprise software operating segment and is derived from perpetual end user licenses to use the company s products 
product revenue is recognized upon delivery  provided there are no significant company obligations remaining and collectibility of the revenue is probable 
services revenue from customer maintenance fees for postcontract support is recognized ratably over the maintenance term  which is typically months 
when customer maintenance fees are included in an initial software license fee  the company allocates approximately of the software license fee to the first year s maintenance 
the amount allocated to customer maintenance fees for the first year is comparable to customer maintenance fees charged separately by the company 
other services revenue from training  installation  consulting and outsourced services eg  scanning  acknowledgement mailings is recognized as the related services are performed 
services revenue from restrac webhire is recognized ratably over the service term 
all customer maintenance fees for postcontract support and other services revenue for training  installation and consulting related to enterprise software licensed is attributed to the enterprise software operating segment 
services revenue for restrac webhire and for outsourced services is attributed to the internet and transaction based solutions segment 
during fiscal  the company increased the size of its operating facilities by over and entered into new leases for its corporate headquarters  its chicago office and its west coast office 
the direct increase in facilities costs associated with these leases was approximately million in fiscal and an additional for fiscal facilities costs are allocated among income statement expense categories based principally on functional headcount 
results of operations in thousands the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of total revenue represented by each item reflected in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
fiscal year ended september  as a percentage of total revenue revenue product revenue services revenue total revenue cost of revenue product revenue services revenue total cost of revenue gross margin operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income loss from operations other income  net income loss before provision benefit for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss revenue product revenue 
product revenue was   and  in fiscal  and  respectively  representing an increase of from fiscal to fiscal and a decrease of from fiscal to fiscal the increase in product revenue in fiscal resulted largely from an increase in the number of seats associated with shipments to both new and existing customers as well as an increase in the average price per seat 
more customers chose to license a large number of users with their initial system deployment  resulting in a significantly higher average sales price for fiscal some customers initially deploy the product on a selective  divisional or business unit basis and later license additional users 
over of the reduction in product revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal is attributable to smaller sales transactions 
the remaining reduction is due to lower shipment volumes in fiscal because the company s product revenue consists of a relatively small number of large dollar transactions  the average sales price and number of units shipped can fluctuate widely from period to period 
such fluctuations are not necessarily indicative of future results 
hardware resales contributed to the first fiscal quarter 
the company no longer serves as a reseller of hardware 
sales to existing customers represented approximately  and of total software licenses in fiscal years  and  respectively 
services revenue 
services revenue was   and  in fiscal  and  respectively  representing an increase of from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal increased maintenance revenue  generated by the continued growth in the restrac hire and resume reader for peoplesoft installed base  accounts for and of the total increase in services revenue for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the remaining increases are attributable to the company s emerging internet and transaction based solutions operating segment  with the introduction of restrac webhire in fiscal and the addition of outsourced scanning services late in fiscal there can be no assurances that the company will sustain these levels of services revenue growth 
cost of revenue cost of product revenue 
cost of product revenue includes royalty payments for third party software embedded in the company s products and costs of documentation and shipping 
cost of product revenue decreased as a percentage of product revenue to for fiscal from for fiscal and for fiscal the percentage decrease for both periods is due primarily to favorable rate revisions in the royalties due under third party licensing arrangements 
cost of services revenue 
cost of services revenue includes all costs of maintaining the client services organization and the internet and transaction based solutions segment operations  including salaries and personnel related expenses  travel  outside consulting services  facilities cost and  to a lessor extent  third party scanning services and royalty payments for software maintenance 
for fiscal  of cost of services was attributed to the enterprise software segment  with the remainder associated with the internet and transaction based solutions segment 
this compares to of cost of services attributed to the enterprise software segment for fiscal cost of services revenue increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal cost of services revenue increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal the increases in absolute dollars for each of the years are principally attributable to increased personnel and associated costs in the client services organization to support a larger client base and proportionately higher services revenue 
cost of services revenue increased as a percentage of services revenue to for fiscal from for cost of services revenue decreased as a percentage of services revenue to for fiscal from for the lower mix of services revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal is reflected in the slight increase in gross margin percentage to from 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses include all costs associated with the product engineering and quality functions  including salaries and personnel related expenses  travel  outside consulting services and facilities costs 
research and development expenses were  or of total revenue for fiscal as compared to  or of total revenue for fiscal and  or of total revenue for fiscal the increases in absolute dollars for the years presented are primarily due to increases in both personnel and consulting expenses in support of the company s new and existing product development initiatives and its quality assurance programs 
the internet and transaction based solutions segment accounted for of total research and development expenses in fiscal and in fiscal research and development expenses will vary from period to period as a percentage of total revenue dependent upon the stage in product development and the requisite investment funding of ongoing projects 
the company considers continued investment in research and development to be integral to its future success 
all of the company s research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include promotional costs and trade shows and costs associated with personnel involved in sales and marketing functions  including salaries  commissions and other personnel related expenses  travel  outside consulting services and facilities costs 
sales and marketing expenses were  or of total revenue for fiscal as compared to  or of total revenue for fiscal and  or of total revenue for fiscal the increase in absolute dollars in fiscal from fiscal is due primarily to the effect of the increased commissions expense resulting from the increase in revenue and to sales and marketing costs associated with restrac webhire  introduced in the first quarter of fiscal the internet and transaction based solutions segment accounted for of total sales and marketing expenses in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars in fiscal from fiscal is due to the company s investments in its sales organization in fiscal  adding personnel and expanding its west coast and central us facilities to accommodate the geographic distribution of sales and services personnel and to better support the customer base 
the company expects that sales and marketing expenses may vary from year to year as a percentage of total revenue 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist principally of costs for corporate operations personnel executive  finance and accounting  information technology  human resources  legal and administrative  professional fees and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses were  or of total revenue for fiscal as compared to  or of total revenue for fiscal and  or of total revenue for fiscal the absolute dollar increase for fiscal as compared to fiscal is the result of personnel increases  investments in internal systems and an increase in bad debt expense during the year 
the increase for fiscal as compared to fiscal  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue  is largely the result of personnel increases in support of the company s infrastructure  increased costs associated with the company s having gone public in fiscal  investments in internal systems and a charge in related to the move of the company s corporate headquarters 
other income  net other income was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the variances from period to period are due to fluctuations in the average combined cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investment balances 
the company expects to continue to yield investment income on its average balance of combined cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments at an average rate comparable to that experienced for fiscal provision benefit for income taxes the company s effective tax rate was  and for the fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
the changes in the effective tax rate for both fiscal as compared to fiscal and for fiscal as compared to fiscal relate principally to the generation of income or losses from operations during the respective periods 
minimal taxes are provided for other income generated during fiscal years  and as a result of the favorable tax status of restrac securities corporation and of the investment in municipal securities during these years 
thus  a higher ratio of other income to income from operations can significantly impact the effective tax rate from year to year 
the benefit generated from the net loss in fiscal was partially offset by minimum taxes due in certain state jurisdictions 
liquidity and capital resources at september   the company had cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments of  an increase of  from  at september  working capital was  at september  as compared to  at september   an increase of cash provided by operating activities was  during the year ended september  cash provided by operating activities consisted mainly of the net income for the fiscal year of  the effect of depreciation and amortization of  growth in deferred revenue of  and the timing of receipts and disbursements  resulting in prepayment of certain expenses  increases in accounts receivable and fluctuations in certain liabilities 
cash provided by investing activities was during the year ended september  cash provided by investing activities consisted mainly of net proceeds of  from the purchases and maturities of short and long term investments partially offset by the purchase of property and equipment of  primarily computer equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended september  was financing activities consisted of proceeds from the exercise of stock options  proceeds from the issuance of stock under the employee stock purchase plan and payments made under capital lease obligations 
to date  the company has not invested in derivative securities or any other financial instruments that involve a high level of complexity or risk 
cash has been  and the company contemplates that it will continue to be  invested in interest bearing  investment grade securities 
on november   the company acquired certain rights and assets and assumed certain obligations and liabilities of the junglee subsidiary of amazon 
com in exchange for  cash and  shares of common stock see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
from time to time  the company may evaluate other potential acquisitions of products  businesses and technologies that may complement or expand the company s business 
any such transactions consummated may use a portion of the company s working capital and or require the issuance of equity or debt 
the company believes that its current cash and cash equivalent and short term investment balances and cash provided by future operations will be sufficient to meet its working capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
although operating activities may provide cash in certain periods  operating and investing activities may use cash in other periods 
consequently  any future growth may require the company to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
impact of year issue the year issue results from computer programs written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
the following paragraphs in this section include year readiness disclosure within the meaning of the year information and readiness disclosure act 
the company has attempted to make an assessment with regard to whether its own internal information systems are year compliant 
in particular  the company has upgraded its accounting excluding payroll and customer management systems with systems that are warranted by the vendors to be year compliant 
in addition  the company plans to seek assurances from its existing vendors whose systems are not warranted to be year compliant that such systems are year compliant 
currently  the company does not anticipate purchasing additional systems 
the company does not separately track the internal costs incurred for year projects 
although the company does not believe that any additional year compliance related costs will be significant  there can be no such assurance 
any failure of third party equipment or software comprising any part of the company s systems to operate properly with regard to year and thereafter could require the company to incur unanticipated expenses to address associated problems 
the company has received assurances that all material embedded systems included in the company s products are year compliant 
the company believes  based on an internal assessment  that the current versions of its software products are year compliant 
the company limits its contractual warrantees on year compliance to objective performance standards that the company has tested  and the company makes no warrantees for nonconformance if the company s software products are combined with other software or data that are not conducive to accurately calculating  comparing or sequencing date and time data between the twentieth and twenty first centuries 
the company has no plan to ascertain whether the internal systems and products of its customers are year compliant 
although the company has not been involved in any litigation or proceeding to date involving its products or services related to year issues  there can be no assurance that the company will not in the future be required to defend its products or services or to negotiate resolutions of claims based on year issues 
the company does not have any specific contingency plans if any year problems develop with respect to the company s embedded systems  systems acquired from vendors or systems used by third parties with whom the company has a mutual relationship 
contingency plans will be developed if it appears the company or its key vendors will not be year compliant  and such non compliance is expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s operations 
year issues may affect the purchasing patterns of customers and potential customers in a variety of ways 
many companies are expending significant resources to replace or remedy their current hardware and software systems for year compliance 
these expenditures may result in reduced funds available to purchase software products such as those offered by the company 
the company does not believe that there is any practical way to ascertain the extent of  and has no plan to address problems associated with such a reduction in purchasing resources of its customers 
any such reduction could  however  result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the year issue is pervasive and complex  as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way 
consequently  no assurance can be given that year compliance can be achieved without significant additional costs 
factors affecting future operating results this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the statements contained in this report that are not purely historical are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities and exchange act of  as amended 
forward looking statements include  without limitation  statements containing the words anticipates  believes  expects  intends  future  and words of similar import which express management s belief  expectations or intentions regarding the company s future performance 
all forward looking statements included in this report are based on information available to the company on the date hereof  and the company has no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
the company s actual results could differ materially from its historical operating results and from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  without limitation  those set forth below 
the company operates in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment that involves risks and uncertainties 
the following section lists some  but not all  of these risks and uncertainties which may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
this section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  and management s discussions and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the years ended september    and potential fluctuations in quarterly operating results the company s results of operations have been  and may in the future be  subject to significant quarterly fluctuations  due to a variety of factors  including the relatively lengthy sales cycle for the company s products  the relatively large size of a typical product sale  the timing of contracts  the introduction of new products by the company or its competitors  capital spending patterns of customers  the company s sales incentive strategy which is based in part on annual sales targets and general economic conditions 
historically  revenue in each of the first two fiscal quarters has been lower than in the preceding fourth fiscal quarter which typically has the highest revenue and net income  due largely to sales incentive programs 
a substantial portion of the company s revenue often occurs during the last few weeks of each quarter  therefore  any delays in orders or shipments are more likely to result in revenue not being recognized until the following quarter 
the company s current expense levels are based in part on its expectations of future revenue and  as a result  net income for a given period could be disproportionately affected by any reduction in revenue 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve significant revenue  that the level of revenue in the future will not decrease from past levels or that in some future quarter the company s revenue or operating results will not be below the expectations of stock market securities analysts and investors 
in such event  the company s profitability and price of its common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 
emerging markets the company s future success is substantially dependent on broader recognition of the potential benefits afforded by automated staffing software and services and the growth in demand for such solutions 
it is difficult to assess the size of the market  the customer demands that will evolve  and the competition that may emerge 
there can be no assurance that the market for automated staffing software and services will continue to grow or that the introduction of new technologies or services will not render the company s existing software and services obsolete or unmarketable 
the market for automated staffing solutions is undergoing rapid changes including continuing advances in technology and changes in customer requirements and preferences 
these market dynamics have been amplified by the emergence of the internet as a communications medium for staffing solutions 
the company s future success will depend in significant part on its ability to continually improve the performance  features and reliability of its software and services in response to the evolving demands of the marketplace and competitive product offerings  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in doing so 
in addition  an element of the company s business strategy is the advancement of products  functionalities and other staffing solutions that capitalize on the increasing use of the internet and corporate intranets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing products that will keep pace with technological changes in the market or new technologies introduced by competitors or that it will satisfy evolving consumer preferences 
maturation of internet and intranet based products  functionalities and other staffing solutions will also depend on increased acceptance of the internet for staffing solutions and the development of the necessary infrastructure to facilitate commercial applications on the internet 
there can be no assurance of such acceptance or infrastructure development 
failure to develop and introduce new products  functionalities and other staffing solutions in a timely fashion could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on principal product the company currently derives most of its revenue from its restrac hire including recently introduced hire for intranet product 
as a result  any factor adversely affecting sales of this product would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the future success of the company also depends  in part  on achieving broader market acceptance of restrac hire  as well as the ability to continue to enhance restrac hire to meet the evolving needs of its customers 
moreover  the company anticipates that its existing and new competitors will introduce additional competitive products 
this competition may reduce future market acceptance of restrac hire 
the market acceptance of the company s software is difficult to estimate due in large measure to the effect of new products  applications or product enhancements  technological changes in the marketplace for staffing solutions and future competition 
there can be no assurance that the company will maintain and expand acceptance of restrac hire 
the failure of the company to maintain and expand its market acceptance as a result of competition  technological change or other factors would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on key personnel the company s future success depends to a significant extent on its senior management and other key employees 
the company also believes that its future success will depend in large part on its ability to attract and retain additional key employees 
competition for such personnel in the computer software industry is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and training such personnel 
dependence on third parties a key element of the company s business strategy is to develop relationships with leading industry organizations in order to increase the company s market presence  expand distribution channels and broaden the company s product line 
the company believes that its continued success depends in large part on its ability to maintain such relationships and cultivate additional relationships 
there can be no assurance that the company s existing strategic partners or future strategic partners will not develop and market products in direct competition with the company or otherwise discontinue their relationships with the company  or that the company will be able to successfully develop additional strategic relationships 
in addition  certain technology incorporated in the company s software is licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis 
the termination of any of such licenses  or the failure of the third party licensers to adequately maintain or update their products  could result in delay in the company s ability to ship certain of its products while it seeks to implement technology offered by alternative sources 
in addition  any required replacement licenses could prove more costly than the company s current license relationships and might not provide technology as powerful and functional as the third party technology currently licensed by the company 
also  any such delay  to the extent it becomes extended or occurs at or near the end of a fiscal quarter  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations for that quarter 
while it may be necessary or desirable in the future to obtain other licenses relating to one or more of the company s products or relating to current or future technologies  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
risk of new product introductions  risk of product defects as the marketplace for staffing solutions continues to evolve  the company plans to develop and introduce new products and services to enable it to effectively address the changing needs of that market 
there is no guarantee that the company will be able to develop new products or services or that such solutions will achieve market acceptance or  if market acceptance is achieved  that the company will be able to maintain such acceptance for a significant period of time 
any inability of the company to quickly develop products and services that address changes in technology or customer demands may require the company to substantially increase development expenditures or result in loss of market share to a competitor 
products as complex as those offered by the company may contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions are released 
the company has in the past discovered software errors in certain of its product offerings after their introduction 
there can be no assurance that  despite testing by the company errors will not occur in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in adverse publicity  in loss of or delay in market acceptance  or in claims by the customer against the company  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
management of change the evolution of the company s business and expansion of the company s customer base has resulted in substantial growth in the number of its employees  the scope of its operations and financial systems and the geographic area of its operations  resulting in increased responsibility for management personnel 
the company s future results of operations will depend on the ability of its officers and other key employees to continue to implement its operational  customer support  and financial control systems and to expand  train  and manage its employee base 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any future expansion successfully  and any inability to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
reliance on single client interface and single server platform at the present time  the company supports client workstation platforms utilizing microsoft s windows family of software products  including windows  windows nt and windows if microsoft were to fundamentally change the architecture of its software product such that users of the company s software applications experienced significant performance degradation or were rendered incompatible with future versions of microsoft s windows operating system  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely effected 
if a new client platform or other interface were to gain broad acceptance in the marketplace  there can be no assurance that the company s architecture would be compatible with such an interface 
certain of the company s products exclusively operate on microsoft s nt server and internet information server iis platforms 
if microsoft were to fundamentally change the architecture of its server product such that users of the company s software applications experienced significant performance degradation or were rendered incompatible with future versions of microsoft s nt server or iis  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely effected 
if a new type of server were to gain broad acceptance in the marketplace  there can be no assurance that the company s architecture would be compatible with such a server 
limited protection of intellectual property and dependence on proprietary rights  risk of litigation the company relies on a combination of copyright and trade secret laws  employee and third party non disclosure agreements and other methods to protect its proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that the measures taken by the company to protect its proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology or independent development by others of similar technology 
in addition  the company may be subject to additional risk as it enters into transactions in countries where intellectual property laws are not well developed or are poorly enforced 
the company s inability to protect its proprietary rights would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
as the number of human resource application software products and services in the industry increases and the functionality of these solutions further overlaps  software developers and publishers may increasingly become subject to infringement claims 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company in the future with respect to current or future products 
although the company is not currently the subject of any intellectual property litigation  there has been substantial litigation regarding copyright  patent and other intellectual property rights involving computer software companies 
any claims or litigation  with or without merit  could be costly and could result in a diversion of management s attention  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
adverse determinations in such claims or litigation may require the company to obtain a license and or pay damages  which could also have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
volatility of stock price as is frequently the case with stock of high technology companies  the market price the company s stock has been and may continue to be quite volatile 
factors such as quarterly fluctuations in results of operations  announcements of technological innovations by the company or its competitors or the introduction of new products by the company or its competitors  and macroeconomic conditions in the computer software industries generally  may have a significant impact on the market price of the stock of the company 
if revenue or earnings in a quarter fail to meet expectations published or otherwise of the investment community  there could be an immediate impact on the company s stock price 
furthermore  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have particularly affected the market price for many high technology companies and which  on occasion  have been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies 
these broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect the market price of the stock of the company 
product liability although the company has not experienced any product liability claims to date  the sale and support of products by the company and the incorporation of products from other companies may entail the risk of product liability claims 
the company s license agreements with its customers typically contain provisions intended to limit the company s exposure to such claims  but such provisions may not be effective in limiting the company s exposure 
a successful product liability action brought against the company could adversely effect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations
