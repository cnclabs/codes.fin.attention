item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements set forth therein 
certain accounting considerations as a fundamental part of its business and financing strategy  delta sells the majority of its loans through securitization and derives a substantial portion of its income therefrom 
in a securitization  the company sells a pool of loans it has originated or purchased to a remic trust for a cash price 
the trust  in turn  finances the pool of loans it has acquired by issuing pass through certificates  or bonds  which represent undivided ownership interests in the trust 
the holders of the pass through certificates are entitled to receive monthly distributions of all principal received on the underlying mortgages and a specified amount of interest  as determined at the time of the trust offering 
when the company sells a pool of loans to the securitization trust  it receives the following economic interests in the trust a the difference between the interest payments due on the loans sold to the trust and the interest rate paid to the pass through certificateholders  less the company s contractual servicing fee and other costs and expenses of administering the trust  represented by interest only and residual certificates  and b the right to service the loans on behalf of the trust and earn a contractual servicing fee  as well as other ancillary servicing related fees directly from the borrowers on the underlying loans 
the company s net investment in the pool of sold loans at the date of the securitization represents the amount originally paid to originate or acquire the loan adjusted for i direct loan origination costs incurred an increase and loan origination fees received a decrease in connection with the loans  which are treated as a component of the initial investment in a loan under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for non refundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases  and ii the principal payments received  and the amortization of the net loan fees or costs  during the period the company held the loans prior to their securitization 
the company s investment in the loans also reflects adjustments for any gains a decrease in the investment or losses an increase in the investment the company has incurred on treasury rate lock contracts which the company has used to hedge against the effects of changes in interest rates during the period it holds the loans prior to their securitization 
see hedging 
upon the securitization of a pool of loans  the company i recognizes in income  as origination fees  the unamortized origination fees included in the investment in the loans sold  and ii recognizes a gain on sale of loans for the difference between cash received from the trust and the investment in the loans remaining after the allocation of portions of that investment to record interest only and residual certificates and mortgage servicing rights received in the securitization 
the majority of the net gain on sale of mortgage loans results from  and is initially realized in the form of  the retention of interest only and residual certificates 
the interest only and residual certificates received by the company upon the securitization of a pool of loans are accounted for as trading securities under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the amount initially allocated to the interest only and residual certificates at the date of a securitization reflects the fair value of those interests 
the amount recorded for the certificates is reduced for distributions thereon which the company receives from the related trust  and is adjusted for subsequent changes in the fair value of interest only and residual certificates  which are reflected in the statement of operations 
the company assesses the fair value of interest only and residual certificates based upon updated estimates of prepayment and default rates relating to loan groups comprised of loans of similar types  terms  credit quality  interest rates  geographic location and value of loan collateral  which represent the predominant risk characteristics that would affect prepayments and default rates 
in accounting for the securitization of its loans with the retention of mortgage servicing rights  the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities effective january  previously  the company followed the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for mortgage servicing rights 
the change from the requirements of sfas no 
to those of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s result of operations or financial position 
in accordance with sfas no 
 and previously sfas no 
 the amount of the investment in the loans allocated to the retained servicing rights is measured at the allocated carrying amount of such servicing rights  based on the fair value of the rights  which is determined by discounting to a present value using a discount rate which management believes reflects the rate market participants would utilize in purchasing similar loan servicing rights the estimated future contractual and ancillary servicing fees the company will receive and the estimated costs of servicing the loans 
those estimates are based on the stated terms of the transferred loans adjusted for estimates of future prepayment rates made on the basis of interest rate conditions and the availability of alternative financing  and estimates of future defaults among those loans  each of which would terminate the servicing of the loan and thus negatively affect servicing income 
this amount  which is classified on the balance sheet as capitalized mortgage servicing rights is then amortized over the period of the estimated net future cash flows from the servicing income 
sfas no 
also requires that the capitalized mortgage loan servicing rights be assessed periodically to determine if there has been any impairment of the asset  based on the fair value of the rights at the date of the assessment 
the company performs this assessment based on the same prepayment and default estimates utilized in valuing interest only and residual certificates 
a valuation allowance is provided for the capitalized servicing rights relating to any loan group for which the recorded investment exceeds the fair value of the servicing rights 
in recording and accounting for mortgage servicing rights and interest only and residual certificates  the company makes estimates of rates of prepayments and defaults  and the value of collateral  which it believes reasonably reflect economic and other relevant conditions then in effect 
the actual rate of prepayments  defaults and the value of collateral will generally differ from the estimates used  due to subsequent changes in economic and other relevant conditions and the implicit imprecision of estimates  and such differences can be material 
prepayment and default rates which are higher than those estimated would adversely affect the value of both the mortgage servicing rights actual mortgage servicing income will be less  and significant changes could require an impairment of the capitalized mortgage servicing rights and the interest only and residual certificates  for which changes in fair value are recorded in operations 
conversely  prepayment and default rates which are lower than those estimated would increase the servicing income earned over the life of the loans and positively impact the value of the interest only and residual certificates 
the company assumes prepayment rates and defaults based upon the seasoning of its existing securitization loan portfolio 
as of december  and  the company s underlying assumptions used in determining the fair value of its interest only and residual certificates are as follows a estimated annual prepayment rates i for fixed rate loan pools of beginning in the first month of seasoning and increasing in equal increments to by the twelfth month of seasoning and thereafter  ii for adjustable rate loan pools of beginning in the first month of seasoning and increasing in equal increments to by the twelfth month of seasoning and thereafter at december   compared to and  respectively  at december   b a default reserve for both fixed and adjustable rate loans sold to the securitizations trusts of of the amount initially securitized  and c an annual discount rate of in determining the present value of cash flows from residual certificates  which are the predominant form of retained interests 
the company uses the same prepayment assumptions in estimating the fair value of its mortgage servicing rights 
to date  actual cash flows from the company s securitization trusts have either met or exceeded management s expectations 
the company has  from time to time  sold its economic interest in the interest only certificates for cash proceeds including  most recently  the interest only certificates on three of its securitization transactions 
the company did not sell any of its interest only certificates in the company has also  from time to time  sold whole loans on a non recourse basis  without retaining servicing rights  generally in private transactions to individual or institutional investors 
upon the sale of loans on a whole loan basis  the company recognizes a gain or loss for the difference between the cash proceeds received for the loans and the investment in the loans  including unamortized loan origination fees and costs 
interest rate risk the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
profitability may be directly affected by the level of  and fluctuation in  interest rates  which affect the company s ability to earn a spread between interest received on its loans and the costs of its borrowings  which are tied to various united states treasury maturities and the london inter bank offered rate libor 
the profitability of the company is likely to be adversely affected during any period of unexpected or rapid changes in interest rates 
a substantial and sustained increase in interest rates could adversely affect the company s ability to purchase and originate loans 
a significant decline in interest rates could increase the level of loan prepayments thereby decreasing the size of the company s loan servicing portfolio 
to the extent servicing rights and interest only and residual classes of certificates have been capitalized on the books of the company  higher than anticipated rates of loan prepayments or losses could require the company to write down the value of such servicing rights and interest only and residual certificates  adversely impacting earnings 
fluctuating interest rates also may affect the net interest income earned by the company resulting from the difference between the yield to the company on loans held pending sales and the interest paid by the company for funds borrowed under the company s warehouse facilities  although the company undertakes to hedge its exposure to this risk by using treasury rate lock contracts 
see hedging 
recent growth the company has experienced significant loan origination and purchase growth in the last few years  particularly since january  management believes that this growth is primarily attributable to the company s i geographic expansion of its operations  ii further penetration into its established markets  iii increased access to capital and additional funding sources through a the capital markets and b larger warehouse finance agreements which have enabled the company to accumulate larger pools of loans for sales through securitizations  and iv recent expansion of its production channels through the acquisition of the fidelity mortgage  retail operations 
in connection with its geographic expansion  the company has continued to focus on developing loan production from brokers and correspondents 
in addition  the company is also committed to developing and growing the fidelity mortgage retail origination network 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to grow significantly in the future 
any future growth will be limited by  among other things  the company s need for continued funding sources  access to capital markets  sensitivity to economic slowdowns  ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  fluctuations in interest rates and competition from other consumer finance companies and from new market entrants 
to date  the company has not experienced any significant seasonal variations in loan originations and purchases 
the company s recent and rapid growth may have a somewhat distortive impact on certain of the company s ratios and financial statistics and may make period to period comparisons difficult 
in light of the company s growth  historical performance of the company s earnings may be of limited relevance in predicting future performance 
furthermore  the company s financial statistics may not be indicative of the company s results in future periods 
any credit or other problems associated with the large number of loans originated and purchased in the recent past may not become apparent until sometime in the future 
the comparability of the results of operations for the twelve months ended  and financial position as of  december  and may also be affected by the company s acquisition of fidelity mortgage 
fidelity mortgage was acquired on february  for a combination of cash and stock  with the acquisition accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues total revenues for the twelve months ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the comparable period in the increase in revenue was primarily attributable to the increase in net gains recognized on the sale of mortgage loans  reflecting the growth in the company s level of loan originations and purchases and securitizations 
revenue also increased in all other categories including origination fees  servicing fees  and interest income 
for the twelve months ended december   the company originated and purchased billion of mortgage loans  representing a increase from million of mortgage loans originated and purchased for the twelve months ended december  the company issued four quarterly closed end home equity loan securitizations in totaling billion  compared to three securitizations and loan sales of million in total loans serviced at december  increased to billion from million at december net gain on sale of mortgage loans 
net gain on sale of mortgage loans represents i the sum of a the fair value of the interest only and residual certificates associated with loans securitized in each period  b the fair value of mortgage servicing rights associated with loans securitized in each period  and c premiums earned on the sale of whole loans on a servicing released basis  ii less the x premiums paid to originate or acquire mortgage loans  y costs associated with securitizations and z any hedge loss gain 
for the twelve months ended december   net gain on sale of mortgage loans increased million  or  to million from million for the twelve months ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in loans securitized in of billion  or  compared to million of loans sold or securitized for the same period in net gains from the sale of loans increased less than the overall increase in loan securitizations primarily because of increases in the pass through rates required by remic trust investors in the fourth quarter of  which reduced the value of the interest only and residual certificates the company received in connection with that quarter s securitization 
as previously noted above  the company changed its prepayment assumptions on adjustable rate mortgage loans in the third quarter of this change  which affects the valuation of the company s existing interest only and residual certificates and capitalized mortgage servicing rights  as well as the valuation of those assets in all future securitizations  was made based upon the company s on going analysis of industry and company prepayment trends 
the change in this assumption did not have a material effect on net gain on sale 
the weighted average gain on sale ratio for the twelve months ended december   and for the comparable period in  was and  respectively 
the weighted average gain on sale ratio is calculated using the net gain on sale divided by the total amount of loans securitized and sold 
interest income 
interest income primarily represents the sum of i interest earned on loans held for sale  ii interest earned on cash collection balances  and iii the difference between the distributions the company receives on its interest only and residual certificates and the adjustments recorded to reflect the change in the fair value in the interest only and residual certificates 
interest income for the twelve months ended december  increased million  or  to million from million in the comparable period in the increase in interest income was primarily due to a a higher average balance of mortgage loans held for sale during the twelve months ended december  driven by higher loan originations and purchases as noted above  and b an increase in excess servicing received from the company s interest only and residual certificates  partially offset by the fair value adjustment to the interest only and residual certificates  primarily related to distributions received from the securitization trusts 
the company changed its prepayment assumptions on adjustable rate mortgages in the third quarter of  which did not have a material effect on interest income 
servicing fees 
servicing fees represent all contractual and ancillary servicing revenue received by the company less a the offsetting amortization of the capitalized mortgage servicing rights  and any adjustments recorded to provide valuation allowances for the impairment in mortgage servicing rights see accounting considerations  and b prepaid interest shortfalls 
servicing fees for the twelve months ended december  increased million  or  to million from million in the comparable period in this increase was primarily due to a higher average loan servicing portfolio  which resulted in increased contractual and ancillary service fees  partially offset by a million increase in amortization of the company s capitalized mortgage servicing rights in  compared to during the twelve months ended december   the average balance of mortgage loans serviced by the company increased to billion from million during the comparable period in the amount of mortgage loans serviced by the company increased at a faster rate than the amount of servicing fees  primarily as a result of a reduction in the contractual servicing fee rate from to per annum beginning with the securitization in september origination fees 
origination fees represent fees earned on brokered and retail originated loans 
origination fees for the twelve months ended december  increased million  or  to million from million in the comparable period in the increase is primarily the result of a the acquisition of fidelity mortgage and the subsequent expansion of its retail network which accounted for million of origination fees in  and b a increase in broker originated loans and commensurate increase in broker loan origination fees 
expenses total expenses increased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended december   from million for the comparable period in the increase in expenses was primarily the result of i increased interest expense due to a higher interest costs generated by the growth in the company s loan origination and purchase activities  which increased the level of debt needed throughout to finance the resulting higher inventory of loans held for resale  b the company s issuance in july of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due august  the senior notes and c financing the company s investment in interest only and residual certificates which was subsequently eliminated using a portion of the proceeds from the senior notes  ii an increase in the company s personnel related to higher loan origination growth  including the company s fidelity mortgage retail division and iii costs associated with the expansion of the company s retail  broker and correspondent divisions 
payroll and related costs 
payroll and related costs include salaries  benefits and payroll taxes for all employees 
for the twelve months ended december   payroll and related costs expense increased million  or  to million from million for the comparable period in this increase is primarily related to staff increases related to the acquisition and subsequent expansion of fidelity mortgage and the increase in loan originations and purchases at the company 
as of december   the company employed full and part time employees  of which are employees of fidelity mortgage  compared to full and part time employees as of december interest expense 
interest expense includes the borrowing costs to finance loan originations and purchases under i the company s credit facilities  ii the senior notes  and iii its investment in interest only and residual certificates 
for the twelve months ended december   interest expense increased million  or  to million from million for the comparable period in the increase in interest expense was attributable to i growth in loan activity  which increased the level of debt needed throughout to finance the inventory of loans held for sale prior to their securitization  ii the company s issuance in july of the senior notes  iii financing of the company s interest only and residual certificates which was subsequently eliminated using a portion of the proceeds from the senior notes  and iv a higher cost of funds on the company s credit facilities which were tied to one month libor 
the one month libor index increased to an average interest rate of in  compared to an average interest rate of in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of office rent  insurance  telephone  depreciation  goodwill amortization  real estate owned expenses  license fees  legal and accounting fees  travel and entertainment expenses  advertising and promotional expenses and the provision for loan losses on the inventory of loans held for sale and recourse loans 
for the twelve months ended december   general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million from million for the comparable period in this increase was primarily attributable to i the amortization of acquisition costs goodwill associated with the company s purchase of fidelity mortgage  ii the expansion costs associated with the company s increasing the number of fidelity mortgage retail branch offices from five to thirteen during  and iii an increase in expenses associated with the company s increase in loan origination and purchases in income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized on the income reported in the financial statements regardless of when such taxes are paid

income taxes provided a effective tax rate for the year ended december   compared to a assumed effective tax rate for the year ended december  if the company would have been a c corporation for the entire period 
the reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to the company s expansion into lower taxing state and local jurisdictions

interest income 
interest income increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase in interest income was primarily due to a higher average balance of loans held for sale during resulting from the increases in loan originations and purchases  but was partially offset by the shorter holding period in which the mortgage loans remained in inventory during the company completed three securitizations during compared to two securitizations in servicing fees

during  the average balance of mortgage loans serviced by the company increased to million from million during origination fees 
origination fees increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to an increase in broker loan originations to million in the year ended from million in comparable period of loan origination fees increased at a slower rate than broker loan originations primarily because the company earned lower average origination fees per loan 
expenses total expenses increased million  or  to million for from million in the increase in expenses was primarily the result of increased interest expense on loans held for sale and higher operating expenses associated with the additional personnel required to process the greater number of loan originations and purchases 
total expenses increased at a slower rate than total revenues  primarily due to efficiencies realized from the company s investment in technology  experienced staff and economies of scale 
payroll and related costs 
payroll and related costs increased million  or  to million for from million for the increase was primarily due to increased staffing in the company s originations area associated with the increase in loan originations and purchases  as well as the company s expansion into new and existing markets

financial condition december  compared to december  cash and interest bearing deposits increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase was primarily the result of additional monies held in securitization trust accounts by the company  acting as servicer for its ongoing securitization program 
accounts receivable increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase was attributable to i a higher average loan servicing portfolio  which resulted in increased reimbursable servicing advances made by the company  acting as servicer on its securitizations  and ii a million income tax receivable related to current tax assets 
loans held for sale decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this decrease was primarily the result of a larger percentage of loans securitized  compared to loans originated and purchased  in accrued interest and late charges receivable increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this increase was primarily due to a higher average loan servicing portfolio which resulted in increased reimbursable interest advances made by the company  acting as servicer on its securitizations 
the company s average servicing portfolio increased to billion as of december  from million as of december  capitalized mortgage servicing rights increased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  this increase was directly attributable to the company s capitalizing the fair market value of the servicing assets  totaling million  resulting from the company s completion of four securitizations during  partially offset by the amortization of capitalized mortgage servicing rights 
interest only and residual certificates increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the company received interest only and residual certificates initially valued and recorded at million in its four securitizations in offsetting adjustments to reflect distributions  and changes in fair value  totaled million 
prepaid and other assets increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase was primarily due to the capitalized issuance costs related to the company s million senior note offering in the third quarter of which is being amortized over the seven year life of the senior notes 
warehouse financing and other borrowings decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  during the third quarter of  the company used the net proceeds from its senior notes offering to pay down its warehouse facility and interest only and residual financings 
the aggregate principal balance of the senior notes totaled million at december   net of unamortized bond discount 
the senior notes accrue interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually on february and august  commencing on february  the company did not have any senior notes outstanding prior to july investor payable increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this increase was primarily due to the increase in the company s portfolio of serviced loans to billion at december  from million at december  investor payable is comprised of all principal collected on mortgage loans and accrued interest 
variability in this account is primarily due to the principal payments collected within a given collection period 
stockholders equity increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this increase is due to net income for the twelve month period of million and the issuance of  additional shares of common stock valued at million in connection with the company s acquisition of fidelity mortgage 
liquidity and capital resources the company has operated  and expects to continue to operate on a negative cash flow basis due to increases in the volume of loan purchases and originations  the growth of its securitization program  and potential acquisitions 
currently  the company s primary cash requirements include the funding of i mortgage originations and purchases pending their pooling and sale  ii the points and expenses paid in connection with the acquisition of correspondent loans  iii interest expense on its senior notes and warehouse and other financings  iv fees  expenses and tax payments incurred in connection with its securitization program  and v ongoing administrative and other operating expenses 
the company has relied upon a few lenders to provide the primary credit facilities for its loan originations and purchases 
the company must be able to sell loans and obtain adequate credit facilities and other sources of funding in order to continue to originate and purchase loans 
as a result of increased loan originations and purchases and the expansion of its securitization program  the company  during  and  had an operating cash flow deficit of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
historically  the company has utilized various financing facilities and an equity financing to offset negative operating cash flows and support the continued growth of its loan originations and purchases  securitizations and general operating expenses 
on july   the company completed an offering of the senior notes 
a portion of the senior notes proceeds were used to pay down various financing facilities with the remainder to be used to fund the company s growth in loan originations and purchases and its ongoing securitization program 
the company s primary sources of liquidity continue to be warehouse and other financing facilities  securitizations and  subject to market conditions  sales of whole loans and additional debt and equity securities 
to accumulate loans for securitization  the company borrows money on a short term basis through warehouse lines of credit 
the company has three warehouse facilities for this purpose 
one warehouse facility is a million committed credit line with a variable rate of interest and a maturity date of february this facility was converted from an uncommitted to a committed line during the three months ended march  and  subsequent to december   the maturity date was extended from february to february the company s second warehouse facility is a million committed revolving line with a variable rate of interest and a maturity date of february in february  management elected not to renew this line 
the company s third warehouse facility is a syndicated million committed revolving line with a variable rate of interest and a maturity date of june this facility was increased from million to million subsequent to december  the outstanding balances on the million facility  million facility and million facility as of december  were million  and  respectively 
in february  a new million committed revolving line with a variable rate of interest was secured by the company to replace the company s second warehouse facility which expired in february this new facility has a maturity date of february the company has in the past obtained financing facilities for interest only and residual certificates acquired as part of its securitizations 
as of december   the company did not have any indebtedness secured by interest only and residual certificates 
in addition  the company is limited by the terms of the indenture governing the senior notes as to the amount of future indebtedness permitted to be secured by interest only and residual certificates 
the company had a million line of credit with a financial institution to support its daily operating requirements  which it elected to let expire in september the company is required to comply with various operating and financial covenants as provided in the agreements described above which are customary for agreements of their type 
the company does not believe that its existing financial covenants will restrict its operations or growth 
the continued availability of funds provided to the company under these agreements is subject to the company s continued compliance with these covenants 
management believes that the company is in compliance with all such covenants under these agreements as of december  hedging the company originates and purchases mortgage loans and then sells them primarily through securitizations 
at the time of securitization and delivery of the loans  the company recognizes gain on sale based on a number of factors including the difference  or spread between the interest rate on the loans and the interest rate on treasury securities with maturities corresponding to the anticipated life of the loans 
if interest rates rise between the time the company originates or purchases the loans and the time the loans are sold at securitization  the excess spread narrows  resulting in a loss in value of the loans 
the company has implemented a strategy to protect against such losses and to reduce interest rate risk on loans originated and purchased that have not yet been securitized through the use of treasury rate lock contracts with various durations which are similar to selling a combination of united states treasury securities  which equate to a similar duration of the underlying loans 
the nature and quantity of hedging transactions are determined by the company based upon various factors including  without limitation  market conditions and the expected volume of mortgage originations and purchases 
the company will enter into treasury rate lock contracts through one of its warehouse lenders and or one of the investment bankers which underwrite the company s securitizations 
these contracts are designated as hedges in the company s records and are closed out when the associated loans are sold through securitization 
if the value of the hedges decrease  offsetting an increase in the value of the loans  the company  upon settlement with its counterparty  will pay the hedge loss in cash and realize the corresponding increase in the value of the loans as part of its net gain on sale of mortgage loans and its corresponding interest only and residual certificates 
conversely  if the value of the hedges increase  offsetting a decrease in the value of the loans  the company  upon settlement with its counterparty  will receive the hedge gain in cash and realize the corresponding decrease in the value of the loans through a reduction in the value of the corresponding interest only and residual certificates 
the company believes that its current hedging strategy of using treasury rate lock contracts is the most effective way to manage its interest rate risk on loans prior to securitization 
as of december   the company s mark to market unrealized hedge loss was million 
inflation inflation affects the company most significantly in the area of loan originations and can have a substantial effect on interest rates 
interest rates normally increase during periods of high inflation and decrease during periods of low inflation
