multifamily real estate expenses as a percentage of multifamily rental revenues after adjustment for net leased land revenue decreased from in to in and to in although not measurable with precision  management believes that this decrease resulted in part from the internalization of property management and economies of scale derived from increased concentration of assets in the company s markets 
provision for depreciation and amortization the provision for depreciation and amortization increased by  for the year ended december  as compared to and increased  for the year ended december  from that of the increase in these years resulted from additional depreciation on properties acquired in the transaction  the merger and additional multifamily property acquisitions 
depreciation expense for includes such expense on properties acquired in the transaction from november to december  and does not include any depreciation expense on the eight properties under construction because such properties were not placed in service in further  during and  dispositions of commercial and retail properties generally resulted in a higher depreciable base and depreciation expense as the cost basis plus the realized gain was reinvested 
interest expense interest expense increased  to  in which amount is net of  of capitalized interest for construction in progress

the expense amount also reflects a reallocation of certain costs previously included in general and administrative expense to real estate expense commencing august  provision for possible investment losses during the quarter ended june   the company recorded a  provision for possible investment losses   was charged against the investment in the pomona warehouse property which was sold in the quarter ended december  to reflect management s estimate of permanent impairment in value which impairment was based on the expected sales value

the increase from the year ended december  to is due primarily to the gain on sales of rental properties in and contributions to net income from properties acquired 
impact of inflation over of the company s total revenues for were derived from apartment properties 
due to the short term nature of most apartment leases typically one year or less  the company may seek to adjust rents to mitigate the impact of inflation upon renewal of existing leases or commencement of new leases  although there can be no assurance that the company will be able to adjust rents in response to inflation 
in addition  occupancy rates may also fluctuate due to short term leases that permit apartment residents to leave at the end of each lease term at minimal cost to the resident 
year considerations some of the company s older computer programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  those computer programs have time sensitive software that recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could cause a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in other normal business activities 
the company has completed an assessment which will replace portions of its software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the total estimated year project cost is estimated to be approximately  and such costs will be expensed according to the company s existing policy

the project is estimated to be completed no later than december   which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
the company believes that with the conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived from numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors
