item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general contract premiums and contract benefit costs the company s principal revenues are derived from contract premiums  most of which are collected on a monthly basis 
contracts are generally guaranteed renewable and non cancelable except for fraud  non payment of contract premiums or upon written request by the member 
contract benefit costs vary depending on the type of contract 
closed panel plans provide the contract benefits only through a designated provider attorney with whom the company has arranged for the services to be provided in a particular geographic area 
provider attorneys receive a fixed monthly payment for each member in their service area and are responsible for providing the contract benefits without additional remuneration 
the fixed cost aspect of closed panel plans provides significant advantages to the company in managing its claims risk 
under closed panel plans  the company has the ability to more effectively monitor the quality of legal services provided and  due to the volume of claims that may be directed to particular provider attorney law firms  has access to larger  more diversified law firms 
at december   approximately of the company s contracts were closed panel plans compared to at december  contract benefit costs relating to open panel contracts  which constituted approximately of contracts in force at december   are based on the usual  reasonable and customary fee for providing the required services 
such costs are generally paid on a current basis as most costs are certain in amount and require only limited investigation 
the company maintains a reserve for estimated incurred but not reported open panel contract benefit costs as well as costs which are in the payment process 
these reserves are reviewed annually by an independent actuary as necessary in conjunction with the preparation and filing of financial statements and other reports with various state insurance regulatory authorities 
underwriting risks associated with the open panel contracts are managed primarily through contractual benefit limitations and  as a result  underwriting decisions are not necessarily based on individual contract purchases 
commissions beginning with new membership contracts written after march   the company implemented a level commission schedule which results in the company incurring commission expense related to the sale of its legal expense plans on a basis more consistent with the collection of the premiums generated by the sale of such contracts 
prior to march   the company had incurred much higher commissions approximately during the first year of the membership with substantially lower commissions approximately in all subsequent years 
the level commission structure results in the company incurring commissions at the rate of approximately per year for all membership years 
prior to january   the company advanced commissions at the time of sale of all new contracts 
effective january   the company implemented a policy whereby the associate receives only earned commissions on the first three sales unless the associate has successfully completed the new training program which was implemented at the same time 
for all sales beginning with the fourth membership or all sales made by an associate successfully completing the new training program  the company currently advances commissions at the time of sale of a new membership contract 
the amount of cash potentially advanced upon the sale of a new membership  prior to the recoupment of any charge backs described below  represents an amount equal to three years commission earnings 
although the average number of marketing associates receiving an advance commission payment on a new membership is  the overall initial advance may be paid to more than twenty different individuals  each at a different level within the overall commission structure 
this commission advance immediately increases an associate s account with the company and represents prepaid commissions on active memberships 
should a membership lapse before the advances have been recovered for each commission level  the company immediately generates a charge back to the applicable sales associate to recapture of any unearned advance 
this charge back is immediately deducted from any future advances that would otherwise be payable to the associate for additional new memberships 
the company historically has been able to immediately recover the majority of such charge backs 
any remaining unrecovered advance on a membership that has lapsed represents a receivable from the associate and is reflected as commission advances and is categorized as current or non current based on the expected recovery period 
additionally  even though a commission advance may have been fully recovered on a particular membership  no additional commission earnings from any membership will be paid to an associate until all previous advances on all memberships  both active and lapsed  have been recovered 
during  of all associates submitting new memberships accounted for of all such new memberships produced thereby further enhancing the recovery of commissions advances 
the company s commission advance policy exposes the company to the risk of uncollectible commission advances particularly for associates who do not receive commissions on a large number of memberships or who experience below average contract persistency 
the company closely monitors such commission advances to ensure maximum recoverability and maintains a recoverability reserve which at december  and  was million and million  respectively 
associates also receive compensation when associates sponsored by them or other associates that they have sponsored in their organization successfully complete the new training program implemented by the company on january  in order to successfully qualify  the new associate going through the training program must produce new contracts and recruit new associate within days of receiving the training 
contract persistency one of the major factors affecting the company s profitability and cash flow is contract persistency  which represents the ability of the company to retain a contract  and therefore receive premiums  once it has been written 
the company monitors its overall contract persistency rate  as well as the persistency rates with respect to contracts sold by individual associates and agents and persistency rates with respect to contract sales by geographic region and payment method 
the company s contract persistency rate measures the number of contracts in force at the end of a year as a percentage of the total of i contracts in force at the beginning of such year  plus ii new contracts sold during such year 
from through the year ended december   the company s annual contract persistency rates  using the foregoing method  have averaged approximately 
the annual contract persistency rates were  and for  and  respectively 
the company s overall contract persistency rate varies based on  among other factors  the relative age of total contracts in force 
the company s overall contract persistency rate could be lower when the contracts in force include a higher proportion of newer contracts 
the company has recently experienced significant increases in new contract sales and  as a result  the percentage of newer contracts in its total contracts in force has increased 
unless offset by other factors  this increase could result in a decline in the company s overall contract persistency rate as determined by the formula described above  but does not necessarily indicate that the new contracts written are less persistent  only that the ratio of new contracts to total contracts is higher than it was during and the company s financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected if the persistency rates of existing and new contracts are materially lower than the company s historical experience 
operating ratios two principal operating measures monitored by the company in addition to contract persistency are the loss ratio and the expense ratio 
the loss ratio represents contract benefit costs as a percentage of contract premiums 
the expense ratio represents the total of commissions  general and administrative expenses and premium taxes as a percentage of contract premiums 
the company has revised the expense ratio definition for to provide data it believes more accurately reflects trends in the company s growth 
all prior periods have been conformed to current year presentation 
the company strives to maintain a combined loss and expense ratio as low as possible 
the combined ratio does not measure total profitability because it does not take into account all revenues and expenses 
cash flow considerations relating to sales of contracts the company generally advances significant commissions at the time a contract is sold 
since approximately of contract premiums are collected on a monthly basis  a significant cash flow deficit is created at the time a contract is sold 
this deficit is reduced as monthly premiums are remitted and no additional commissions are paid on the contract until all previous commission advances have been fully recovered 
since the cash advanced at the time of sale of a new membership contract will be recovered over a three year period  cash flow from operations may be adversely affected depending on the number of new membership contracts written in relation to the existing active base of contracts and the composition of new or existing sales associates producing such contracts 
income tax matters net operating losses at december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards nols for federal regular and alternative minimum tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  expiring in through in addition  the company had general business and rehabilitation tax credit carryforwards of approximately  expiring primarily in to  and an alternative minimum tax amt credit carryforward of  which does not expire 
a valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets representing pre carryforwards  except as related to the amt credit carryforward which is considered to be fully realizable  as the company does not believe it is more likely than not that the tax benefits of such carryforwards will be realized 
the company generated a tax loss for the year ended december  of million 
the company believes it will realize the approximate  tax benefit from this tax loss and the approximate  of tax benefits from the tax loss of million and has appropriately not provided a valuation allowance against these amounts 
the company accrued tax expense for and at the applicable statutory rates and expects to continue such accrual for since it does not expect to be able to utilize available tax benefits from its existing pre carryforwards 
however  if the level of tax deductions for commissions is less than expected in as a result of new contract sales being less than expected or for any other reason  the company may have taxable income 
in such case  the company s tax expense for would be reduced to reflect any actual or anticipated future utilization of deferred tax benefits through reduction in the current valuation allowance 
the ability of the company to utilize nols and tax credit carryforwards to reduce future federal income taxes of the company is also subject to various limitations under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
one such limitation is contained in section of the code which imposes an annual limitation on the amount of a corporation s taxable income that can be offset by those carryforwards in the event of a substantial change in ownership as defined in section ownership change 
in general  an ownership change occurs if during a specified three year period there are capital stock transactions which result in an aggregate change of more than in the beneficial ownership of the stock of the company 
the company is not aware of any pending or contemplated transactions that would result in an ownership change under section however  the company does not have control over all possible variables which can affect the ownership change calculation and  accordingly  it is possible that an ownership change could occur in the future 
the effect of any such ownership change on the company s financial condition or results of operations cannot be determined because it is dependent upon unknown future facts and circumstances at the time of any such change  including  among others  the amount of the company s nols  the fair market value of the company s stock and the company s other tax attributes 
associate services the company derives revenues from services provided to its marketing sales force  principally from a one time enrollment fee of approximately prior to february  and prior to july from each new sales associate and the sale of marketing supplies and promotional materials to associates on an ongoing basis 
effective january   the company implemented a training program which allows an associate who successfully completes the program to advance through the various commission levels at a faster rate 
associates participating in this program pay a one time fee of instead of the fee 
the increased fee covers the additional training and materials used in the training program 
the company enrolled  new sales associates during compared to  during and  during  resulting in significant increases in associate services revenues and costs 
the company s direct costs of providing materials and services to associates are reflected as costs of associate services and direct marketing 
amounts collected from sales associates are intended primarily to offset the company s direct and indirect costs incurred in recruiting  monitoring and providing materials to sales associates and are not intended to generate material profits from such activities 
investment policy the company s investment policy is to some degree controlled by certain insurance regulations  which  coupled with management s own investment philosophy  results in a conservative investment portfolio that is not risk oriented 
the company s investments consist principally of short term instruments issued by the united states treasury  insured bank certificates of deposit  high grade government bonds and similar investments 
the company is required to pledge investments to various state insurance departments as a condition to obtaining authority to do business in certain states 
year issues the company has conducted a comprehensive review of its computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the year issue and has developed a plan to resolve the issue 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s affected programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a major system failure or miscalculations 
the company presently believes that  with modifications to existing software and conversion to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for the company s computer systems as so modified and converted 
testing and conversion of system applications commenced during and is expected to be completed during costs incurred in prior periods have not been material 
the remaining total cost of the company s remediation efforts is expected to be approximately  substantially all of which will be incurred during this amount is not expected to have a material effect on results of operations  liquidity or capital resources during or future periods 
a significant portion of the company s year remediation plan will be accomplished by the company s internal programming staff and while such efforts will result in the concentration on year programming  these costs are not likely to be incremental costs to the corporation  but rather will represent the redeployment of existing information technology resources 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not completed in a timely fashion  the year issue may have a material adverse impact on the operations of the company

contract premiums and their impact on total revenues in any period are determined directly by the number of active contracts in force during any such period

new contract sales increased during to  from  during at december   there were  active contracts in force compared to  at december  additionally  the average annual premium per contract has increased from for all contracts in force at december  to for all contracts in force at december   a increase  as a result of a higher portion of active contracts containing the additional pre trial hours benefit at an additional cost to the member together with increased sales of the small business legal defense plan 
associate services revenue increased from million for to million during primarily as a result of fast start which resulted in the company receiving training fees of approximately million during the new combination classroom and field training program  titled fast start to success fast start  is aimed at increasing the level of new membership sales per associate 
the positive impact of the program is reflected in the increase in new memberships written and new sales associates recruited per fast start associate 
fast start requires a training fee of per new associate and upon successful completion of the program provides for the payment of certain training bonuses 
in order to be deemed successful for fast start purposes  the new associate must write three new memberships and recruit one new sales associate within days of the associate s fast start training

the company believes that the decline in new associate enrollment during is primarily attributable to the increased costs associated with the fast start program 
however  while the number of new associates decreased during  the number of new contracts sold  at least partially as a result of the fast start program  increased significantly 
future revenues from associate services will depend primarily on the number of new associates enrolled and the number who choose to participate in the company s training program  but the company expects that such revenues will continue to be largely offset by the direct and indirect cost to the company of training bonuses paid  providing associate services and other direct marketing expenses
