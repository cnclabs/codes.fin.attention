the company s engineered steel bars business reflected improvements in net sales and operating income for fiscal compared to fiscal the improved results were due primarily to higher sales volume  but also reflect the benefits realized from the company s capital expenditure programs  which have allowed the company to increase production  enhance quality and manage manufacturing costs 
the company s aluminum products business experienced lower operating income for fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of the start up costs for piper impact s new plant  including higher labor and training expenses and the temporary use of less efficient production processes  as well as weaker margins between selling prices and raw material costs 
these margins  referred to herein as price spreads  are a key financial performance indicator in the aluminum products business 
the company currently expects that overall business levels for fiscal should be similar to those experienced during however  domestic and global market factors will impact the company and any slowdown in the us economy could affect demand and pricing for many of the company s products 
the start up costs at piper impact s new plant are expected to continue to affect earnings through the first half of fiscal the sale of lasalle in april and the sale of the tubing operations in december will affect income for fiscal by the difference between the amount these businesses would have earned and the reduction in interest expense as a result of the repayment of debt with the net proceeds from these sales 
improved financial results will be dependent upon  among other things  whether the continued strength of the economy can be sustained  improvements in the markets which the company serves and improvement in the price spreads of aluminum products
