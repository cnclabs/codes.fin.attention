item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview the self storage industry is highly fragmented and is composed predominantly of numerous local and regional operators 
competition in the markets in which the company operates is significant and is increasing from additional development of self storage facilities in many markets which may negatively impact occupancy levels and rental rates at the company s self storage facilities 
however  the company believes it possesses several distinguishing characteristics which enable it to compete effectively with other owners and operators 
the company believes it is the largest owner and operator of self storage facilities in the united states with ownership interests in  self storage facilities containing approximately million net rentable square feet 
all of the company s facilities are operated under the public storage brand name  which the company believes is the most recognized and established name in the self storage industry 
located in the major metropolitan markets of states  the company s self storage facilities are geographically diverse  giving it national recognition and prominence 
this concentration establishes the company as one of the dominant providers of storage space in each market that it operates in and enables it to use a variety of promotional activities  such as television and radio advertising as well as targeted discounting and referrals  which are generally not economically viable for its competitors 
in addition  the company believes that geographic diversity of the portfolio reduces the impact from regional economic downturns and provides a greater degree of revenue stability 
in an effort to attract a wider variety of customers  to further differentiate the company from its competition and to generate new sources of revenue  additional products are being offered to enhance the company s self storage business 
in late  the company organized public storage pickup and delivery  inc as a separate corporation and a related partnership the corporation and partnership are collectively referred to as pspud to operate a portable self storage business that rents storage containers to customers for storage in central warehouses 
the concept of pspud is to provide an alternative to a traditional self storage facility wherein customers transport their goods to the facility and rent a space to store their goods 
pspud will deliver a storage container s to the customer s location where the customer  at his convenience  packs his goods into the storage container 
pspud will subsequently return to the customer s location to retrieve the storage container s for storage in a central warehouse 
pspud is not intended to replace the traditional self storage facility but is designed to complement and provide additional services to the customers not offered at the self storage facilities 
during  pspud opened facilities  which combined with facilities opened as of the beginning of the year brought the total number of facilities to the facilities are located in greater metropolitan areas in states 
averaging approximately  containers per facility  a facility provides approximately  net rentable square feet which is slightly larger than a average self storage facility which contains approximately  net rentable square feet 
currently  all of the pspud facilities operate in facilities leased from third parties which has provided the company with an efficient and flexible means of expanding rapidly into markets 
at december   the pspud facilities in aggregate had  occupied containers  representing approximately  square feet 
the company believes  that to some extent  the portable self storage business may negatively impact the occupancy levels of self storage facilities located in the same markets 
however  the company s average self storage occupancy level is higher than at any comparable period in prior years  despite the promotion and rental activity of the portable self storage business in the same markets 
in the los angeles  california market  for example  where the company has operated a consistent pool of self storage facilities since  the occupancy levels of these facilities increased from million occupied square feet at january  to million occupied square feet at january   representing an increase of approximately 
during the same period of time  the newly opened pspud facilities in the los angeles market increased their aggregate occupied containers from  square feet at january to   square feet at january accordingly  in aggregate self storage and portable self storage combined  occupied square footage increased from million at january  to million at january   representing an increase of approximately  square feet 
the company is seeking to replicate this performance in other major markets in which it operates 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful 
due to the start up nature of the new business venture  pspud generated operating losses which materially impacted the company s earnings in and is expected to continue to generate losses during the company  however  continues to believe that it should invest in pspud  which responds to a promising business opportunity in at least certain markets and complements the company s existing self storage operations through joint use of a national telephone reservation system and a coordinated media advertising program designed to increase consumer awareness and rental activity of both traditional self storage facilities and portable self storage 
one of the keys to the successful operation of self storage and portable self storage businesses has been and will continue to be the national telephone reservation system 
commencing in early  the company implemented a national telephone reservation system designed to provide added customer service 
customers calling either the company s toll free telephone referral system  store  or a self storage facility are directed to the national reservation system where a representative discusses with the customer space requirements  price and location preferences and also informs the customer of other products and services provided by the company and its subsidiaries 
the national telephone reservation system was not fully operational for most of the company s facilities until the latter part of the fourth quarter of currently  the national telephone reservation system receives approximately  calls per month and has approximately representatives 
the company believes that the national telephone reservation system permits effective marketing for both self storage and portable self storage facilities and is primarily responsible for increasing occupancy levels and realized rental rates experienced at the self storage facilities during compared to the same period in the prior year 
the company will continue to focus its growth strategies on i improving the operating performance of its existing portfolio of properties  ii increasing its ownership of self storage facilities through acquisitions of facilities owned by affiliates or third party owners  iii development of new self storage facilities  iv expansion and improvement of the operations of pspud  and v to a limited extent  through its existing ownership interest  will participate in the growth of ps business parks  inc  a publicly traded real estate investment trust focusing on the ownership and operation of commercial properties 
the company seeks to increase the operating performance of its existing portfolio of properties by i increasing average occupancy rates and ii achieving higher levels of realized monthly rents per occupied square foot 
the company believes that its property management personnel and systems combined with the national telephone reservation system and marketing programs will enhance the company s ability to meet these goals 
in addition to wholly owned self storage facilities  the company also operates  on behalf of approximately ownership entities in which the company has a partial equity interest  self storage facilities under the public storage name 
from time to time  some of these self storage facilities or interests in them are available for purchase  providing the company with a source of additional acquisition opportunities 
the company believes these properties include some of the better located  better constructed self storage facilities in the industry 
because these properties are partially owned by the company  it is provided with reliable operating information prior to acquisition and these properties are easily integrated into the company s portfolio 
during and  the company acquired and self storage facilities from affiliated entities in connection with mergers  respectively  and increased its ownership interest in and self storage facilities by acquiring additional interests in affiliated partnerships owning self storage facilities  respectively 
during and  the company acquired and self storage facilities from third parties  respectively 
similar to  the company does not expect third party acquisitions to be significant during fiscal  unless attractive investment opportunities are available 
since  the company has developed and opened a total of seven self storage facilities  one in  four in  and two in at december   four self storage facilities and ten portable self storage facilities were under construction 
since april  the company s development activity with respect to the self storage facilities  has been concentrated in a joint venture partnership between the company and a major state pension plan 
under the joint venture arrangement  the state pension plan contributes of the equity with the remaining of the equity being provided by the company to finance development 
there is no debt included in the partnership and the company  after a specified period of time  has an option to acquire the state pension plan s interest in the partnership 
due to the company s non controlling ownership interest  the joint venture partnership is not consolidated in the company s financial statements 
the partnership is expected to develop up to million of properties approximately facilities with expected store openings through mid during  the joint venture developed and opened seven self storage facilities approximately  square feet and had facilities under development approximately  square feet 
the feasibility of developing additional self storage and portable self storage facilities is ongoing 
the focus is on selected markets in which there are few  if any  facilities to acquire at attractive prices and where the scarcity of other undeveloped parcels of land or other impediments to development make it difficult to construct additional competing facilities 
in january and february  pspud opened five additional facilities 
pspud is currently developing ten facilities and has also identified an additional five sites for development which collectively have an aggregate estimated cost of million 
all such facilities are located in existing markets in which pspud currently operates 
on january   the company reorganized its commercial property operations into a separate private reit 
the private reit contributed its assets to a newly created operating partnership the operating partnership in exchange for a general partnership interest and limited partnership interests 
the company and certain partnerships in which the company has a controlling interest contributed substantially all of their commercial properties to either the operating partnership in exchange for limited partnership interests or to the private reit in exchange for common stock 
the company believes that the concentration of all the commercial properties and the property manager into one entity will create a vehicle which should facilitate future growth in this segment of the real estate industry 
the company will participate in the entity s growth through the company s ownership interest 
in  the private reit and operating partnership acquired ten commercial properties from third parties 
the aggregate purchase price of these facilities consisted of cash  common stock of the private reit and limited partnership interests of the operating partnership 
at december   the private reit and the operating partnership owned properties located in states 
the operating partnership also managed the commercial properties owned by the company and affiliated entities 
as of december   the company owned approximately of the private reit which owned approximately of the operating partnership 
the balance of the operating partnership is primarily owned by the company and partnerships controlled by the company 
on january   the private reit entered into an agreement with a group of unaffiliated institutional investors under which up to  in common stock would be issued 
 of this common stock was issued on january   with the remainder to be issued as funds are required to purchase commercial properties 
on march   the private reit merged into public storage properties xi  inc  a publicly traded reit and an affiliate of the company  and the name of the surviving corporation was changed to ps business parks  inc psbp 
in connection with the merger  psbp exchanged self storage facilities for commercial properties owned by the company 
upon completion of the merger  psbp and the operating partnership owned commercial properties approximately million square feet  and managed the commercial properties owned by the company and affiliated partnerships 
upon completion of the merger  the company and partnerships controlled by the company owned approximately of psbp and the operating partnership on a combined basis 
due to the company s controlling ownership interest in psbp and the operating partnership  the company included the operations of these entities in the company s consolidated financial statements as of december  however  as a result of the march  merger and the agreement to issue additional shares of common stock to the group of unaffiliated institutional investors  the company believes that its reduced ownership will no longer warrant the consolidation of these entities effective march  since  the company has significantly increased both its asset and capital base through the investment in additional real estate assets financed predominantly with the issuance of equity 
as a result  the increased asset base has translated into significant growth in the company s overall operating results 
the comparative growth in operating results between and is principally due to mergers with affiliated reits combined with acquisitions of additional real estate facilities and investments in real estate entities 
the comparative growth in operating results between and is principally due to the impact of the company s merger with public storage management  inc psmi  whereby the company became self administered and self managed and acquired substantially all of the united states real estate operations of psmi the psmi merger

the increase in net income per share for compared to was principally the result of improved real estate operations  partially offset by the operating losses generated by pspud s portable self storage business totaling  or per common share 
net income allocable to common shareholders and net income per common share for the year ended december  was negatively impacted by a special dividend totaling  paid on the company s series cc convertible preferred stock series cc during the first quarter of as a result of this special dividend  the company would not have been required to pay another dividend with respect to this stock until the quarter ended march  during the second quarter of  the series cc stock converted into common stock of the company 
accordingly during  all of the  per common share  on a diluted basis of dividends were treated as an allocation of net income to the preferred shareholders in determining the allocation of net income to the common shareholders 
the special dividend eliminated the quarterly dividend of million annual fixed charges of million

since that time  the company through acquisition and development activities has increased the number of self storage facilities by facilities  facilities and facilities 
self storage rental income and cost of operations presented on the consolidated statements of income reflect the operations of all the self storage facilities owned by the company and the consolidated entities 
for year to year comparisons  the following table summarizes the operating results before depreciation of those facilities owned throughout each of the past three years and those acquired during the past three years self storage operations year ended december  year ended december  percentage percentage change change dollar amounts in thousands  except rents per square foot rental income consistent group     post acquisitions     cost of operations consistent group     post acquisitions     net operating income consistent group     post acquisitions     consistent group data gross margin weighted average occupancy average realized annual rent per occupied square foot average scheduled annual rent per square foot number of facilities at the end of the period consistent group cumulative post acquisitions net rentable square feet at the end of the period consistent group     cumulative post acquisitions     for the consistent group of facilities owned throughout each of the three fiscal years  year over year improvements in rental income of in and in are the result of increased realized rent per square foot and increased weighted average occupancy levels  as reflected in the table above 
the company believes that the improvement in each of these areas is due to i the national telephone reservation system which was implemented during and the first part of  ii increased rental rates put into effect during second half of  and iii media advertising implemented during the second half of as indicated above  the company implemented a national telephone reservation system to provide added customer service 
customers calling either the company s toll free telephone referral system  store  or a local public storage facility  are directed to the national reservation system where a trained representative discusses with the customer space requirements  price and location preferences and also informs the customer of other products and services provided by the company and its subsidiaries 
in the second half of  the company began to increase its scheduled rents charged to new customers prior to promotional discounts and to existing tenants where warranted 
as a result  for fiscal  scheduled rents per square foot increased compared to in connection with the national telephone reservation system  the company experimented with pricing and promotional discounts designed to increase rental activity 
accordingly  promotional discounts which are included as a reduction to gross rents to arrive at rental income increased significantly from  in to  in and  in despite the increased discounts  the company s facilities experienced increased realized rents per square foot of in compared to and in compared to with the exception of property management fees  most of the self storage operating costs ie payroll  property taxes  repairs and maintenance  etc

as a result of becoming self managed in connection with the psmi merger  the company no longer incurs property management fees 
cost of operations for decreased compared to principally as a result of the elimination of property management fees for included in cost of operations for were management fees totaling  however  offsetting the decrease in property management fees in and are expenses with respect to the national telephone reservation system totaling  and  respectively 
development of self storage facilities commencing in  the company began to construct self storage facilities 
through december   the company constructed and opened for operation seven facilities  one of which began operations in august approximately  net rentable square feet  four in approximately  net rentable square feet and two in approximately  net rentable square feet 
at december   the company had four self storage facilities approximately  net rentable square feet under construction with an aggregate cost incurred to date of approximately million and total additional estimated cost to complete of million 
generally the construction period takes to months followed by a to month fill up process until the newly constructed facility reaches a stabilized occupancy level of approximately 
in april  the company formed a joint venture partnership with a state pension fund to participate in the development of approximately million of self storage facilities 
the company expects that substantially all of its development activities will be conducted in the joint venture partnership until the million is fully committed 
at december   the joint venture partnership had completed construction on seven self storage facilities approximately  net rentable square feet with a total cost of approximately million  and had facilities under construction approximately  net rentable square feet with an aggregate cost incurred to date of approximately million and total additional estimated cost to complete of million 
the partnership is funded solely with equity capital consisting of from the company and from the state pension fund 
the company accounts for its investment in the joint venture using the equity method

the operating results of the consistent group of properties over the past three years has been improving  with net operating income increasing principally due to improved realized rental rates and declining operating expenses 
as discussed above  effective march   the company will no longer consolidate psbp and the operating partnership 
this will have the effect of reducing commercial property revenue and cost of operations for those properties owned by psbp and the operating partnership 
equity in earnings of real estate entities as of december   the company had ownership interests in affiliated limited partnerships and two affiliated reits which comprise the unconsolidated entities 
the company s ownership interest in these entities is less than 
due to the company s limited ownership interest and control of these entities  the company does not consolidate the accounts of these entities for financial reporting purposes 
equity in earnings of real estate entities represents the company s pro rata share of earnings of the unconsolidated entities using the equity method 
similar to the company  the unconsolidated entities generate substantially all of their income from their ownership of self storage facilities which are managed by the company 
in the aggregate  the unconsolidated entities own a total of real estate facilities  of which are self storage facilities

the decrease in earnings compared to is principally the result of certain business combinations occurring in and whereby the company s existing ownership interest in certain entities were converted into wholly owned real estate facilities see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the increase in earnings in compared to is due to i the earnings reflecting a full year s operations for those interests acquired in the psmi merger as opposed to just one and one half months in  ii the company s acquisition of additional interests during in the unconsolidated entities which resulted in increased earnings from these entities see note to the consolidated financial statements offset by iii certain business combinations occurring in whereby the company s existing ownership interest in certain entities were converted into wholly owned real estate facilities see note to the consolidated financial statements

in the latter part of the fourth quarter of  pspud opened facilities in the los angeles market 
during  pspud opened a total of facilities facilities opened during the first quarter of  during the second quarter  during the third quarter  and during the fourth quarter of fiscal 
due to the start up nature of the business  pspud incurred operating losses totaling approximately million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  summarized as follows

of the facilities opened as of december   facilities had been opened in excess of seven months 
the capacity of these facilities ranges from  to  containers averaging  and as of december  these facilities had occupancy levels ranging from to averaging 
as with mini warehouses  pspud believes that the portable self storage business experiences some seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels with occupancies generally higher in the summer months than the winter months 
during  pspud experimented with monthly container rental rates and transportation fees charged to customers 
at december   monthly rental rates for the facilities ranged from to per container per month 
transportation fees charged to customers ranged from to for each of the move in and move out process 
however  during  pspud waived the move in fee to customers 
pspud believes that marketing and advertising activities positively impact move in activity 
commencing in the third quarter of  pspud began to advertise the portable self storage product on television in selected markets 
customers are directed to call the national reservation system where representatives discuss the customers storage needs and are able to schedule delivery of containers to customers locations 
during  approximately million and million was incurred in television and yellow page advertising  respectively 
marketing and advertising activities have not been consistently implemented in all markets 
pspud believes there may be markets in which its business will not be successful despite consistent marketing and advertising and is evaluating the advisability of continuing to operate in certain markets 
currently all of the pspud facilities are operated in buildings which are leased from third parties 
a typical facility generally has personnel manager and truck drivers  to trucks  and a corresponding number of forklifts 
substantially all the equipment is leased 
direct operating costs principally includes payroll  facility and equipment truck and forklift lease expense 
during  pspud incurred significant general and administrative costs related to recruiting and training personnel  equipment  computer software and professional fees in organizing this business 
pspud will continue to expend funds during in connection with these activities 
however  the amounts of which are expected to be less than in during  pspud has opened an additional facilities in markets where pspud facilities are currently operating 
the number of new store opening in is not determinable  however  future opening will predominantly be in existing markets in which pspud currently operates 
by opening in existing markets  pspud will seek to gain benefits from economies of scale 
pspud is also developing facilities and has identified additional sites for development 
all of these development projects are located in existing markets with expected opening dates commencing during the second half of until the pspud facilities are operating profitably  pspud s operations are expected to continue to adversely impact the company s earnings 
pspud believes that its business is likely to be more successful in certain markets than in others 
there can be no assurances as to the level of pspud s expansion  level of gross rentals  level of move outs or profitability 
property management operations in connection with the psmi merger  the company acquired property management contracts  exclusive of facilities owned by the company  for self storage facilities and  through a subsidiary  the management contracts for commercial properties 
these facilities constitute all of the united states self storage facilities and commercial properties doing business under the public storage name and all those in which the company has an interest 
at december   the company managed  self storage facilities  owned by affiliates of the company and owned by third parties and the operating partnership managed commercial properties  all of which are owned by the company or affiliates of the company 
the property management contracts generally provide for compensation equal to  in the case of the self storage facilities  and  in the case of the commercial properties  of gross revenues of the facilities managed 
under the supervision of the property owners  the company coordinates rental policies  rent collections  marketing activities  the purchase of equipment and supplies  maintenance activity  and the selection and engagement of vendors  suppliers and independent contractors 
in addition  the company assists and advises the property owners in establishing policies for the hire  discharge and supervision of employees for the operation of these facilities  including resident managers  assistant managers  relief managers and billing and maintenance personnel

because the company has significant ownership interests in all but of the facilities it manages  the revenues generated from its property management operations are generally predictable and are dependent upon the future growth of rental income for those facilities the company manages 
however  because the company has acquired in the past  and may continue to seek to acquire in the future  real estate facilities owned by the unconsolidated entities  the company s facility management income should decrease in compared to the acquisitions of such facilities will reduce management fee income 
effective march   the company will no longer consolidate psbp  the commercial properties manager 
this will have the effect of eliminating commercial properties management fee income and cost of operations 
other income and expense items interest and other income in an effort to attract a wider variety of customers  to further differentiate the company from its competition and to generate new sources of revenues  additional businesses are being developed though the company s subsidiaries that complement the company s self storage business 
these products include the sale of locks  boxes and packing supplies and the rental of trucks and other moving equipment through the implementation of a retail expansion program and truck rental program 
the net results of these businesses are presented along with interest and other income  as interest and other income

retail stores will be retro fitted to existing self storage facility rental offices or built in as part of the development of new self storage facilities  both in high traffic  high visibility locations 
interest and other income is primarily attributable to interest income on cash balances and interest income from mortgage notes receivable 
interest income from mortgage notes receivable was   and  in  and  respectively 
the company canceled mortgage notes receivable of approximately  in and  in in connection with the acquisition of real estate facilities securing such notes 
the company also acquired notes receivable of  in the psmi merger in and an additional  and  in and  respectively  from affiliated parties 
the other increases in interest income are primarily attributable to fluctuations in the level of invested cash balances  which are caused by the timing of investing equity offering proceeds in real estate assets 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was  in   in and  in these increases are principally due to the acquisition of additional real estate facilities in each period  the increase from to also includes the effect of amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with the psmi merger 
depreciation expense with respect to the real estate facilities was  in   in and  in  the increases are due to the acquisition of additional real estate facilities in through amortization expense with respect to intangible assets acquired in the psmi merger totaled  in   in and  in the amount representing a pro rated amount from november  through the end of the year 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense was  in   in and  in the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience increased general and administrative costs due to the following i the growth in the size of the company  ii the company s property acquisition activities have continued to expand  resulting in certain additional costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of additional real estate facilities  and iii pursuant to the psmi merger  the company became self advised  resulting in the company internalizing management functions which previously were provided by the company s investment adviser 
however  offsetting the increases in general and administrative expense has been the elimination of advisory fee expense 
general and administrative costs for each year principally consist of state income taxes for states in which the company is a non resident  investor relation expenses  and certain overhead associated with the acquisition and development of real estate facilities 
interest expense interest expense was  in   in and  in reflecting the company s reluctance to finance its growth with debt  debt and related interest expense remains relatively low compared to the company s overall asset base 
the company capitalized interest expense of  in   in and  in in connection with the company s development activities 
interest expense before the capitalization of interest was  in   in and  in the decrease in interest expense in compared to  principally is due to the retirement of debt in of approximately million 
the increase in interest expense in compared to principally is due to the assumption of a million  unsecured senior note in connection with the psmi merger on november  environmental costs the company s policy is to accrue environmental assessments and or remediation cost when it is probable that such efforts will be required and the related costs can reasonably be estimated 
the majority of the company s real estate facilities were acquired prior to the time when it was customary to conduct environmental assessments 
during  the company and the consolidated entities conducted independent environmental investigations of their real estate facilities 
as a result of these investigations  the company recorded an amount which  in management s best estimate  will be sufficient to satisfy anticipated costs of known remediation requirements 
at december   the company accrued  for estimated environmental remediation costs 
although there can be no assurance  the company is not aware of any environmental contamination of any of its facilities which individually or in the aggregate would be material to the company s overall business  financial condition  or results of operations 
the company believes that amounts accrued in are sufficient to satisfy anticipated costs 
advisory fees advisory fees were  in the advisory fee  which was based on a contractual computation  increased as a result of increased adjusted net income as defined per common share combined with the issuance of additional preferred and common stock during each of the periods 
advisory fees for fiscal represent such amounts from the beginning of the year through november   when the company became self advised pursuant to the psmi merger 
as a result of becoming self advised  the company no longer incurs advisory fees 
minority interest in income minority interest in income represents the income allocable to equity interests in consolidated entities which are not owned by the company 
since  the company has acquired portions of these equity interests through its acquisition of limited and general partnership interests in the consolidated entities 
these acquisitions have resulted in reductions to the minority interest in income from what it would otherwise have been in the absence of such acquisitions  and accordingly  have increased the company s share of the consolidated entities income 
however  offsetting the reduction in minority interest in caused by the acquisition of additional equity interests are the inclusion of additional partnerships in the company s consolidated financial statements as well as improved property operations 
during  the company acquired sufficient ownership interest and control in twelve partnerships and commenced including the accounts of these partnerships in the company s consolidated financial statements which amounted to an increase in minority interest in income of approximately  in in determining income allocable to the minority interest for  and consolidated depreciation and amortization expense of approximately   and  respectively  was allocated to the minority interest 
the changes in depreciation allocated to the minority interest was principally the result of the acquisition of limited partnership units in the consolidated entities by the company throughout fiscal  and offset by an increase resulting from the above mentioned consolidation of partnerships 
impact of year the company has completed an initial assessment of its computer systems 
the majority of the computer programs were installed or upgraded over the past few years and are year compliant 
some of the older computer programs utilized by the company were written without regard for year issues and could cause a system failure or miscalculations with possible disruption of operations 
each of these computer programs and systems has been evaluated to be upgraded or replaced as part of the company s year project 
the cost of the year project will be allocated to all entities that use the company computer systems 
the cost of the year project which is expected to be allocated to the company is approximately million 
the cost of new software will be capitalized and the cost of software maintenance will be expensed as incurred 
the project is expected to be completed by march  which is prior to any anticipated impact on operating systems 
the company believes that with modifications to existing software and  in some instances  the conversion to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems 
however  if such modifications are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company

the company s credit ratings on its senior preferred stock by each of the three major credit agencies are baa by moody s and bbb by standard and poors and duff phelps 
the company s portfolio of real estate facilities remains substantially unencumbered 
at december   the company had mortgage debt outstanding of million and had consolidated real estate facilities with a book value of billion 
the company has been reluctant to finance its acquisitions with debt and generally will only increase its mortgage borrowing through the assumption of pre existing debt on acquired real estate facilities 
over the past three years the company has funded substantially all of its acquisitions with permanent capital both common and preferred stock 
the company has elected to use preferred stock despite the fact that the dividend rates of its preferred stock exceeds current interest rates on conventional debt 
the company has chosen this method of financing for the following reasons i the company s perpetual preferred stock has no sinking fund requirement  or maturity date and does not require redemption  all of which eliminate any future refinancing risks  ii preferred stock allows the company to leverage the common stock without the attendant interest rate or refinancing risks of debt  and iii like interest payments  dividends on the preferred stock can be applied to the company s reit distributions requirements  which have helped the company to maintain a low common stock dividend payout ratio and retain cash flow

the company has satisfied the reit distribution requirement since funds from operations total funds from operations or ffo increased to  for the year ended december  compared to  in and  in ffo available to common shareholders after deducting preferred stock dividends increased to  for the year ended december  compared to  in and  in ffo means net income loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles before i gain loss on early extinguishment of debt  ii minority interest in income and iii gain loss on disposition of real estate  adjusted as follows i plus depreciation and amortization including the company s pro rata share of depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated equity interests and amortization of assets acquired in the psmi merger  including property management agreements and goodwill  and ii less ffo attributable to minority interest 
ffo is a supplemental performance measure for equity reits as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc nareit 
the nareit definition does not specifically address the treatment of minority interest in the determination of ffo or the treatment of the amortization of property management agreements and goodwill 
in the case of the company  ffo represents amounts attributable to its shareholders after deducting amounts attributable to the minority interests and before deductions for the amortization of property management agreements and goodwill 
ffo is presented because many industry analysts consider ffo to be one measure of the performance of the company and it is used in establishing the terms of the class b common stock 
ffo does not take into consideration capital improvements  scheduled principal payments on debt  distributions and other obligations of the company 
accordingly  ffo is not a substitute for the company s cash flow or net income as discussed above as a measure of the company s liquidity or operating performance
