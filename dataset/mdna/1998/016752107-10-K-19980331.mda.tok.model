item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of this section is to discuss and analyze the company s financial condition  liquidity and capital resources and results of operations 
this analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this report 
liquidity and capital resources in  the company posted a small loss and net cash was used for operations as a result of a decrease in premiums written and a program to reduce pending claims and settle claims more quickly than in the past 
during the two year period ended december   the company operated profitably and net cash was provided from operations 
at december  and the yield of the company s fixed maturities portfolio was and  respectively  with an average maturity of years for each year 
additionally  at december   approximately of the fixed maturities portfolio was invested in issues of the us government and its agencies with the remainder invested in investment grade corporate and industrial issues 
the company presently anticipates reinvesting the majority of proceeds from maturities and investment income in substantially similar investments 
the company believes its immediate cash needs will not require the sale of long term fixed maturities  although it may sell certain of these securities from time to time 
the company maintains cash  short term and readily marketable securities and anticipates that the cash flow from investment income and maturities of long term fixed maturities will be sufficient to satisfy its anticipated cash needs 
the company does not presently anticipate paying dividends in the near future and believes it has sufficient capital to meet its currently anticipated level of operations 
results of operations net earned premium revenues of the company decreased by approximately million  or  in and increased by approximately million and million in and respectively and in and  respectively 
in  the decline in earned premium revenues was primarily due to the depopulation of the assigned risk pools million and a reduction in certain commercial lines  principally voluntary commercial automobile million and workers compensation million due to competition  reunderwriting and repricing 
in addition  earned premium revenues were reduced in by million to record premiums due under retrospectively rated reinsurance contracts written for and prior accident years 
the company re estimated the premium due based upon its current estimate of loss ratios for and prior accident years 
partially offsetting these reductions was an increase in certain voluntary personal lines  principally private passenger automobile and homeowners 
in  although higher premium rates were charged on certain lines of business than in including amounts related to increased minimum automobile liability coverage required by new york state  such rate increases were largely offset by a decrease in the number of policies in force 
this decrease primarily resulted from the depopulation of the assigned risk pools and reduced volume in other lines of business that were not profitable  primarily certain specialty programs within voluntary commercial automobile lines 
in addition  in the company experienced increased competition  primarily in workers compensation and commercial package policies  which reduced volume 
during the three years ended december   the company received servicing fees for providing administrative and claims services for the nypap 
during  the premium volume that the group managed under this program significantly declined primarily due to the ongoing depopulation of the nypap  which is expected to continue  and increased competition 
during  the group s agreement with nypap contributed approximately  to the company in pre tax income  net of servicing expenses 
effective february   the group ceased serving as a servicing carrier for the nypap  thereby enabling the group to concentrate its resources on its core non service businesses and redeploy certain resources previously dedicated to the nypap 
accordingly  the group will not provide such services in  except for the run off of the remaining nypap claims  which will occur over approximately a two year period 
the group believes it has provided sufficient reserves for future claims servicing costs related to such run off business 
the company s combined ratios as determined under gaap and sap were as follows years ended december  gaap sap the combined ratios of the company increased in  primarily reflecting an increase in the accident year loss ratios  principally for the private passenger automobile and commercial assigned risk lines of business  based upon increased claim frequency and continued unfavorable development of prior accident year losses 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in expenses primarily due to a reduction in the reserve for prior years servicing carrier expenses and reduced expenses reflecting reduced premium volume in included in the company s results for  and were approximately million in  million in and million in for reserve strengthening related to losses from prior accident years 
in and  the reserve strengthening primarily related to voluntary commercial automobile and commercial package lines of business  while in  the reserve strengthening primarily related to automobile and workers compensation lines of business 
the reserve strengthening included approximately million for commercial package lines of business and approximately million for voluntary commercial automobile lines of business 
during  the company reviewed the adequacy of the reserves carried for its open claims files  as part of its normal ongoing practice  focusing on the commercial package  general liability and commercial automobile lines of business 
as a result of this review and the continued unfavorable development of prior accident years losses  particularly the through accident years  the company has revised its assumptions regarding future increases in average claims severity and reserves were strengthened 
the reserve strengthening included approximately million for voluntary commercial automobile lines of business and approximately million for commercial package lines of business 
beginning in  the company entered into new market segments of the voluntary commercial business  including specialty programs for sanitation trucks  gas stations  fuel oil deliveries and limousines 
initially  the company based its loss ratio estimate upon its experience with similar lines of business  industry statistics and standard actuarial ultimate loss projection techniques  which consider expected loss ratios 
during  claims began to develop unfavorably and the company used such claim development to revise the assumptions that formed the basis of actuarial studies and reserves were increased 
with respect to commercial package lines  general liability claims for business written in through also developed unfavorably 
these claims showed an increased frequency of losses as well as an increase in the time between the date the loss occurred and when the loss was reported compared to prior experience 
general liability claims are susceptible to the emergence of losses over an extended period of time 
the reserve strengthening included approximately million for private passenger automobile lines of business and million for workers compensation lines of business 
in early  the private passenger automobile business increased significantly as a result of the acquisition of a large block of assigned risk business 
the acquisition of this block of business nearly doubled the volume previously written by the company 
early in  losses began to develop in this line of business that indicated a higher ultimate loss ratio than the company had experienced on similar blocks of assigned risk business from earlier periods  which experience formed the basis of the company s original loss estimate 
the company believes the increased losses in this line resulted primarily from its inability to effectively process a much larger volume of claims from its significantly increased customer base 
consequently  claims investigation and file documentation were not conducted timely which led to higher claim costs 
with respect to workers compensation lines  the company s policies provide insurance coverage to the employer if employees are able to successfully assert liability for employer negligence in providing a safe working environment 
during  a relatively small number of such claims with large dollar values emerged that had not been previously anticipated 
the emergence of these claims  and the fact that the workers compensation line of business is susceptible to the emergence of losses over an extended period  resulted in a revision of the company s estimate of ultimate losses and reserves were increased 
for the lines of business discussed above  as well as all other property and casualty lines of business  the company employs a variety of standard actuarial loss projection techniques  statistical analyses and case base evaluations to estimate its liability for unpaid losses 
the actuarial projections include an extrapolation of both losses paid and incurred by business line and accident year and implicitly consider the impact of inflation and claims settlement patterns upon ultimate claim costs based upon historical patterns 
these estimates are performed quarterly and consider any changes in trends and actual loss experience 
any resulting change in the estimate of the liability for unpaid losses  including those discussed above  is reflected in current year earnings during the quarter the change in estimate is identified 
the reserving process relies on the basic assumption that past experience is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
the probable effects of current developments  trends and other relevant matters are also considered 
since the establishment of loss reserves is affected by many factors  some of which are outside the company s control or affected by future conditions  reserving for property and casualty claims is a complex and uncertain process  requiring the use of informed estimates and judgements 
as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed  the company s estimates and judgements may be revised 
while the effect of any such changes in estimates could be material to future results of operations  the company does not expect such changes to have a material effect on its liquidity or financial condition 
in management s judgement  information currently available has been appropriately considered in estimating the company s loss reserves 
the company will continue to evaluate the adequacy of its loss reserves on a quarterly basis  incorporating any future changes in trends and actual loss experience  and record adjustments to its loss reserves as appropriate 
investment income has decreased by approximately million  or in  as compared to an increase of million or in and million or in  primarily as a result of a decrease in premiums written and a program to reduce pending claims and settle claims more quickly during  and higher invested assets resulting from positive cash flows in and during  the company also recorded million in realized capital losses in the normal course of managing its investment strategy 
in  the company realized gains of million on the sale of fixed maturities  primarily us treasury notes 
during  the company realized losses of million on the sale of certain investments in order to shorten the average duration of its investment portfolio 
the combination of other underwriting expenses incurred and the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs reflected a decrease of approximately million  or in  and increases of million  or in the decrease in was primarily the result of lower operating costs  primarily relating to pension and severance benefits for certain employees  and a decrease in the provision for servicing carriers expenses in connection with the nypap  offset by higher systems costs 
the increase in was the result of higher operating costs primarily relating to pension and severance benefits for certain employees coupled with higher systems costs 
impact of inflation the company  as well as the property and casualty insurance industry in general  is affected by inflation 
with respect to losses  the company s claim severity is affected by the impact of inflation on the cost of automobile repair parts  medical costs and lost wages 
the costs of adjusting claims and other underwriting expenses have also been adversely affected by inflationary pressures on salaries and employee benefits 
the company receives rate increases based in part upon its experience as well as the industry s experience 
accordingly  premium increases generally follow the rate of inflation 
year and information technology systems the company has evaluated its information technology systems to determine the potential impact of the year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in miscalculations or system failures 
in  the group began to evaluate its information technology systems and their ability to support future business needs 
this led to a decision to acquire new policy management and accounting systems 
these systems provide enhanced functionality and improved processing for underwriting  claims  billing  collection  reinsurance  reporting and accounting and are designed to be year compliant 
the group anticipates that these new systems will be fully implemented in the company does not expect that the year issue will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations 
however  the year issue may affect other entities with which the company transacts business  and the company cannot predict the effect of the year issue on such entities
