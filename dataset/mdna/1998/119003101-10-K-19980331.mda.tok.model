change in financial condition total assets increased billion from million at december  to billion at december  this increase resulted primarily from increases in revenue earning vehicles of billion and intangibles of million resulting from the budget acquisition 
total liabilities increased billion from million at december  to billion at december  due primarily to an additional billion of net borrowings largely to finance the vehicles of bracc

inflation the increased acquisition cost of vehicles is the primary inflationary factor affecting the company s operations 
many of the company s other operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with increases in inflation generally resulting in increased costs of operations 
the effect of inflation driven cost increases on the company s overall operating costs is not expected to be greater for the company than for its competitors 
seasonality generally  in the vehicle rental industry  revenues increase in the spring and summer months due to the overall increase in business and leisure travel during this season 
the company increases the size of its fleet and work force in the spring and summer to accommodate increased rental activity during these periods and decreases its fleet and work force in the fall and winter 
however  many of the company s operating expenses such as rent  insurance and administrative personnel are fixed and cannot be reduced during the fall and winter 
the retail car sales business is subject to seasonal effects  with lower sales during the winter months 
year issue the company has assessed and continues to assess the impact of the year yk on its reporting systems and operations the yk issue 
the yk issue exists because many computer systems and applications currently use two digit date fields to designate a year 
as the century date occurs  certain date sensitive systems will recognize the year as the year or may not recognize the date at all 
this inability to properly treat or recognize the year may cause computer systems and applications to process critical information incorrectly 
during  the company recognized approximately million in expenses to modify existing computer systems and applications and estimates that an aggregate of approximately million will be incurred in and specifically for yk modification 
the most significant systems undergoing or to undergo modifications are the reservation and rental transaction processing systems 
a failure in these systems could cause significant disruption in customer service levels and therefore materially impact the company s operating results and financial condition 
the company expects to complete all major modification efforts by mid environmental matters the company has assessed and continues to asses the impact of environmental remediation efforts on its operations 
the company s exposure largely relates to the clean up and replacement of underground gasoline storage tanks 
during  the company recognized approximately 
million in expenses related to remediation efforts and estimates that an aggregate of approximately million will be incurred in and based on past experience  management expects these estimates will be sufficient to satisfy anticipated costs of known remediation requirements 
however  due to factors such as continuing changes in the environmental laws and regulatory requirements  the availability and application of technology  the identification of presently unknown remediation sites and changes in the extent of expected remediation efforts  estimated costs for future environmental compliance and remediation are subject to uncertainty and it is difficult to predict the amount or timing of future remediation requirements
