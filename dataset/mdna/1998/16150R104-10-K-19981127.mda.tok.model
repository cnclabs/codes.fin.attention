gain on sales of assets by unconsolidated joint venture net income results of operations 
total revenues for fiscal increased million to million  a improvement over the prior year 
the company s strategic plan  which was adopted several years ago  remains a focus for growth 
the continued focus on the plan during fiscal and  to some extent  generally strong domestic and canadian economies  assisted all of our divisions with growth in their traditional markets 
this sales improvement along with new product development and the benefit received by the inclusion of a full year of sales by our subsidiary  dc scientific  inc  which has now been consolidated with chase since january  were all important to our revenue improvement last year 
also  despite a difficult world economy  international revenue growth improved by  but still represents only of our total revenue for the fiscal year 
fiscal revenue increased to million when compared to the majority of this growth came from our traditional products  although dc scientific  inc became a subsidiary in january and  as a result  their sales were then consolidated with ours 
international sales increased to million during fiscal the dollar value of cost of products was higher in fiscal compared to both and these increases were volume related 
as a percent of sales  cost of products decreased to in as compared to and in and respectively 
raw material cost decreases during the periods were a significant part of the gross margin improvement 
these improvements were somewhat offset by some direct manufacturing expenses 
gross profit margins during the past three years were relatively stable and we would expect continued solid margins during the current fiscal year as long as current market trends prevail 
however  no assurances can be given in this regard 
competitive pressures prevent the company from recovering any significant amount of related cost increases 
selling and administrative expenses in increased by  and  respectively when compared to and however  as a percent of sales  was lower  and respectively  in comparison with and the dollar increases relate to the expenses associated with the higher levels of sales and costs related to investments in people that would be required in order to continue our ability to improve revenues and profitability 
interest expense decreased to  in as compared to  in and  in the interest decrease relates to a continuous reduction in bank debt 
a significant amount of the bank debt reduction during was a result of the cash dividend declared and paid by the stewart group  inc  as a result of the previously announced sale of certain assets to owens corning  which was concluded during the first quarter of fiscal the company also continues to benefit from solid earnings and low borrowing rates from its lender 
sales increases in our traditional products  compared with lower manufacturing costs mostly associated with raw material cost improvements  beneficial changes in product mix and productivity improvements have assisted in our profit improvement over the past few years 
management will continue this approach of seeking to maximize and expand our current business while at the same time seeking future opportunities through selective acquisitions 
the effective tax rate for is lower than the applicable tax rate 
this is largely due to the increased export sales through our chase export corporation subsidiary 
during the tax rate was about equal to the applicable rate 
however  the benefit received from the export sales increase was offset by the losses of dc scientific  inc which were reserved against and were not consolidated for tax filings 
the tax rate was somewhat lower because of the export sales improvement 
minority participation in subsidiary represents the minority shareholders equity in the losses of dc scientific  inc the equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures over the past few years relates to our ownership position in the stewart group  inc  toronto  canada 
our gain on sales of assets by unconsolidated joint venture during fiscal is a non recurring gain and the result of the sale of certain assets by the stewart group  inc joint venture to owens corning 
the transaction was concluded on november  liquidity and sources of capital 
cash flow generated from operations was  in as compared to  and  during and respectively 
receivable and inventory increases relative to the increased level of business were more than offset by the cash dividend received from the stewart group  inc that was related to the sale of assets to owens corning 
in  a significant part of the inventory and receivable build up was related to the consolidation of dc scientific  inc the majority of the cash flow improvement was related to reductions in inventory 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at the end of fiscal as compared to at the end of both and the unused available long term credit amounted to  at august   as compared to  at august  current financial resources and anticipated funds from operations are expected to be adequate to meet requirements for funds in the year ahead 
year the year issue concerns the potential exposures related to the automated generation of business and financial misinformation resulting from the application of computer programs which have been written using two digits  rather than four  to define the applicable year of business transactions 
management established an executive committee to review the year issue as well as our entire system 
the committee completed an assessment of the company s computer systems and the embedded systems contained in its manufacturing processes 
machinery and equipment used in key production processes utilizing imbedded chips were purchased over the last two five years and are yk compliant 
however  many of the company s programs have time sensitive software which could result in a system failure 
it was determined that our internal computer operation  both hardware and software  needed upgrading 
a decision was made to update and upgrade our entire informational system 
we anticipate that the entire cost of this conversion will be in the range of  and that these costs will be expensed or will be amortized over five years in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices 
management has put in place a plan to complete our conversion by june  the company also understands that there are risk factors associated with year that it cannot directly control  primarily the readiness of its key suppliers  distributors  and vendors 
we will work diligently on these concerns although there can be no assurance that the systems of any third party will be timely converted and which will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
during the first half of calendar  the company will address contingency plans that will address our key issues in the event that problems arise
