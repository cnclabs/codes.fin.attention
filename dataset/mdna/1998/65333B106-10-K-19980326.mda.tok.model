item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of see special note regarding forward looking statements on page 
these forward looking statements represent the expectations of the company s management as of the filing date of this form k 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by the forward looking statements due to risks and uncertainties  including those described under risk factors in part ii of this report and elsewhere in this form k 
the company s stockholders and potential investors should consider carefully these risks and uncertainties in evaluating nexstar pharmaceuticals financial condition and results of operations 
nexstar pharmaceuticals is an integrated biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery  development  manufacture and marketing of proprietary pharmaceutical products to treat life threatening and other serious oncological  hematological and infectious diseases 
the company markets ambisome  a liposomal formulation of amphotericin b  for the treatment of life threatening fungal infections  and daunoxome  a liposomal formulation of the anticancer agent daunorubicin  which is used as a first line therapy for the treatment of hiv associated kaposi s sarcoma ks 
the company currently relies on sales of ambisome in europe for a substantial majority of its product revenues and expects sales of ambisome in europe to account for a majority of its revenues in on august   the us food and drug administration approved ambisome for use in the united states as a primary therapy for patients with a low white blood cell count febrile neutropenia who have a presumed fungal infection  also known as fever of unknown origin or fuo  or with visceral leishmaniasis and as a secondary treatment for fungal infections that do not respond to amphotericin b treatment 
ambisome has been approved for sale by the regulatory authorities in countries for the treatment of life threatening fungal infections  including countries in which it has been approved as a primary therapy for some form of fungal infection 
daunoxome has been approved for sale as a primary therapy for ks in countries  including the united states  canada and all significant western european markets 
the company is also conducting clinical trials with a third product  the antibiotic mikasome  a liposomal formulation of amikacin a potent aminoglycoside antibiotic 
during the fourth quarter of  the company began a phase ii clinical study of mikasome to assess its use in patients with complicated urinary tract infections and is currently initiating a phase ii clinical trial of mikasome in adult patients with stable cystic fibrosis 
the company plans to conduct additional phase ii clinical trials with mikasome in several of the company s selex process derived compounds including aptamer antagonists to vascular endothelial growth factor vegf and aptamers which inhibit the activity of certain selectins are in preclinical or early preclinical development 
the company plans to file an investigational new drug ind application in the us during for its aptamer antagonist to vegf for the treatment of the most severe form of age related macular degeneration 
the timing of the ind application for the vegf antagonist and additional phase ii clinical trials for mikasome may be affected by many factors including  among others  unanticipated delays  unexpected preclinical or clinical trial results  as applicable  and difficulties in enrolling patients 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to meet the time schedule which it has established for any of its products 
nexstar pharmaceuticals was formed in as nexagen  inc on february   nexagen  inc merged the merger with vestar  inc 
vestar  a company formed in in connection with the merger  nexagen  inc changed its name to nexstar pharmaceuticals  inc the merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
except where otherwise indicated  this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations gives effect to the merger and the pooling of interests accounting treatment  and thus includes the results of vestar for all periods discussed 
international operations  currency fluctuations in connection with a majority of its european sales  the company prices its products in the currencies of the countries into which they are sold the payment currencies  and revenues in the past have been and in the future could be adversely affected by currency fluctuations 
a significant majority of the company s manufacturing costs are in us dollars 
therefore  any decline in the value of the payment currencies relative to the us dollar is likely to negatively impact gross margins for the company s products since the company s manufacturing costs would stay approximately the same while its revenue in terms of us dollars would decline 
sales in germany  the us  italy and spain together accounted for of the company s product sales for the year ended december  the company prices its products in each of these four countries in the local currency 
between january  and december   the exchange rate of the us dollar increased   and  respectively  against the german mark  the british pound  the italian lira and the spanish peseta 
absent an increase in the price of the company s products throughout europe or a general decline in the value of the us dollar versus most leading european currencies  the continued strength of the us dollar may significantly impact the company s revenues as denominated in us dollars 
nexstar pharmaceuticals hedges certain of its foreign currency exposures with respect to its outstanding trade accounts receivable and accounts payable through the use of forward contracts 
nexstar pharmaceuticals does not currently enter into speculative foreign currency transactions and does not write speculative options 
in the future  the company may begin currency hedging in connection with anticipated revenues and expenses and may use options in addition to forward contracts 
such hedging will be done solely for the purpose of protecting the company from foreign currency fluctuations 
the company recognizes a gain or loss for each forward contract equal to the difference between the contract rate and the market rate on each balance sheet date which is recorded as a selling  general and administrative expense 
at present  no deferred accounting is used in connection with the company s hedging activities 
notwithstanding its hedging activities which have not always included fully hedging against potential gains or losses  the company has in the past recognized foreign exchange gains and losses 
there can be no assurance that significant gains or losses will not be incurred in the future 
although a substantial majority of the company s product sales have been  and during are expected to be  in europe and the united states  the company sells its products throughout the world  including in east asia where many countries economies and capital markets have been severely and negatively affected in the past several months 
the values of many east asian countries currencies have declined substantially compared with the us dollar 
to date  the company has not been materially affected by economic events in east asia since i its sales in east asia are primarily in us dollars  ii historically sales to these countries have represented only a small fraction of nexstar pharmaceuticals revenues product sales to east asian countries in represented less than of the company s total revenues and iii the company has no offices or direct operations in this area 
the company  however  considers east asia to be an area of potential growth and during the first quarter of it entered into agreements with third party distributors for the sale of ambisome in china  including hong kong  and taiwan  in addition to the arrangements which it already has in place for the sale of ambisome in japan  south korea  malaysia  singapore and thailand 
therefore  any long term decline in the economies or currencies of east asian countries could have an impact on the future revenues of the company 
to the extent that the company sells its products in local currencies in this part of the world  it expects to employ currency hedging strategies similar to those which it uses for european currencies 
results of operations years ended december   and product revenues 
product revenues increased to million  to million and to million in  and  respectively  primarily due to increased unit sales of ambisome in european markets 
gains from increased unit sales of ambisome during were offset by a reduction in the average selling price as calculated in us dollars compared to corresponding periods in and  approximately of which reduction was due to the appreciation in the value of the us dollar compared to the european currencies received in payment for the product 
a significant majority of the company s product sales were in european currencies 
absent an increase in the price of the company s products throughout europe or a general decline in the value of the us dollar versus most leading european currencies  the continued strength of the us dollar may significantly impact the company s revenues as denominated in us dollars

this amount will increase if the amount of sales of ambisome in the us increases 
collaborative agreements and contracts 
collaborative agreement and contract revenues were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increase for was due to an agreement by schering ag  in february  to increase its annual funding to the company to million from million in connection with a collaborative research agreement first entered into in the decline in related to the expiration or termination of collaborations between the company and certain corporate partners 
collaborative agreement and contract revenue fluctuations are generally the result of changes in the number of funded research projects as well as the timing and performance of contract benchmarks 
interest income 
interest income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
interest income during increased primarily as a result of investing the proceeds from the company s sale in the third quarter of million of convertible subordinated debentures due the debentures

cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold was million  or of product revenues  million  or of product revenues  and million  or of product revenues  in  and  respectively 
the increase in cost of goods sold for was primarily due to increased sales of the company s products 
the decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of product revenues for was primarily due to a reduction in the average manufacturing cost of products sold by the company 
the decrease was partially offset by a reduction in the average revenue per vial of product sold primarily due to i a substantial appreciation of the us dollar compared to leading european currencies and ii increased sales of ambisome to fujisawa usa  inc fujisawa at cost in connection with the october  sales launch of ambisome in the us pursuant to an agreement between the two firms  the company and fujisawa co promote ambisome in the united states and the company sells ambisome to fujisawa at cost for sale in the us in addition  the company receives of the gross profits from all us sales which the company records as royalty income 
as the company s unit sales of ambisome to fujisawa increase as a percentage of total ambisome sales  the cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues is expected to increase 
in  the company recorded a charge of  for certain ambisome lots produced in prior years which subsequently failed to pass the company s quality control specifications 
cost of goods sold consists primarily of raw materials  allocation of overhead  labor and equipment costs and charges associated with services provided by outside vendors 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million  to million and to million for  and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses is substantially attributable to increased product development and research activities and related increases in personnel

selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million  to million and to million  or  and of product revenues  in  and  respectively 
the increase for is primarily related to i increased expenses in connection with the continued expansion of the company s marketing operations and ii a charge of  related to a warrant issued in connection with a million revolving line of credit entered into by the company 
the increase for primarily related to a the expansion of the company s marketing efforts  in particular  in connection with the launch of daunoxome and the continued expansion of the company s international operations  b an expense of  in connection with the termination of distribution agreements in australia and france  and c an increase of  in the company s allowance for doubtful accounts due to an increase in accounts receivable resulting primarily from increased sales of the company s products

in addition  the company recognized foreign exchange gains losses of approximately   and  in  and  respectively 
litigation settlement and related expenses 
for the year ended december   the company reported litigation settlement and related expenses of million compared to million and for and  respectively 
the increase for was primarily related to the august  settlement between the company and the liposome company  inc tlc in which the two companies agreed to dismiss all legal proceedings in connection with two us patents and their international counterparts held by tlc the patent litigation 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  the company made an initial payment to tlc of million and is required to make future payments based on ambisome sales 
because the payments are subject to certain minimum and maximum payments  the company recorded accounting charges in of million  of which million represented the net present value of all future minimum payments it is required to make and million represented the cash payment in the third quarter of the company does not expect the difference between its future minimum and maximum payments to tlc to be material 
during  the company had million in additional expenses related to the patent litigation 
interest expense 
interest expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase for was primarily due to interest payable by the company on the debentures and the company s bank borrowings

the net loss for included a one time  non cash charge of million for purchased research and development in connection with the supragen  inc acquisition 
patent matters the company believes that there will continue to be significant litigation in the pharmaceutical industry regarding patents and other intellectual property rights  but cannot predict the likelihood of it being involved in any disputes 
any new litigation could consume a substantial portion of the company s resources regardless of the outcome of such litigation 
on august   the company and tlc reached a settlement in which the two companies agreed to dismiss all legal proceedings involving tlc s reexamined us patent no 
 the tlc patent and us patent no 
 the tlc patent and their international counterparts 
the legal proceedings related to whether ambisome  the company s liposomal formulation of amphotericin b  infringed tlc s patents because of the manner in which it is freeze dried lyophilized 
in the settlement agreement between the parties the settlement agreement  tlc agreed that it would not sue the company in connection with the worldwide production and sales of ambisome and a worldwide right to use the tlc patent and the tlc patent collectively  the tlc patents 
the company originally initiated legal proceedings on may   when it filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of delaware against tlc asking the court to declare the tlc patent invalid  unenforceable and not infringed following allegations by tlc that ambisome infringes the tlc patent because of the manner in which it is freeze dried 
the united states district court for the district of delaware stayed the lawsuit pending the outcome of a reexamination of the tlc patent instituted by tlc in the us patent and trademark office uspto 
on july   certain amended claims were allowed by the uspto 
the stay was lifted on july  and an amended complaint was filed by the company on july  on august   tlc answered the amended complaint and filed a counterclaim against the company for damages and an injunction based on infringement of the reexamined patent 
on january   tlc filed an amended complaint asserting that the company s method of lyophilizing ambisome also infringed the tlc patent  which was granted by the uspto to tlc on november  the tlc patent and the tlc patent cover essentially the same subject matter 
on february   the company filed an amended and supplemental complaint asserting antitrust and business tort actions against tlc 
the amended complaint stated that tlc had fraudulently obtained the tlc patents by withholding information from  and intentionally misleading  the uspto and had attempted to use the tlc patents in order to injure nexstar pharmaceuticals and competition generally  including attempting to affect the company s proposed stock offering in june in connection with the settlement agreement  the parties dismissed all claims 
in addition  the company had opposed the grant to tlc of the european and japanese patents that are counterparts of the tlc patents 
tlc initiated legal actions against the company on october  in the chancery division of the patents court in the united kingdom  on november  in the regional court of the hague  the netherlands and on october  in the regional court dusseldorf in germany for alleged infringement of the respective national counterparts to the tlc patents 
in connection with each suit  tlc sought an injunction and damages 
in connection with the settlement agreement  the three european lawsuits were dismissed and the company withdrew its opposition in the european and japanese patent offices to the grant of the applicable counterparts to the tlc patents 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities position at december  was million compared to million on december  the million increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities position was primarily the result of the following net loss  depreciation and amortization  accrued patent litigation settlement and related expenses  other non cash items  working capital  net cash used in operating activities  investment in property  plant and equipment  proceeds from sale of investment in life science enterprise  payments on short term borrowings  net  proceeds from sale leaseback transactions  payments on capital lease obligations  proceeds from issuance of long term debt  repayments on long term debt  proceeds from issuance of convertible subordinated debentures  net  proceeds from sale of common stock  net  other  total increase in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  the company invests its cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities in interest bearing investment grade securities 
the company s accounts receivable balance at december  was million as compared to million on december  the growth in receivables was primarily due to increased sales of ambisome and proportionately increased sales of the company s products in countries in which payments tend to be slower than the average payment periods historically experienced by the company 
payment practices vary significantly between countries and increased sales in countries in which payments tend to be slower  often as a result of the pace at which governmental entities reimburse the company s customers  have in the past increased  and in the future may increase  the average length that accounts receivable are outstanding and may increase the financial risk of certain of the company s customers 
in particular  the company s greek distributor has historically been slow in making payments to the company because of the slowness of government funded institutions in making payments to it 
during the fourth quarter of  the greek government issued bonds as payment for many of the accounts which it owed to pharmaceutical companies 
in connection with the bond issuance  the company s greek distributor repaid million of accounts receivable to the company in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter through march  however  the amount of accounts receivable owed to the company by the greek distributor and certain governmental entities remains significant 
the company continually seeks improvements in its collection process to maximize its cash flow from product sales in a timely manner

as of december   million was available under agreements relating to the financing of manufacturing equipment  general laboratory and scientific equipment  office equipment  furniture and fixtures and facility improvements 
in june  the company sold all of its holdings in a life science enterprise for million following that entity s initial public offering 
as a result of the sale  the company recorded a loss of  in addition  for the year ended december   the company had a non cash expense of million related to the write off of capitalized purchased technology which the company had been amortizing over a four year period  but which the company has decided not to pursue 
during the third quarter of  the company completed the sale of million of convertible subordinated debentures due the debentures in a private offering to sbc warburg inc and oppenheimer co  inc the initial purchasers 
the company used the net proceeds of million after deducting a commission of million received by the initial purchasers and transaction expenses of approximately  from the sale of the debentures  in part  to repay outstanding bank borrowings of the company in the principal amount of million  including repaying a the outstanding principal amount of million under a term loan the term loan  b the outstanding principal balance of million under a revolving line of credit the credit line pursuant to which the company was permitted to borrow up to million  and c the outstanding principal amount of million under a credit agreement the accounts receivable loan pursuant to which the company and certain of its subsidiaries were permitted to borrow up to million  with the borrowings being collateralized by certain of the non us accounts receivable of the company and the subsidiaries 
following the repayment of the bank borrowings  the term loan and the credit line were terminated 
in september  the company terminated the accounts receivable loan and simultaneously entered into a million unsecured line of credit the credit agreement with the same financial institution 
as of december   the company had borrowings of million under the credit agreement with an average interest rate of 
the credit agreement  which includes a foreign exchange facility  terminates on september  under the terms of the credit agreement  the company is required to maintain certain financial ratios and there are limitations on the company s ability to incur additional debt or to engage in certain significant transactions 
in march  the company substantially restructured its bank financing by a terminating an unsecured line of credit pursuant to which it had a right to borrow up to million  b entering into the accounts receivable loan and c entering into the credit line 
in may  the company s spanish subsidiary entered into an agreement to borrow up to million spanish pesetas approximately million on december  with such borrowing being secured by the subsidiary s accounts receivable 
in february  the agreement was amended to increase the amount that the subsidiary may borrow to million spanish pesetas approximately million on december  
in connection with the agreement  the company maintains million in an unrestricted account 
as of december   the subsidiary had borrowings of million spanish pesetas approximately million on december  under the agreement 
the company s spanish subsidiary has notified the lender that it will repay and terminate the loan  which is due in may  in april on august   the company and the liposome company  inc tlc reached a settlement in connection with their patent litigation 
in  the company recorded an accounting charge in connection with the settlement of million of which million represents a payment in the third quarter of and the remainder represents the net present value of all future minimum payments required to be made by the company to tlc 
see results of operations years ended december   and on september   the company completed the acquisition of a toll manufacturing facility in dublin  ireland in which a contract manufacturer had previously performed labeling and quality control release for the company s products in the european union the eu and elsewhere 
the total acquisition price was one million irish punts approximately million on september  
upon the completion of the acquisition  the company began performing its own quality control release at this facility for distribution in the eu and elsewhere 
the company anticipates significant expenditures during the first half of in connection with developing and equipping additional facilities 
the company believes that it is advisable to augment its cash in order to fund all of its activities  including potential product acquisitions 
therefore  the company will consider raising cash whenever market conditions are favorable 
such capital may be raised through additional public or private financing  as well as collaborative relationships  borrowings and other available sources 
in addition  in the course of its business  the company evaluates products and technologies held by third parties which  if acquired  could result in the development of product candidates by the company or which complement technologies currently being developed by the company 
the company expects from time to time to be involved in discussions with other entities concerning the company s potential acquisition of rights to additional pharmaceutical products 
in the event that the company acquires such products or third party technologies  the company may find it necessary or advisable to obtain additional funding 
the company s future capital requirements will be substantial and will depend on  and could increase as a result of  many factors  including progress of the company s research  drug discovery and development programs  whether the company acquires interests in products currently held by third parties  the results and costs of preclinical and clinical testing of the company s products  if developed  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  the company s success in entering into collaborative agreements  changes in collaborative research relationships  the costs associated with potential commercialization of its products  if any  including the development of additional manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities  the cost and availability of third party financing for capital expenditures  and administrative and legal expenses 
in particular  the company expects to have significant cash requirements in the near future as a result of  but not limited to  increased clinical studies which are required in order to expand the indications and markets for the company s products 
there can be no assurance that additional or sufficient financing will be available  or  if available  that it will be available on acceptable terms 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities of the company  dilution to then existing stockholders may result 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to significantly curtail one or more of its research and development programs or commercialization efforts or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others on less favorable terms than might otherwise be available 
year issue the company has completed a review of its internal computer systems and is conducting a review of the external computer systems on which it relies to determine what actions will be necessary or appropriate in connection with the year issue 
the year issue is the result of computer programs which were written using two digits rather than four to signify a year ie  the year is denoted and not 
computer programs written using only two digits may recognize the year as the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar activities 
as a result of its review  the company has determined i its internal computer systems are not materially affected by the year issue 
this is a result of a the newness of the company s computer systems most of its software is written using four digits for years  b the company s reliance primarily on personal computers and not on mainframes for most of its computing needs and c the nature of the company s business ie  the company is neither a consumer nor financial based business 
ii third parties whose computer systems may affect the company s operations  to the company s knowledge  are attempting to address their own year issues 
the company has requested  and will continue to seek  information from third party entities on which it relies  certifying that their computer systems will not negatively affect the company s operations 
the company currently relies on third party vendors in connection with much of its payroll and benefits systems 
in addition  the company could be affected by the failure of various governmental entities to appropriately address the year issue 
it is the company s belief that the costs to the company as a result of the year issue will be nominal  but no assurance can be given that there will not be some unforeseen issue  in particular  in connection with third parties computer systems  that may materially affect the company s operations 
recent events during  the company licensed the right to develop and market ambisome in japan to sumitomo pharmaceuticals co  ltd 
sumitomo 
under the terms of the license  sumitomo is required to make payments to the company if certain clinical and commercial milestones are met and to pay the company royalties on all japanese sales of ambisome 
in march  sumitomo notified the company that all of the conditions necessary for the payment of a million less taxes to be withheld of  milestone have been fulfilled 
under the terms of the license  sumitomo is also required to make a milestone payment to the company if ambisome is approved for sale in japan 
risk factors the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with information appearing elsewhere in or incorporated by reference in this report 
special note certain statements set forth below constitute forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
see special note regarding forward looking statements on page for additional factors relating to such statements 
dependence on principal product the company has relied on sales of ambisome for most of its product revenues with a substantial majority of those sales occurring in european countries 
a reduction in demand for  or revenues from  ambisome or the failure to obtain additional regulatory approvals could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
regulatory approvals will be needed to expand the indications for which ambisome may be marketed in the countries where it is already approved 
there can be no assurance as to whether or when such approvals will be obtained 
see business clinical trials  preclinical trials and regulatory status ambisome in part i of this report 
the company has only one other product  daunoxome  that has received regulatory approvals 
sales to date for daunoxome have been limited and there can be no assurance as to the volume of sales that will be achieved 
the company will seek to expand the market for daunoxome by obtaining approvals for indications in addition to kaposi s sarcoma 
however  there can be no assurance that the drug will be effective for the treatment of other diseases or that such additional approvals will be obtained 
see business clinical trials  preclinical trials and regulatory status daunoxome in part i of this report 
the company has one other product that has reached the clinical development stage  mikasome  for which phase ii clinical trials have been initiated in the united states 
while the results of animal and phase i clinical trials have been encouraging  those results may not be indicative of efficacy  and further clinical trials with mikasome may not achieve the desired result  may reveal unduly harmful side effects or may show the drug to be less efficacious than other drug entities or delivery systems for the desired indication 
no assurance can be given that mikasome will be more effective than existing drugs or other technologies that may be developed in the future or that mikasome will reach commercialization or be accepted by the medical community 
see business clinical trials  preclinical trials and regulatory status mikasome in part i of this report 
the company s other potential products that are based on liposomal or other technologies are in development  and there can be no assurance that such potential products will be successfully developed  achieve therapeutic efficacy  be approved by regulatory authorities or be successfully marketed 
nor can there be any assurance that the company will be able to develop any additional products  that the approval of its current products will not be revoked or that named patient purchases will be permitted to continue in countries that have not granted approval for ambisome or daunoxome 
technological uncertainty a significant portion of the company s research is focused upon the discovery and development of novel pharmaceuticals based upon oligonucleotides 
there can be no assurance that any of the company s approaches to drug discovery will result in commercially successful drugs 
although the company has demonstrated an ability to efficiently identify oligonucleotides that bind with high affinity to and inhibit selected molecular targets  the company has not successfully demonstrated the efficacy of such oligonucleotides as human therapeutic agents  nor have any human clinical trials been initiated with products based upon such oligonucleotides 
there remain numerous challenges which the company must address to successfully develop commercial products from the drug candidates which it identifies through its selex or parallel selex processes 
these challenges include developing and implementing appropriate clinical protocols and developing manufacturing methods which are efficient  cost effective and capable of meeting stringent regulatory standards 
in addition  although many targets with potential therapeutic significance have already been identified  there can be no assurance that the targets selected by the company will ultimately prove to have the requisite medical significance such that a compound binding tightly to such target will prove to be a useful pharmaceutical product 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully address any of these or other challenges that may arise in the course of its research and development 
in addition to developing products based on its liposome  selex process and parallel selex process technologies  the company has a longer term strategy of providing pharmaceuticals to treat patients with cancer  infectious diseases and hematological disorders 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing marketable products using its technologies or will have the scientific or financial resources necessary to develop all of the potential drug candidates or technologies which its scientists may discover or the company may acquire

risk of currency fluctuations a substantial majority of the company s product sales have occurred in europe with of the company s product sales for the year ending december  occurring in the united kingdom  germany  italy and spain 
in most significant european markets  the company prices ambisome and daunoxome in the currency of the country in which such products are sold 
accordingly  the prices of such products in us dollars will vary as the value of the us dollar fluctuates against such local currencies 
increases in the value of the us dollar against such currencies  as occurred during  may reduce the us dollar return to the company on the sale of its products 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that significant additional fluctuations in foreign currency values will not occur that will create substantial differences in the relative prices of the company s products in different countries 
in addition  although the company implements hedging techniques with respect to its foreign currency accounts receivable and accounts payable  these techniques do not eliminate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations with respect to anticipated revenues  and therefore the company s future results will continue to be affected by foreign currency fluctuations 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
history of losses  future capital needs the company has incurred substantial losses during its history 
at december   the company s accumulated deficit was million 
there can be no assurance that the company will ever achieve or maintain profitability 
in addition  the company s earnings have historically not been sufficient to cover its fixed charges from operations 
earnings not taking into account the effect of taxes were deficient by million  million  million and million for each of the years ended december    and  respectively 
additionally  the company s future capital needs will be substantial and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain the capital necessary to fund all of its necessary or advisable operations 
in the event of a change in control of the company or the company s common stock no longer being listed or approved for trading on a national exchange or an over the counter market collectively  a repurchase event  the holders of the company s million of convertible subordinated debentures due the debentures can require the company to repurchase the debentures 
if a repurchase event occurs  the company may have insufficient cash with which to repurchase the debentures

reliance on proprietary rights the company s success depends in part on its ability to continue to obtain patent protection in the united states and other countries for its technologies and the products  if any  resulting from the application of such technologies 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms  including the company  are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
the company intends to continue to file applications as appropriate for patents covering its technologies and any products resulting from the application of such technologies 
no assurance can be given that patents will issue from any of the company s applications or that patents will issue in connection with technology licensed by the company or  if patents do issue  that the claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect the company s proprietary rights  that such patents will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted pursuant to such patents will provide competitive advantages to the company 
the commercial success of the company will also depend in part on the company not infringing patents or proprietary rights of third parties nor breaching any technology licenses that relate to the company s technologies and products 
a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and research and academic institutions have developed technologies  filed patent applications or received patents on various technologies that may be related to the company s business 
in addition  such entities may file applications for or be issued future patents with respect to technology potentially necessary or useful to the company 
the company is aware of third parties that have filed patent applications with claims allegedly covering technologies similar to the basic aspects of the company s liposomal technology and selex process 
some of these technologies  applications or patents may conflict with the company s technologies and existing or future patents  if any  or patent applications 
such conflict could limit the scope of the patents that nexstar pharmaceuticals has obtained or may be able to obtain or result in the company s patent applications failing to issue as patents 
in addition  if patents that cover the company s activities are issued to other companies  there can be no assurance that nexstar pharmaceuticals would be able to obtain licenses to these patents at a reasonable cost  or at all  or be able to develop or obtain alternative technology 
in addition  as more patents are issued to third parties  the risk increases that the company s products may give rise to claims that they infringe the patents of others 
see business patents  trade secrets and licenses in part i of this report 
litigation risks related to proprietary rights the company believes that its patents and patent applications are soundly based  but the extent of protection may vary in different countries 
no assurance can be given that any patent will provide commercially significant protection or will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
litigation could be necessary to protect the company s patent position  which would result in substantial cost to  and diversion of efforts by  the company 
additionally  a number of other patents have issued to other persons  some to competitors  relating to technology similar to that used by the company 
both the company and certain of its competitors have filed oppositions against each other as to patents granted by the european patent office and patents granted by the japanese patent office 
the liposome company  inc tlc and the university of california each have patents or patent applications relating to active drug loading techniques that the owners could claim are used in the manufacture of products such as daunoxome 
the company has opposed the grant of a european and a japanese patent owned by tlc and is involved in an interference proceeding with a us patent application owned by the university of california relating to such loading technology 
competitors or other patent holders could bring legal actions against the company involving the company s patents  patent applications or rights to use proprietary technology 
if any actions are successful  in addition to any potential liability for damages  the company could be enjoined from selling the affected product  or be required to obtain a license in order to continue to manufacture or market the product 
there can be no assurance that the company would prevail in any such action or that any license required under any such patent would be made available on acceptable terms  if at all 
there has been  and the company believes that there will continue to be  significant litigation in the pharmaceutical industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
any additional litigation could consume a substantial portion of the company s resources regardless of the outcome

manufacturing risks the manufacture of ambisome and daunoxome involves a number of technical steps and requires meeting stringent quality control specifications imposed by government regulatory bodies and by the company itself 
additionally  such products can only be manufactured in facilities that comply with applicable regulatory standards 
consequently  the company may be unable to quickly and efficiently replace its manufacturing capacity in the event that it cannot manufacture its products at one or more of its facilities 
in the event of a natural disaster including an earthquake  equipment failure  strike or other difficulty  the company may be unable to manufacture its products in a manner necessary to fulfill the demand for the products 
the company depends on single suppliers for high quality amphotericin b  daunorubicin hcl and high quality cholesterol  each of which is used in the company s manufacture of its liposome products 
additional suppliers of these components are presently under evaluation 
if any of these materials becomes unavailable from its respective supplier  the company would be unable to manufacture at least some of its liposome products until alternative sources of supply are obtained and the substitution of such replacement supplies has been granted by the appropriate regulatory authorities 
the company believes that alternative supplies of such materials are or will become available at reasonable prices 
however  no assurance as to the availability of such supplies can be given 
while the company has experience in manufacturing drug products based on liposome technologies  it lacks experience in the manufacture of other pharmaceuticals  including oligonucleotide based products 
the company has leased  square feet and  square feet of space in boulder  colorado for use as a bulk pharmaceutical manufacturing facility and as a development lab and scale up facility  respectively  in connection with compounds derived using the selex process 
the manufacturing facility has not been validated for the production of any product and there can be no assurance that it will ultimately obtain current good manufacturing practices status 
the company has not yet determined which  if any  drug substances it will attempt to develop or produce at the facilities  and there is no assurance that any drug substance selected for development and or production at the facilities will be suitable for production on a larger scale 
to the extent that the company s current facilities are unsuitable for the manufacture on an adequate scale of new drug substances developed by the company  the company will need to develop additional facilities or contract with third parties for the manufacture of drug substances  if any  that it may develop for its own account or in connection with collaborative arrangements in which it has retained manufacturing rights 
if the company is unable to develop needed manufacturing facilities or to obtain or retain third party manufacturing on acceptable terms  the company s ability to conduct preclinical and clinical testing will be adversely affected and it will be unable to obtain regulatory approval for or supply commercial quantities of products it may successfully develop 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in the further development of its manufacturing capabilities for its potential products 
see business manufacturing  business government regulation and properties in part i of this report 
in the fourth quarter of  the company established a new business unit  nexstar technology products ntp  to market specialty chemicals and process technologies  as well as to manufacture any oligonucleotide based drugs that might be developed by the company 
to date  ntp s sales have been limited and no assurance can be given that ntp will ever achieve substantial revenues or profits or that it will be able to successfully compete against similar businesses 
in addition  ntp s success is expected to depend significantly upon the further development of the company s product anchored sequential synthesis pass technology for synthesizing oligonucleotides 
no assurance can be given that the pass technology will ultimately prove successful in the economic large scale manufacture of oligonucleotides  including drugs developed by the company  if any  or that other technologies developed by other entities will not prove to be more commercially successful 
marketing risks the company has formed a network of subsidiaries in europe and a subsidiary in australia to promote and sell its products 
the company has also entered into a number of agreements with distributors for the promotion  sale and or distribution of ambisome and daunoxome 
for some of these distributors  the company s products represent a significant percentage of total sales 
the company competes with many other companies that currently have extensive and well funded marketing and sales operations 
there can be no assurance that either the company s marketing or sales efforts will compete successfully against other companies 
see business marketing and business competition in part i of this report 
the company s rights to market ambisome are subject to an agreement between the company and fujisawa usa  inc fujisawa 
under the terms of the agreement  as amended  the company has the marketing rights to ambisome in all countries except the united states and canada  subject to the company s obligation to pay royalties in connection with sales in most significant asian markets  including japan 
additionally  the company and fujisawa co promote ambisome in the united states and the company manufactures ambisome for sale in the us the company is reimbursed for the cost of the product sold to fujisawa and receives of the gross profits from the sales of ambisome in the united states 
in the event that the company and fujisawa are unable to cooperate in connection with the promotion of the product  the company s potential revenues from the sale of ambisome in the us may be substantially reduced

uncertainty of health care reimbursement the company s ability to commercialize its current and any future products depends in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of such products and related treatments are available from government health agencies  private health insurers and other third party payers 
payers are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products  and there can be no assurance that adequate third party coverage will be available for the company to obtain satisfactory price levels for its products 
government and other third party payers are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by a variety of means  including limiting both the degree of coverage including limiting payment for off label uses and the level of reimbursement for therapeutic products or new indications for therapeutic products 
in addition  the company s ability to sell a product in certain countries may depend on such product being included  or continuing to be included  on a government approved reimbursement list 
in january  the greek government stated that it will reduce by approximately the number of drugs for which it is willing to provide reimbursement for pharmacy level purchases beginning april  ambisome is among the products to be deleted from this reimbursement list 
since ambisome is sold directly to greek hospitals  which are not affected by the government s action  the company does not expect greek sales of ambisome to be significantly affected 
however  the company is actively attempting to have ambisome reincluded as a reimbursable drug to pharmacies in greece  and no assurance can be given that this action by the greek government or any future actions will not affect ambisome sales 
if adequate coverage and reimbursement levels are not provided by government and third party payers for use of the company s existing and potential products  the market acceptance of these products would be adversely affected 
pricing constraints the company is subject to the risk of parallel imports  governmental regulation of prices and potential price competition 
under european union eu laws  the company is limited in its ability to restrict the distributors of its products and third parties from selling the company s products in other countries when customers from such other countries offer to buy the product from such distributors or third parties 
differing product prices among countries occur in part because many foreign countries require regulatory approval of prices 
in particular  certain countries will condition their approval of a product on the agreement of the seller not to sell that product for more than a certain price in the country 
there can be no assurance that any regulatory action reducing the price of ambisome or daunoxome in any one country will not have the practical effect of requiring the company to correspondingly reduce its prices in other countries as a result of government mandated price reductions or price pressures due to parallel importing 
additionally  the price set for one of the company s products in a given country for competitive reasons may affect that product s prices worldwide 
the company has significant sales in eu countries which are expected to replace their currencies with a unified currency 
the implementation of this unified currency could lead to more unified prices in these countries which could have the effect of lowering the average sales price for the company s products 
if the company is successful in developing additional products or obtaining approval for additional indications for its current drugs  the company may also face increased price competition from potential competitors  including european based companies

potential product liability claims and uninsured risks although the company is not currently a party to any product liability litigation  the use of any of the company s products or potential products in clinical trials and the sale of such products may expose the company to liability claims 
these claims may be made directly by consumers  health care providers  pharmaceutical companies or others selling such products 
while the company currently has liability insurance in amounts that it believes to be adequate for its business as currently conducted  such insurance is expensive and may be difficult or impossible to obtain in the future 
in the event liability insurance becomes unobtainable  the company s ability to clinically test and to market its products could be significantly impaired 
moreover  the amount and scope of any coverage may be inadequate to protect the company in the event of a successful product liability claim 
as additional products are approved in the us and to the extent of the growth in sales by nexstar technology products in the united states  the company will have significantly greater risk in connection with product liability claims due to the greater frequency of lawsuits and higher damages awarded in courts in the united states as opposed to most other countries 
the company is required by governmental regulations to test its products even after they have been sold and used by patients 
as a result of such tests  the company may be required to  or may determine that  it should recall products when most of such products have already been sold or used 
such later testing and product recalls may increase the company s potential exposure to product liability claims

reliance on relationships the company has entered into collaborative arrangements pursuant to which other companies are entitled to certain product  manufacturing  marketing and or royalty rights  including collaborative arrangements relating to aspects of the selex process 
although the agreements with these companies provide for the funding by such companies of certain research and development efforts conducted by the company  such funding may be terminated by such companies under certain circumstances 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that any of the company s current collaborative arrangements will be successful 
the company may seek future collaborative relationships with corporate partners to fund certain research and development expenses and to develop and commercialize certain of its potential products 
further  the company s receipt of revenues from collaborative agreements will be affected by the timing of efforts expended by the company under existing agreements  as well as by the timing of drug development programs of the company s collaborators 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to negotiate acceptable collaborative arrangements in the future  or that such collaborative arrangements will be successful 
to the extent that the company elects not to or is unable to establish such relationships it could incur increased capital expenditures as it is required to undertake research  development  marketing and manufacturing of its proposed products at its own expense 
in addition  there can be no assurance that existing or future collaborative partners will have sufficient economic motivation to continue their funding or to develop any products to which they may have rights  or that such partners will not pursue alternative technologies or attempt to develop alternative compounds either independently or in collaboration with others
