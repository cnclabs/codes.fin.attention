income loss from discontinued operations net income loss general market conditions the company operates exclusively in the semiconductor capital equipment market  which went into a downturn beginning in early fiscal  and intensified throughout the remainder of the fiscal year 
the downturn was provoked by the economic crisis in southeast asia  where much of the company s equipment is sold and used 
these market and economic conditions have adversely impacted the company s net sales and operating results for fiscal  and are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on the company s sales and operating results until the market conditions improve significantly 
as a result of the current and projected market downturn  the company initiated cost reduction actions and adjusted its reserve assumptions in the fourth quarter of fiscal  recording inventory and other charges of million 
of these charges  million represented a provision for excess and obsolete inventory  reflected in cost of sales 
the remainder of the charges  reflected mainly in operating expenses  primarily related to cost reduction activities initiated by the company and other related adjustments in assumptions 
fiscal years ended june  and june  net sales 
net sales for fiscal year were million  an increase of over million in fiscal year sales of the handler  introduced in mid fiscal  and the handler increased in the current year while sales of older handler and tester products decreased in the current year as compared to fiscal the product mix shift from older products to newer products has been precipitated by the current downturn in the semiconductor capital equipment market 
as detailed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  sales increased year to year in the us and europe  but decreased in the far east 
the increase in sales in the us and europe resulted from an increased customer base in these areas 
the decline in sales in the far east resulted from the deterioration in the economic conditions in the southeast asian countries where the company s products are sold 
the company expects sales to continue to be adversely affected by the downturn in the semiconductor capital equipment market  most notably in older products  well into fiscal in addition  the company expects that the current market conditions will lead to increased competition  putting pressure on pricing and sales terms 
gross profit 
gross profit in fiscal decreased or million to million from million in fiscal  and gross margin decreased to in fiscal from in the previous year  primarily as a result the previously discussed inventory and other charges in fiscal prior to these charges  fiscal gross profit was million and gross margin was  reflecting slightly higher sales offset by product mix shift to lower margin products 
quarterly gross margins decreased during fiscal to approximately in the third and fourth quarters  prior to inventory and other charges  as a result of a shift in product mix away from some of the older  higher margin products to lower margin products 
the company expects gross margins in the near future to be consistent with the levels experienced near the end of fiscal in addition  the company anticipates that pricing pressure will intensify in the current market conditions  which may further adversely affect gross margins

these efforts are allowing the company to enter market segments and attract customers not previously served by the company 
however  the success of the new products  such as the  and products  as well as any potential product offering in the future  is subject to various risks and uncertainties  including customer acceptance  fluctuations in the semiconductor market  technology changes and the possible adverse impact of competition

adopting the provisions of sfas are not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
the standard is effective for the company in fiscal year compliance many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
when year begins  these computers may interpret as the year and could either stop processing date related computations or could process them incorrectly 
beginning in the year  these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates to be year compliant 
the company has completed an initial assessment of its internal information systems and has determined that most of the application software and and internal information systems  other than the company s primary manufacturing and accounting system are year compliant  can be upgraded to be year compliant without significant cost or effort  or  do not pose a significant issue to the company if left uncorrected 
with regard to the company s primary manufacturing and accounting system  the company has contracted with the software vendor and related hardware supplier to bring these systems compliant prior to the end of fiscal the upgrade process began in the th quarter of fiscal  and approximately of the up front costs have been paid to date 
total costs to upgrade the company s internal information systems are not material to the operations of the company  and are expected to be less than  the company is in the process of assessing non it systems within the company to determine if they are year compliant 
the company expects to have the assesment completed by the end of although the company is not aware of any material operational issues or costs associated with preparing its internal systems for the year  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience serious unanticipated negative consequences and or material costs caused by undetected errors or defects in the technology used in its internal operating systems  which are composed predominately of third party software and hardware technology 
the company is in the process of determining the impact those parties that are not year compliant may have on the operations of the company 
non compliance by any of the company s major distributors  suppliers  customer  vendors  or financial organizations could result in business disruptions that could have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
the company plans on developing a contingency plan once it has completed its assessment of significant party compliance 
the contingency plan will be developed to minimize the company s exposure to work slowdowns or business disruptions and any adverse affects on the company s results of operations 
the contingency plan should be completed by the end of the company is currently in the process of assessing and testing the software components of its products for year compliance 
the company does not believe that its products contain undetected errors or defects associated with year date functions that may result in material costs to the company  including repair costs and costs incurred in litigation due to any such defects  however  there can be no assurance that such errors or defects do not exist 
many commentators have stated that a significant amount of litigation will arise out of year compliance issues 
because of the unprecedented nature of such litigation  there can be no assurance that the company will not be materially adversely affected by claims related to year compliance
