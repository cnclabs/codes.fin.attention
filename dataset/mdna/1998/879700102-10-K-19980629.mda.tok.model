see factors that may affect future results below and cautionary statements appearing under item business and elsewhere in this form k for a discussion of the important factors affecting the realization of those results 
overview for fiscal  the company recorded income before the cumulative effect of an accounting change of million or per share 
this compares to a net loss of million or 
per share for fiscal inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s consolidated results of operations 
the company operates in a rapidly changing and dynamic market  and the company s strategies and plans are designed to adapt to changing market conditions where and when possible 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s management will identify the risks especially those newly emerging from time to time affecting  and their impact on  the company and its business  that the company s strategies and plans will take into account all market conditions and changes thereto or that such strategies and plans will be successfully implemented 
accordingly  neither the historical results presented in the company s consolidated financial statements and discussed herein  nor any forward looking statements in this form k  are necessarily indicative of the company s future results 
see factors that may affect future results for a discussion of risk factors which may affect the company s future results of operations 
factors that may affect future results the risks and other important factors which may affect the company s business  operating results  and financial and other conditions include  without limitation  the following the company s results of operations are affected by a variety of factors  including economic conditions generally both domestic and foreign as well as those specific to the industry in which it competes  decreases in average selling price over the life of any particular product  the timing  manufacturing complexity and expense of new product introductions both by the company and its competitors  the timely implementation of new manufacturing technologies  the ability to safeguard patents and other intellectual property in a rapidly evolving market  the rapid increase in demand for some products and the rapid decline in demand for others and the company s ability to anticipate and plan for that changing market demand 
certain of these factors are beyond the company s control 
historically  the company s shipments during any particular quarter generally represent orders received either during that quarter or shortly before the beginning of that quarter 
the company endeavors to maintain sufficient levels of purchased components to meet the delivery requirements of its customers  but there can be no assurance that during any given quarter  the company has or can procure the appropriate mix of purchased components to accommodate such orders 
therefore  the company s financial performance in any quarter is dependent to a significant degree upon obtaining orders which can be manufactured and delivered to its customers in that quarter 
as a result  financial performance for any given quarter cannot be known or fully assessed until near the end of that quarter 
the company has also historically recognized a substantial portion of its product revenues in the last month of each quarter 
a significant portion of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  and timing of increases in such expenses is based in large part on the company s forecast of future revenues 
as a result  if revenues do not meet expectations  the company may be unable to quickly adjust expenses to levels appropriate to actual revenues  which could have a materially adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company s sales efforts have increasingly been focused on sales  both by the company directly and though oems  vars  isvs and other indirect sales channels  of complete data transaction systems rather than on sales of handheld computer products alone 
system sales tend to be more costly and  therefore  require a longer selling cycle  longer payment terms and more complex integration and installation services 
the markets in which the company competes are intensely competitive and characterized by increasingly rapid technological change  introduction of new products with improved performance characteristics  product obsolescence and price erosion 
failure to keep pace with product and technological advances could negatively affect the company s competitive position and prospects for growth 
customers anticipation of new or enhanced product offerings by the company or a competitor may lead them to defer purchases of the company s existing products 
in addition  companies that are participants in the broader computer industry are potential competitors 
some of the company s competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  intellectual property  marketing and human resources than the company 
the company s future success depends on its ability to develop and rapidly bring to market technologically advanced products 
from time to time the company invests in development stage and other entities who possess or who could potentially possess strategically important technologies 
due to the nature of these entities and their operations  there can be no assurance that these investments will be realizable or will result in marketable and or successful products 
there can be no assurance that the company s research and development activities will lead to the commercially successful introduction of new or improved products or that the company will not encounter delays or problems in connection with those products 
the cost of perfecting new and improved technologies to satisfy customer quality and delivery expectations as they are brought to market cannot always be fully anticipated and may adversely affect company operating profits during such introductions 
in addition  the average selling prices for computer products generally decrease over the products lives 
to mitigate such decreases  the company seeks to reduce manufacturing costs of existing products and to introduce new products  functions and other price performance enhancing features 
to the extent that these product enhancements do not occur on a timely basis or do not result in a sufficient increase in sales prices to end users  the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected 
to date  the company s revenues have been concentrated in the retail industry  historically representing over of its total revenues 
among other factors  the economic condition and prospects of current and prospective customers in the markets which the company serves may affect the company s own financial results 
the company s future growth depends  in part  on its ability to successfully penetrate and expand its revenues in new markets as well as increased penetration in the retail market 
there can be no assurance that penetration and expansion into new and existing markets can be profitably achieved 
the company believes its future success is also dependent  in part  upon its ability to continue to enhance its product offerings through internal development and the acquisition of new businesses and technologies  but there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify  acquire or profitably operate new businesses or otherwise implement its growth strategy successfully 
for the company to manage its growth and integrate any newly acquired entities  it must continue to improve operations and financial and management information systems and effectively motivate and manage employees 
if the company is unable to successfully pursue and manage such growth  its business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
the company regards certain of its hardware and software technologies as proprietary and relies on a combination of united states and foreign patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as license and other contractual confidentiality provisions  to protect its proprietary rights 
despite the company s efforts to safeguard its proprietary rights  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in doing so or that the company s competitors will not independently develop or patent technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to or otherwise circumvent the company s technologies and proprietary rights 
the company s products utilize hardware and software technologies licensed from third parties 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to license needed technology in the future 
an early termination of certain of these license agreements including patent rights licensed from symbol technologies  inc  one of its principal competitors  necessary for the company s manufacture and sale of its integrated laser scanning terminals which account for a material portion of the company s current sales could have a materially adverse effect on the company s ability to market certain of its products and  hence  on its business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company believes that its products  processes and trademarks do not infringe on the rights of third parties  but third parties have asserted  and there can be no assurance that they will not in the future assert  infringement or other related claims against the company or its licensors 
any infringement claim or related litigation against the company  or any challenge to the validity of the company s own intellectual property rights  and the expense of defending the same could materially adversely effect the company s ability to market its products and  hence  its business  results of operations and financial condition 
certain of the company s products  sub assemblies and components are procured from single source suppliers  and others are procured from only a limited number of suppliers 
the company has in the past encountered  and may in the future encounter  shortages of supplies and delays in deliveries of products  sub assemblies and components from its third party suppliers 
such shortages and delays  or should any third party supplier become unable or unwilling to supply such items to the company consistent with the company s volume and quality requirements  on the company s ability to ship products  and  in turn  its business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
as a substantial portion of the company s total revenues  ranging from approximately in recent years  is from customers located outside of the united states  the company s results could be negatively affected by global and regional economic conditions  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  trade protection measures  regulatory acceptance of the company s products in foreign countries  longer accounts receivable collection patterns and other considerations peculiar to the conduct of international business 
additionally  the company is subject to similar risks in its procurement of certain of its products  components and sub assemblies outside the united states 
as a particular instance  the financial press has widely reported the significant economic difficulties being experienced by a number of asian economies 
while the company s cost of doing business in the affected countries has declined as a result of those difficulties  the revenues derived from such countries are likely to be adversely affected by those difficulties 
since sales to asia have historically not been material in amount  the company does not believe that the economic difficulties in asia of the nature  scope and extent recently experienced will have a material adverse effect of the company s results of operations 
however  in the event of a significant adverse change in asian business conditions due to government economic regulation  civil unrest or otherwise  or should the economic difficulties in such countries spread or have an adverse impact of business activities in north america  europe and or elsewhere in the world  the company s results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
certain of the company s products intentionally transmit radio signals as part of their normal operation 
these products are subject to regulatory approval  restrictions on the use of certain frequencies and the creation of interference  and other requirements by the federal communications commission and corresponding authorities in each country in which they are marketed 
regulatory changes could significantly impact the company s operations by restricting the company s development efforts  making current products obsolete or increasing the opportunity for additional competition 
the intentional emission of electromagnetic radiation has also been the subject of recent public concern regarding possible health and safety risks  and though the company believes that the low power output and the distance typically maintained between a product and the user means that its products do not pose material safety concerns  there can be no assurance that such safety issues will not arise in the future and will not have a materially adverse effect on the company s business 
among other things  the company s future success depends in large part on the continued service of its key technical  marketing and management personnel and on its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees  particularly those highly skilled design  process and test engineers involved in the manufacture of existing products and the development of products and processes 
the competition for such personnel is intense  and the loss of key employees could have a materially adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to the factors discussed above and elsewhere in this form k which may adversely affect the company s conduct of its business and the results thereof  the company s financial condition is also subject to the possible adverse effects of certain pending litigation and other contingencies discussed above under item legal proceedings  and in note to the financial statements included below in item in this form k 
readiness for the year customary computer programming practices  developed prior to the upcoming change in the century becoming a concern  have used two digits rather than four to identify the year in date fields 
if not corrected  many computer applications may fail to treat year dates intended to represent years in the twenty first century as such but instead treat them as still in the twentieth century  potentially resulting in system failure or miscalculations disruptive of business operations  including  among other things  an inability to initiate  receive  process  invoice or otherwise complete normal business activities 
these year issues affect virtually all companies and organizations 
the year issues affect both the company s own internal operations and the computer products and related services it provides 
as further discussed under financial condition cash flows from investing activities below  the company is working with outside contractors to develop and install a new corporate wide information system 
the new system was identified as a strategic business initiative independent of year considerations 
while the new information system will be a dynamic one permitting ongoing improvements as business needs are identified  the basic operational systems are expected to be substantially completed during early at a total estimated capital expenditure of approximately million 
those time and cost targets are management s current best estimates based on presently available information and numerous assumptions 
given the uncertainties and complexities inherent in any new system installation  there can be no assurance that the project will be completed within the expected time and cost parameters 
the portions of the company s existing information system which would require correction for year issues will be superseded as part of this larger  new system installation  which is being designed to be year ready 
with respect to its own products  the company has identified those of its existing products released prior to december  that are or will be made year ready 
those already or to be made year ready products represent the existing products which management believes will continue to be a significant part of the company s ongoing product line 
customers may continue to order the company s other existing products  but with no assurance from the company as to their year readiness or the feasibility or availability of an upgrade path to readiness 
all new products released after december   will be year ready when released 
the company has substantially completed the initial writing of the software firmware upgrades for the existing products which are not presently  but are to be made year ready  and has completed a majority of the testing of those upgrades 
subject to negotiated contractual commitments  the company will make the upgrades available free of charge for products purchased after december   but customers will be responsible for installing the upgrades or they may retain the company to do so for a fee 
given the technical nature of the task of isolating and correcting non compliant programming and the limited internal resources available  and the increasing demand for available external resources  to perform the work  there can be no assurance as to if  when and at what cost the upgrades can be completed 
the company could be adversely affected by the year readiness of its customers as well as of its suppliers of raw materials  components  peripherals  finished products and software and its providers of facilities  equipment and services and any failure on their part to achieve readiness in their own operations or with respect to the items they supply or otherwise provide to the company 
while the company is in the process of determining what inquiries might be appropriate to make of such other parties principally of its suppliers and other providers in these regards  there can be no assurance that the year issues confronting such other parties and any failure on their part to timely address them will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues could also materially adversely affect the company 
results of operations revenues vs 
the table below sets forth the consolidated net revenues of the company for fiscal and  without adjustments for the sale of its former itronix corporation itronix subsidiary  which was effective december  as further explained below  after adjusting fiscal revenues to exclude the itronix operations  consolidated revenues from the company s continuing operations increased million or  as compared to fiscal year ended march  increase decrease dollar percentage in thousands product  net    customer service  net    total net revenues   nm product revenues include the sale of portable tele transaction computers ptcs  including rugged  wireless mobile computers and pen based and touch screen workslates  hardware accessories  wireless data communication products  custom application software and software licenses  and a variety of professional services  including system integration and project management 
consolidated product revenues from continuing operations increased million or during fiscal as compared to fiscal the reported results of fiscal included million of product revenues recorded by itronix 
the increase in consolidated product revenues was due to a increase in consolidated volume with a reduction in the average selling price per ptc unit 
the increase in consolidated volume was comprised of a increase in non pen based units  reflecting continued growth in customers demand for the company s newer  more sophisticated units  and a increase in pen based unit volume  the result of the company s development and increased market penetration of its more powerful workslate models 
the company expects increased consolidated product revenues in fiscal the million or increase in consolidated customer service revenue from continuing operations during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to the continued increase in the installed base of the company s products  in turn generating increased maintenance and time material billings 
consolidated customer service revenue  as a percentage of consolidated product revenue  has remained relatively constant  in fiscal vs 
in fiscal  illustrating the correlative relationship between consolidated customer service revenue and consolidated product revenue 
the company anticipates increased consolidated customer service revenues in fiscal the company s international operations including canada provided revenues of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
this slight decrease was the result of the million decline in canadian sales caused by the relocation of the aironet canadian operations to akron  ohio during the second and third quarters of fiscal partially offset by the million of increased revenue reported by the company s other foreign subsidiaries  primarily the company s subsidiaries in the united kingdom and germany  as well as increased sales to foreign distributors

year ended march  increase decrease dollar percentage in thousands product  net    customer service  net    total net revenues    the decrease in consolidated product revenues in fiscal from fiscal levels was due primarily to the absence in fourth quarter of product revenues from itronix as the result of the sale of that subsidiary s business at december  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  itronix recorded total product revenues of million 
the company s fiscal and consolidated product revenues  adjusted for the sale of itronix by excluding itronix total product revenues of million for the first nine months of fiscal and million for the twelve months of fiscal  amounted to million and million  respectively 
in addition to the impact of the sale of itronix  the company s fiscal product revenues were negatively impacted by a decrease in ptc unit volume that was partially offset by an increase in the average selling price per ptc unit 
the increased average selling price per ptc unit was primarily due to the increase in the company s sales volume of comprehensive wireless systems and other more complex and costly products such as pen based and touch screen workslates as a percentage of total product revenues 
the increase in consolidated customer service revenue in fiscal from fiscal levels was due primarily to the continued increase in the installed base of the company s products 
revenues from the company s international operations including canada were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
this increase was primarily attributable to increased revenues recorded by the company s australian subsidiary and certain of its canadian operations as well as increased sales to foreign distributors

the increase in cost of product revenue from continuing operations is directly related to the increase in consolidated product revenue

fiscal s consolidated product gross margin was also positively impacted by the reduced provisions for inventory obsolescence due to improved inventory management and the streamlining of the company s product offerings 
the company expects fiscal product gross margins to remain consistent with the levels recorded during fiscal consolidated inventory allowance accounts decreased to million at march   from million at march  this decrease was primarily the result of the physical disposition of million of fully reserved obsolete material during the third quarter of fiscal that had previously been identified during the streamlining of the company s product lines in fiscal  partially offset by the continued provision for inventory obsolescence

in addition to the impact of these non recurring charges  product gross margins declined from fiscal levels due to an increase in the amount of large volume low margin business and early stage rollouts of new products during fiscal included in the fiscal results were revenues related to the sale of non exclusive software licenses and manufacturing rights to a third party business partner which reduced the fiscal consolidated product revenues cost percentage by approximately 
the increase in the fiscal consolidated customer service cost percentage from fiscal levels was primarily due to non recurring charges recorded during the third quarter of fiscal as well as the increased direct material and labor costs required to repair the company s more sophisticated and complex products 
these non recurring items  which included provisions for the decreased carrying value of the company s service inventories affected by the streamlining of its product lines and charges related to the consolidation of field service operations  accounted for approximately million or of the fiscal consolidated cost of customer service revenues 
for the year ended march   inventory allowance accounts increased to million from million at march  as a percentage of gross inventories  inventory allowances increased to at march   from at march  the increase in the inventory allowance accounts as well as the increase in the allowance as a percentage of gross inventories reflects the additional provisions recorded primarily during the third quarter of fiscal in conjunction with the company s streamlining of its product lines
