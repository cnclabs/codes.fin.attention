item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general acquisition of shell properties 
on march   the company and affiliates of shell oil company collectively  shell executed a definitive merger agreement which  together with a separate purchase and sale agreement collectively referred to herein as the shell agreements and the transactions contemplated by the shell agreements are referred to herein as the shell transactions  will result in the company acquiring all of shell s producing and exploration properties in south louisiana in exchange for shares of common and convertible preferred stock representing of the common stock of the company as of the closing  assuming exercise of all stock options  warrants and conversion of the preferred stock  and million in cash 
following the shell transactions  the company is expected to control over  gross onshore acres in louisiana and texas with approximately  square miles of onshore d seismic data  which the company believes to be one of the largest positions held by a company with tmrc s market capitalization 
the company estimates that is current production base following the shell transactions will be approximately  equivalent barrels of oil per day and that proved reserves will total over million equivalent barrels of oil having an estimated reserve life of approximately six years 
the terms of the shell agreements call for shell to receive a fixed of the post transaction common stock of the company  assuming exercise of all stock options  warrants and conversion of the preferred stock  comprised of million shares of common stock and shares of a new series of preferred stock the preferred stock convertible into approximately million shares of common stock 
the preferred stock will have a stated value of million  a annual dividend for a period of five years with the dividend reducing in amount by one third in each year starting at the end of two years so that no dividends will be payable after five years and a conversion price of approximately per share 
the preferred stock will convert automatically into common stock if the market price of the common stock is greater than or equal to of the conversion price for consecutive trading days 
terms of the shell transactions are not subject to changes in the market price of the common stock 
to insure the company s ability to function as an independent oil and gas company  shell has agreed to restrict its discretionary voting rights on non extraordinary corporate issues requiring a shareholder vote to of the outstanding voting shares  with the remainder of its holdings to be voted in the same ratio as the shares voted by other shareholders and shell s unrestricted shares 
shell also has agreed to restrictions on its ability to sell shares and will be provided with certain rights to purchase additional shares to the extent necessary to maintain at least a beneficial ownership interest in the company 
shell will be entitled to one seat on the company s board of directors 
the consummation of the shell transactions is subject to approval of the shareholders of the company and certain other customary conditions 
the company currently anticipates that a closing of the shell transactions will occur either late in the second quarter or early in the third quarter of cairn merger 
on november   the company acquired by merger the merger cairn 
in the merger  the company issued approximately million shares of common stock  par value common stock 
the merger more than doubled the company s proved reserves and substantially increased the production and cash flow of the company 
in connection with the merger  the company expanded its working capital line of credit to million and repaid all of cairn s outstanding bank debt 
the merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests and the company s historical financial statements and operating results and the discussion of such results in this management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations have been restated to reflect the combined operations of the company and cairn for the periods presented 
the company recorded a one time charge in the fourth quarter of approximately million for costs associated with the merger 
ceiling writedown and industry conditions 
the company s revenues  profitability and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for natural gas and  to a lesser extent  oil 
oil and natural gas prices have been extremely volatile in recent years and are affected by many factors outside the control of tmrc 
since  prices for west texas intermediate wti crude have ranged from to per bbl and the monthly average of the gulf coast spot market natural gas price at henry hub  louisiana  has ranged from to per mcf 
in  wti crude oil prices have ranged between to per bbl  and spot natural gas prices at henry hub  louisiana  have ranged between to per mcf 
prices received by the company for its oil production have been significantly depressed since the fourth quarter of and wti posting reached an eight year low of on march  natural gas prices have similarly declined  but on a less dramatic basis 
these declines in prices of oil and natural gas have affected the results and associated cash flow of the company s properties 
the volatile nature of the energy markets makes it difficult to estimate future prices of oil and natural gas  however  any prolonged period of depressed prices could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company follows the full cost method of accounting for its investments in oil and natural gas properties  which requires that the net carrying value of oil and natural gas properties is limited to the sum of the present value discount rate of the estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves  based on the current prices and costs  plus the lower of cost or estimated value of unproved properties 
due to prevailing market conditions as of december   the average prices utilized by the company in determining the net carrying value of its oil and natural gas properties were per mcf and per bbl  compared to per mcf and per bbl utilized to calculate such value at december  as a result of this significant decline in oil and natural gas prices  the company recognized a million non cash write down of its oil and natural gas properties under the full cost method of accounting 
since the net carrying value of the company s oil and natural gas properties have been reduced due to the full cost ceiling limitation such that the present value of the company s proved oil and gas reserves do not exceed the company s net oil and gas properties recorded on its balance sheet  there is an increased risk of future property write downs due to factors that negatively affect the present value of proved oil and gas reserves  including volatile oil and gas prices  downward revisions in estimated proved oil and natural gas quantities and unsuccessful exploratory operations 
in this regard  because prices have further declined since december   the company expects to record an additional write down during the first quarter of based upon oil and natural gas prices in effect at march   this writedown is expected to be between million and million  and further write downs are possible if market conditions do not improve 
amoco litigation 
in june  amoco production company amoco filed suit against the company in louisiana state court in calcasieu parish with respect to a dispute involving the drilling by the company of the company s ben todd no 
tmrc well in the southwest holmwood field in which the company et al and amoco each hold a leasehold interest 
the case was removed to the united states district court for the western district of louisiana in july the ben todd no 
tmrc well was drilled by the company under a participation agreement between the company and amoco in which amoco had a right to participate in the well 
the well was drilled by the company after providing notice to amoco pursuant to the participation agreement of the company s intent to drill the well and amoco s failure to take action to elect to participate in the well 
prior to the drilling of the well  the company had been advised by its advisors that the drilling of the well by the company was permitted under the participation agreement by virtue of amoco s refusal to reasonably consent to the well following tmrc s request to do so 
amoco also did not seek to enjoin the drilling of the well and accepted the benefits of the well following the drilling thereof as well as other benefits under the participation agreement or lease 
amoco alleged in its suit that the well was not permitted to be drilled under the agreement and sought to recover all the revenues from the well or have the production from the well stopped 
amoco requested that the trial court cancel the participation agreement and the company s leasehold interest in the prospect  which includes the company s interest in the ben todd no 
amoco well that was drilled prior to the ben todd no 
tmrc well on an agreed basis 
the company filed a counterclaim for breach of contract  unfair practices and other claims 
on december   the federal district court entered a judgment against the company in this matter and ordered that the company was not permitted under the participation agreement to drill the ben todd no 
tmrc well and that the participation agreement and related lease had been terminated by virtue of the company s drilling of the well 
the trial court also dismissed the company s counterclaims against amoco 
the trial court further ordered a reversion of the company s rights with respect to the ben todd no 
tmrc and the ben todd no 
amoco and directed tmrc to account for all production and monies received by it from the date of the cancellation of the lease 
the company has calculated the production and revenues received by it as operator from those properties to which the trial court has ordered to be returned to amoco to be approximately bcfe and million 
the company recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of  representing its estimated portion of the potential loss  which is net of approximately million of amounts that would be recoverable from third parties with respect to the amoco lawsuit 
management does not expect any material additional charges to be made with respect to this matter 
the company has reported no reserves related to these properties as of december  results of operations twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  operating revenues and production 
during  production remained relatively flat compared to although the company experienced production increases during attributable to the continuing increase in exploration and development activities by the company and the addition of new producing wells  those increases were offset by normal declines in oil and natural gas production from older wells as well as a significant decline in production from wells in the company s southwest holmwood field in louisiana during the third quarter of due to poor production performance from the wells in this field as well as the elimination of production from these wells during the fourth quarter of as a result of the amoco litigation described above 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  production from certain offshore wells was temporarily interrupted due to a ruptured pipeline

severance and ad valorem taxes 
severance and ad valorem taxes increased  to  in  compared to  in this increase is partially the result of increased revenues relating to increased oil production and increased natural gas prices 
in addition  severance and ad valorem taxes in were more heavily affected than in by a louisiana severance tax reduction incentive for new field discoveries and wells drilled below  feet

interest expense 
interest expense in remained relatively unchanged from levels 
interest expense was reduced by the retirement of tmrc s bank debt in late following tmrc s common stock which was offset by interest on increased borrowings under cairn s credit facility 
liquidity and capital resources working capital 
during the year ending december   the company s liquidity needs were met from oil and natural gas production sales  cash reserves and borrowings under the company s lines of credit 
as of december   the company had a cash balance of million and negative working capital of million 
the decrease in both the cash balance and working capital reflects capital expenditures related to the company s increasing exploration and development activities 
existing credit facility 
in november  the company obtained a million line of credit existing credit facility with the chase manhattan bank chase 
the company s obligations under this facility are secured by the common stock of texas meridian resources exploration  inc tmrx  the company s operating subsidiary  and certain other subsidiaries of the company and cairn s oil and natural gas properties 
under the terms of this existing credit facility  the company may borrow  on a revolving basis  up to million  subject to a borrowing base as determined from time to time by chase 
the existing credit facility contains various restrictive covenants including  among other things  certain minimum financial ratios and restrictions on cash dividends 
borrowings under the existing credit facility mature on november  under the existing credit facility  the company may secure either an alternate base rate loan  which bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the greatest of i chase s prime rate  ii a cd based rate or federal funds based rate  or a eurodollar base rate loan  which bears interest  generally  at a rate per annum equal to the rate at which chase is offered u 
s 
dollar deposits in the interbank eurodollar market plus to depending on the company s ratio of the aggregate outstanding loans and letters of credit to the borrowing base 
the existing credit facility also provides for commitment fees ranging from to per annum 
the book value of the company s floating rate debt is considered representative of its fair value 
the company utilized million under the existing credit facility to refinance cairn s outstanding indebtedness and the indebtedness under the company s prior credit facility as well as to fund expenses relating to the merger 
as a result  at december   the company had available borrowings of million under the existing credit facility following the merger 
as of march   the company had borrowed a total of million under the existing credit facility 
new credit facility 
the company has received an underwritten commitment which it has accepted the new credit facility which will replace the existing credit facility and fund ongoing operations and the cash consideration portion of the shell transactions 
the commitment provides for a total credit facility of million  with an initial borrowing base of million which is available through the closing of the shell transactions 
a borrowing base redetermination is scheduled at the earlier of the closing of the shell transactions or six months from the closing date of the new credit facility  which is currently anticipated to increase the borrowing base to at least million 
after closing  the new credit facility will bear interest at the lender s base rate plus a margin of to 
the new credit facility will be secured in the same manner as the existing credit facility and has similar covenants and conditions 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures during consisted of million for property and equipment additions related to exploration and development of various prospects  including lease  seismic data acquisitions  drilling and completion costs 
the company expects that capital expenditures for property and equipment additions may increase during  as the company funds its offshore exploration and development program 
the company currently expects capital expenditures for to be approximately million 
in addition  if the shell transactions are consummated  the company expects to expand its onshore exploration program to take advantage of opportunities associated with the properties to be acquired 
capital expenditures associated with this expansion are expected to be as much as million for these capital expenditures are expected to be funded through a combination of cash flow from the acquired properties and borrowings under a proposed expansion of the company s credit facility or other debt or equity financings 
in management s opinion  the company will have sufficient capital resources to fund its operations 
future requirements  however  will depend upon the success of the company s drilling program and the nature and extent of capital expenditures required for development of discoveries 
in that regard  the company anticipates that it may obtain additional capital through the issuance of debt  equity or convertible securities 
new accounting pronouncements reporting comprehensive income 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
sfas  reporting comprehensive income  which establishes standards for reporting and displaying of comprehensive income in the financial statements 
comprehensive income is the total of net income and all other non owner changes in equity 
adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  which is effective for years beginning after december  sfas no 
establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december   and  therefore  the company will adopt the new requirements retroactively in management has not completed its review of sfas no 
 but does not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will have a significant effect on the company s reported operations 
impact of year some of the company s computer programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  those computer programs have time sensitive software that recognizes a date using as the year rather than the year if not corrected  this could cause a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company currently is in the process of converting its information systems to be year compliant  the costs of which the company does not believe will be material 
the system conversion is estimated to be completed no later than december   however  it is possible that certain efforts will be delayed into the greatest year compliance risk is that system conversion will be delayed beyond the anticipated completion date and the severe shortage of qualified information systems personnel  both internally and externally  could affect compliance efforts 
the company believes that with conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
the estimated cost and the anticipated date of system implementation are based on management s best estimates  however  there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated
