the company s actual experience may differ materially from that anticipated in such statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in risk factors contained in exhibit hereto  as well as future events that have the effect of reducing the company s operating income and available cash balances  such as unexpected operating losses or delays in the integration of the company s seating business  the delivery of the company s mdds interactive video system  customer delivery requirements  new or expected refurbishments  or cash expenditures related to possible future acquisitions 
in thousands  except share and per share data introduction b e is the world s largest manufacturer of interior products for commercial and general aviation aircraft cabins  serving virtually all major airlines and general aviation aircraft owners and original equipment manufacturers with a broad line of products  including aircraft seats  a full line of food and beverage preparation and storage equipment  interior systems structures  oxygen delivery systems and related products  and in flight entertainment systems 
in addition  b e provides upgrade  maintenance and repair services for the products which it manufactures as well as for those supplied by other manufacturers 
b e s revenues are generally derived from two primary sources refurbishment or upgrade programs for the existing worldwide fleets of commercial and general aviation aircraft  and new aircraft deliveries 
b e believes its large installed base of products  estimated to be approximately billion valued at replacement prices as of february   gives it a significant advantage over competitors in obtaining orders for refurbishment programs  principally due to the airlines tendency to purchase equipment for such programs from the original supplier 
with the exception of spare parts sales  b e s revenues are generated from programs which may vary significantly from year to year in terms of size  mix of products and length of delivery 
as a result  b e s revenues and margins may fluctuate from period to period based upon the size and timing of the programs and the type of products sold 
historically  b e experienced certain trends in its two revenue drivers as the airlines took deliveries of large numbers of new aircraft  refurbishment programs as a percentage of revenues declined and  similarly  when new aircraft deliveries declined  refurbishment programs tended to increase in number and size 
during the most recent airline industry recession  which ended in  the airlines significantly depleted their cash reserves and incurred record losses 
in an effort to improve their liquidity  the airlines conserved cash by reducing or deferring cabin interior refurbishment and upgrade programs and purchases of new aircraft 
as a result  in contrast with historical experience  b e experienced declines in the number of both new orders and refurbishments 
since early  the airlines have experienced a significant turnaround in operating results  with the domestic airline industry achieving record operating earnings during calendar years through consequently  during fiscal  b e has experienced significant growth in backlog of seating and interior systems products  and has experienced significant growth in revenues and operating earnings 
this growth is a reflection of the airlines need to begin refurbishing worn fleets and their ability to do so as a result of the strengthening of the airlines balance sheets 
b e has substantially expanded the size  scope and nature of its business as a result of a number of acquisitions 
during the fiscal year ended february   b e completed the following acquisitions i on april   the company acquired  through a dutch holding company  all of the capital stock of inventum  a supplier of galley inserts including ovens  beverage makers and water boilers to airlines located primarily in europe and the pacific rim  ii on august   the company acquired all of the capital stock of nordskog  an industry pioneer in galley structures and inserts  iii on august   the company acquired all of the capital stock of acurex  the leading worldwide supplier of commercial aircraft refrigeration products  and iv on october   the company acquired substantially all of the assets and certain of the liabilities of airvision  a manufacturer of in flight entertainment equipment 
on january   the company acquired all of the stock of burns  an industry leader in commercial aircraft seating 
on april   the company acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain of the liabilities of puritan bennett aero systems co  the leading manufacturer of commercial aircraft oxygen delivery systems  a leading manufacturer of passenger service unit components and systems  and a major supplier of air valves  overhead lights and switches  crew masks and protective breathing devices 
on april   the company acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain of the liabilities of aircraft modular products  the leading manufacturer of cabin interior products for general aviation business jet and commercial type vip aircraft 
while the company will continue to be susceptible to industry wide conditions  management believes that the company s significantly more diversified product line and revenue base achieved through acquisitions has reduced its exposure to demand fluctuations in any one product area 
the burns acquisition has had a significant impact on b e s results of operations 
burns  with calendar revenues of  was one of the three leading north american suppliers of commercial aircraft passenger seats and had a base of airline customers that was largely complementary to that of b e 
b e s and burns approximate share of the worldwide seating products market at the time of acquisition were approximately and  respectively  based on fiscal unit sales 
by consolidating engineering  marketing  administration and manufacturing operations of the two companies  b e has been able to reduce fixed costs  thereby enhancing its low cost position 
over the last two fiscal years  the company s gross margins have improved substantially  increasing from in fiscal to in fiscal and to in fiscal the primary reasons for the improvement in gross margins include i a company wide re engineering program  which has resulted in higher employee productivity and better manufacturing efficiency  ii higher unit volumes  and iii a shift in product mix in all groups toward higher margin products and services 
b e s business strategy is to maintain its market leadership position through various initiatives  including new product development 
in fiscal  research  development and engineering expenses totaled  or of net sales  primarily consisting of costs related to the development of the mdds and related boeing line fit expenditures  with the balance attributable to its seating and interior systems products businesses

liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity requirements consist of working capital needs  for ongoing capital expenditures and scheduled payments of interest on its indebtedness 
b e s primary requirements for working capital have been directly related to increased accounts receivable and inventory levels as a result of revenue growth 
b e s working capital was  as of february  including approximately  of cash from the net proceeds from the senior subordinated notes offering described below  as compared to  as of february  at february  the company s cash and cash equivalents were  as compared to  at february  cash provided from operating activities during fiscal was  and cash used in operating activities during fiscal was

in february  the company sold  of senior subordinated notes  the notes 
in conjunction with the sale of the notes  the company initiated a tender offer for the  of senior notes due the notes 
the net proceeds from the offering of approximately  were used i for the tender offer which expired on february  in which approximately  of the notes were retired  ii to call the remaining notes on march   and iii together with the proceeds from the bank credit facility  to fund the acquisitions of amp and pbasco 
the company incurred an extraordinary charge of  for unamortized debt issue costs  tender and redemption premiums and fees and expenses related to the repurchase of the notes 
long term debt at february  consists of the remaining notes not retired in the tender offer  the notes and senior subordinated notes due in april the company amended its credit facilities with the chase manhattan bank by increasing the aggregate principal amount that may be borrowed thereunder to  the bank credit facility 
the bank credit facility consists of a  revolving credit facility and an acquisition facility of up to  the acquisition facility is amortizable over five years beginning in april  the revolving credit facility expires in april the bank credit facility is collateralized by the company s accounts receivable and inventories and by substantially all of its other personal property 
the bank credit facility contains customary affirmative covenants  negative covenants and conditions of borrowing 
at february   indebtedness under the then existing bank credit facility consisted of letters of credit amounting to approximately  the company s capital expenditures were  and  during fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to i the development of a new management information system to replace the company s existing systems  many of which were inherited in acquisitions  and ii expenditures for plant modernization 
the management information system is expected to be installed over the next months and will be year compliant 
the company anticipates ongoing annual capital expenditures of approximately  for the next several years to be in line with the expanded growth in business and the recent acquisitions 
the company believes that the cash flow from operations  proceeds from the notes and availability under the bank credit facility will provide adequate funds for its working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and debt service requirements through the term of the bank credit facility 
the company believes that it will be able to refinance the bank credit facility prior to its termination  although there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so 
the company s ability to fund its operations  make planned capital expenditures  make scheduled payments and refinance its indebtedness depends on its future operating performance and cash flow  which  in turn  are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond its control 
year costs the company has recognized the need to ensure that its computer systems will not be adversely affected by the upcoming calendar year the company has assessed how it may be impacted by year and has formulated and commenced implementation of a comprehensive plan to address known issues as they relate to its information systems 
the plan  as it relates to information systems  involves a combination of software modification  upgrades and replacement 
the company estimates that the cost of year compliance for its information systems will not have a material adverse effect on the future consolidated results of operations of the company 
however  the company cannot measure the impact that the year issue will have on its vendors  suppliers  customers and other parties with which it conducts its business 
industry conditions the company s principal customers are the world s commercial airlines 
as a result  the company s business is directly dependent upon the conditions in the commercial airline industry 
in the late s and early s the world airline industry suffered a severe downturn which resulted in record losses and several air carriers seeking protection under bankruptcy laws 
as a consequence  during such period  airlines sought to conserve cash by reducing or deferring scheduled cabin interior refurbishment and upgrade programs and delaying purchases of new aircraft 
this led to a significant contraction in the commercial aircraft cabin interior products industry  and a decline in the company s business and profitability 
the airline industry has now experienced five consecutive years of profitability including record profitability in each of the last three calendar years 
this financial turnaround has  in part  been driven by record load factors  rising fare prices and declining fuel costs 
the airlines have substantially restored their balance sheets through cash generated from operations and debt and equity placements 
as a result  the levels of airline spending on refurbishment and new aircraft purchases have expanded 
however  due to the volatility of the airline industry there can be no assurance that the current profitability of the airline industry will continue or that the airlines will maintain or increase expenditures on cabin interior products for refurbishments or new aircraft 
in addition  the airline industry is undergoing a process of consolidation and significantly increased competition 
such consolidation could result in a reduction in future aircraft orders as overlapping routes are eliminated and airlines seek greater economics through higher aircraft utilization 
increased airline competition may also result in airlines seeking to reduce costs by producing greater price competition from airline cabin interior products manufacturers  thereby adversely affecting the company s margins
