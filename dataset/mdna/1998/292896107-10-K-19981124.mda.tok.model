land acquisition 
the company is continually exploring opportunities to purchase parcels of land for its homebuilding operations and is  at any given time  in various stages of proposing  making offers for  and negotiating the acquisition of various parcels  whether outright or through options 
the company has continued to increase its land development and construction activities in response to current and anticipated demand and expects to pursue additional land acquisition and development opportunities in the future

see note of notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
management does not anticipate that phmc s expansion of its operation will significantly impact liquidity because the mortgages are generally sold within a short period of time after their origination to the federal national mortgage association fnma or other qualified investors 
phmc has established the capability to retain the servicing of loans  however  during fiscal all servicing rights were sold 
inflation the company  as well as the homebuilding industry in general  may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation  primarily because of higher land and construction costs 
in addition  higher mortgage interest rates may significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective purchasers 
inflation also increases the company s interest costs and costs of labor and materials 
the company attempts to pass through to its customers any increases in its costs through increased selling prices and  to date  inflation has not had a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
however  there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on the company s future results of operation 
interest rates the company s operations are interest rate sensitive 
overall housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest costs 
if mortgage interest rates increase significantly  this may negatively impact the ability of a homebuyer to secure adequate financing 
such results of higher interest rates may result in adversely affecting the company s revenues  gross margins and net income 
year issues the company conducts its business primarily with commercial software provided by third party vendors 
after an analysis of the company s exposure to the impact of year issues  management believes that such commercial software is substantially year compliant and expects the cost of addressing remaining year issues to be less than  as part of its assessment  company management has been evaluating year compliance by those with whom it does business and to date has not discovered any year problems with significant counterparties that it believes are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect upon the company 
however  no assurances can be given that potential year problems at those with whom the company does business will not occur  and if these occur  consequences to the company will not be material
