if the company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations  it may be required to refinance all or a portion of its existing debt or obtain additional financing 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such refinancing or additional financing 
effects of inflation the markets in which the company sells products are competitive 
in particular  the company has encountered in connection with its sales of coated fabrics to the automotive industry and its sales of acrylics to the aerospace industry  effective resistance to price increases generally 
thus  in an inflationary environment the company might not in all instances be able to pass through to consumers general price increases  in which event the company s operations may be materially impacted if such conditions were to occur 
the company has not in the past been adversely impacted by general price inflation 
year many software applications and operational programs written in the past were not designed to recognize calendar dates beginning in the year the failure of such applications or systems to properly recognize the dates beginning in the year could result in miscalculations or system failures which could result in an adverse impact on the company s operations 
the company has instituted a year task force that reports to the audit committee of the board of directors 
the company has also initiated a comprehensive project  overseen by the task force  to prepare its computer systems  communication systems and manufacturing testing equipment for the year the project primarily includes three phases which are identification and assessment of all software  hardware and equipment that could potentially be affected by the year issue  remedial action necessary to bring such systems into compliance and further testing  if necessary 
the company has generally completed the identification and assessment phase of its project and is at various stages of remediation and testing the noted systems 
the company plans to complete this project by june  the company believes that the majority of its major systems are currently year compliant and costs to transition the remaining systems to year compliance are not anticipated to exceed approximately  the company has primarily used internal resources in its year project thus far and has incurred costs of less than  the company is also contacting critical suppliers of products and services and customers to determine the extent to which the company might be vulnerable to such parties failure to resolve their own year issues 
where practicable  the company will access and attempt to mitigate its risks with respect to the failure of these entities to be year ready 
the company does not have a concentration of dependence on these parties 
the effect  if any  on the company s results of operations from the failure of such parties to be year ready is not reasonably estimable 
currently the company does not expect to experience significant disruptions of its operations as a result of the change to the new millenium and therefore has not formulated a contingency plan for such occurrence 
forward looking information statements made herein that are forward looking in nature within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  those related to business conditions and the financial strength of the various markets served by the company  the level of spending for such products  the ability of the company to successfully manufacture and market its products and the ability of the company s suppliers and customers to adequately resolve their own year issues 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates 
the company s earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates on its floating rate long term debt and revolving credit advances 
the company s risk management policy includes the use of derivative financial instruments interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate exposure 
the counter parties are major financial institutions 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company s interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed and variable interest rate payments without exchanging the notional principal amount 
payments or receipts on the agreements are recorded as adjustments to interest expense 
at september   the company had outstanding swap agreements  maturing at various dates through  with an aggregate notional amount of million 
under these agreements the company receives a floating rate based on usd libor bba and pays a fixed weighted average interest rate of 
these swaps effectively change the company s payment of interest on million of its million variable rate debt at september  to fixed rate debt 
the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements represents the estimated receipts or payments that would be made to terminate the agreements 
at september   the company would have paid approximately million to terminate the agreements 
a decrease of basis points in the yield curve would increase the amounts paid by approximately million 
the fair value is based on dealer quotes  considering current interest rates 
at september   approximately million of the company s floating rate long term debt and revolving credit advances was not covered under an interest swap agreement 
for floating rate debt  interest changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flows assuming other factors are held constant 
based upon this balance  a change of one percent in the interest rate would cause a change in interest expense of approximately  on an annual basis
