item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s results of operations are primarily affected by its levels of net interest income  provisions for loan losses  non interest income  non interest expense and income taxes 
the company s results are strongly influenced by the southern california economy in which it operates 
net earnings of million or per share were recorded in  compared to net earnings of million or per share in and million or per share in all per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis 
the company s results over the last three years have continued to improve as southern california has recovered from the economic recession of the early s 
loan charge offs declined to million in compared to million in and million in in addition  transfers to valuation allowances for impaired loans declined to million in compared to million in and in certain key financial ratios for the company are presented below average return on return on equity to average average average assets equity assets core earnings reflect the company s results from basic operations and were million in  million in and million in core earnings are defined as net interest income before provision for loan losses plus other income excluding gain on sale of loans and securities less non interest expense 
non recurring items are excluded from core earnings 
core earnings increased in compared to and in compared to due to decreased levels of non performing assets and interest rates 
non performing assets primarily loans days past due or in foreclosure plus foreclosed real estate decreased to million or of total assets at december  compared to million or of total assets at december  and million or of total assets at december  the decreasing trend in non performing assets over the last two years is due to a lower balances of delinquent loans and foreclosed properties of all collateral types 
at december   the bank s regulatory risk based capital ratio was and the tangible and core capital ratios were 
the bank met the regulatory capital standards to be deemed well capitalized at december  the bank s deposits are insured by the saif up to a maximum of  for each insured depositor 
in the third quarter of  legislation was enacted by congress which included a one time assessment for saif members such as the bank 
accordingly  the bank recorded an accrual for the one time assessment  net of tax  of million during the third quarter of based on its level of insured deposits at march  
the one time assessment was paid during the fourth quarter of the bank s fdic insurance premiums decreased to million in compared to million in due to a drop in the assessment rate to basis points from basis points after the payment of the special assessment 
risks and uncertainties in the normal course of business  the company encounters two significant types of risk economic risk and regulatory risk 
economic risk there are two main components of economic risk credit risk and market risk which includes interest rate risk 
credit risk credit risk is the risk of default in the company s loan portfolio that results from a borrower s inability to make contractually required payments 
see loan loss provisions and non performing assets 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of real estate collateral is based on estimates that are susceptible to changes in the economic environment and market conditions 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses as of december  was adequate based on information available at that time 
a downward turn in the current economic climate could increase the likelihood of losses due to credit risks 
this could create the need for additional loan loss provisions 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss from unfavorable changes in market prices and interest rates 
the bank s market risk arises primarily from the interest rate risk inherent in its lending and deposit taking activities 
see asset liability management for additional information relating to market risk 
regulatory risk regulatory risk is the risk that the regulators will reach different conclusions than management regarding the financial position of the company 
the ots examines the bank s financial results annually 
the ots reviews the allowance for loan losses and may require the bank to adjust the allowance based on information available at the time of their examination 
other risks year issue the year issue arises because most computer hardware and software was developed without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century 
these computers have only a two digit field for the date which could change to the year after the in this case could denote the year causing computer applications to create erroneous results or to fail to make a calculation 
early in  the bank developed a process for addressing the year issue for the bank s major computer systems and applications 
an internal committee was formed to address the issue and a formal project plan was developed 
the bank s major computer applications are owned and operated by third party vendors 
therefore  the bank s challenge is to ensure that its vendors are compliant or have plans to become compliant before the year because the bank had plans to convert its major data processing systems to new systems during and  requirements for year compliance have been made a part of all new contracts 
contractual arrangements with the bank s major data processing vendors provide for representations and warranties regarding year compliance  regular monitoring of the vendors year project  substantial system compliance by the end of  and testing and verification in early other vendors using computer related date fields were surveyed to determine the level of compliance with year issues and their plans to rectify any problems 
all vendors were requested to reach compliance by the first quarter of this should allow sufficient time for the bank to test system compliance and determine the appropriate action based on the results 
the bank is developing contingency plans to cover the possibility that certain vendors may be unable to become compliant within the required time frame 
depending on a particular situation  the bank will develop a process by which it will determine whether to retain or discontinue the business relationship with the vendor 
this decision will be based on the impact of the particular non compliance on the bank s operations  the vendor s projected time frame for achieving compliance  and the cost to upgrade  replace or purchase the required software or hardware 
because of the third party nature of its major data processing relationships  the bank is not expected to bear any programming cost of making its systems year compliant 
the bank s major cost of year compliance is related to staff and management time spent planning  monitoring and testing the systems  which is not expected to be a significant cost 
therefore  year issues are expected to have an immaterial impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity and capital expenditures 
inflation inflation substantially impacts the financial position and operations of financial intermediaries  such as banks and savings institutions 
these entities primarily hold monetary assets and liabilities and  as such  can experience significant purchasing power gains and losses over relatively short periods of time 
in addition  interest rate changes during inflationary periods change the amounts and composition of assets and liabilities held by financial intermediaries and could result in regulatory pressure for additional equity investment 
pending lawsuits the bank has been named as a defendant in various lawsuits  none of which is expected to have a materially adverse effect on the company 
components of earnings net interest income net interest income is the primary component of the company s earnings 
the chief determinants of net interest income are the dollar amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid thereon 
the greater the excess of average interest earning assets over average interest bearing liabilities  the more beneficial the impact on net interest income 
the excess of average interest earning assets over average interest bearing liabilities was million in  million in and million in the increase over the last two years was due to improved net earnings and a continued improvement in asset quality 
the company s net interest income is also impacted by a three month time lag before changes in the cost of funds can be passed along to monthly adjustable rate loan customers 
savings and borrowing costs adjust to market rates immediately while it takes several months for the loan yield to adjust 
this time lag decreases the company s net interest income during periods of rising interest rates 
the reverse is true during periods of declining interest rates 
see asset liability management for further discussion 
the following table sets forth the components of interest earning assets and liabilities  the excess of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities  the yields earned and rates paid and net interest income for the periods indicated dollars in thousands average loans and mortgage backed securities    average investment securities    average interest earning assets    average savings deposits    average borrowings    average interest bearing liabilities    excess of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities    yields earned on average interest earning assets rates paid on average interest bearing liabilities net interest rate spread effective net spread total interest income    total interest expense    net interest income    non accrual loans were included in the average dollar amount of loans outstanding  but no income was recognized during the period that each such loan was on non accrual status 
dividends on fhlb stock and miscellaneous interest income and expense were not considered in this analysis 
excludes the effect of the irs accrued interest reversal 
the yield on earning assets increased slightly to in from in due to a decline in non performing assets 
this was offset by an basis point decrease in the cofi index which determines the yield on over of the bank s loan portfolio 
the bank s cost of funds increased by basis points in compared to due to the more extensive use of borrowings which cost more than deposits 
the increase in net interest spread from to was also due to improved asset quality  offset by the increased cost deposits and borrowings 
the table below sets forth certain information regarding changes in the interest income and interest expense of the bank for the periods indicated

loss provision the company recorded million in loan loss provisions during  less than the million recorded in and million in the southern california real estate markets continued to improve during the bank has a policy of providing for general valuation allowances  unallocated to any specific loan  but available to offset any future loan losses 
the allowance is maintained at an amount that management believes adequate to cover estimable and probable loan losses 
the general valuation allowance  excluding the general valuation allowance for loans sold with recourse  totaled million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the increase in general valuation allowances from to is a result of a decrease in loan charge offs 
in addition  the bank provided a million provision for losses on the impaired loan portfolio 
loan charge offs decreased from of average loans outstanding in to of average loans outstanding in the company also maintains valuation allowances for impaired loans and loans sold with recourse 
see allowances for loan losses 
management performs regular risk assessments of the bank s loan portfolio to maintain appropriate general valuation allowances 
additional loan loss provisions may also be required to the extent that charge offs are recorded against the valuation allowance for impaired loans or the general valuation allowance 
loan charge offs decreased to million in from million in and million in charge offs result from declines in the value of the underlying collateral of the non performing loans 
non interest income loan servicing and other fees were million in  million in and million in increased fees earned from loans brokered to other lenders were offset by decreased fees on loans serviced for other lenders during the increased fees in compared to were primarily the fees earned on loans brokered to other lenders 
gain loss on sale of loans increased to thousand in  compared with thousand in and a loss of million in the increased gains from to were the result of cash gains and fees recognized on sales of loans originated by the bank s new originaton unit  lend ffb 
the loss in resulted from a million provision for losses on loans that had been sold with recourse in prior years 
real estate operations resulted in a net gain of thousand compared to gains of million in and million in the amounts for and include million and thousand  respectively in provisions for losses on real estate 
gains from real estate operations generally result from the recovery of excess valuation allowances upon the sale of foreclosed properties 
the bank normally sells foreclosed properties within a few months after acquisition 
other operating income  which increased to million in from million in and million in consists primarily of fees earned for services provided in the retail savings branches 
fees earned by retail savings branches increased due to management s efforts to improve fee income  commissions on the sale of alternative investments and additional fees earned from off site atms 
non interest expense the ratio of non interest expense to average total assets for was  consistent with the ratio for after excluding the additional cost of the saif special assessment 
the ratio for was 
including the saif assessment  the ratio of non interest expense to average total assets was for salary and benefit costs increased in compared to due to incentive costs and retirement benefits 
incentive costs were higher due to the bank s increase in loan originations 
retirement benefits increased due to the promotion of an individual who will be included in the bank s serp and the establishment of a k plan for the bank s employees 
salary and benefit costs decreased in compared to due to decreased salary and benefit costs primarily due to attrition 
occupancy expense increased in compared to due primarily to the additional costs and depreciation expense associated with the bank s new loan origination system and call center 
occupancy expense was substantially unchanged in compared to other operating expenses increased during and consist primarily of costs associated with the upcoming data processing conversion and an increase in legal expenses 
other operating expenses decreased in compared to due primarily to lower insurance and data processing charges 
advertising expense increased by in compared to due to additional brand advertising and increased advertising for lend ffb 
advertising expense increased by in compared to due to the cost of new marketing initiatives related to retail deposit acquisition 
federal deposit insurance decreased in compared to due to a drop in the deposit insurance rate from to as a result of the economic growth act and a decline in total deposits

loan sales during were million in compared to million in increased loan originations during were largely offset by loan payoffs and sales during the year 
loan portfolio at the end of  of the bank s loan portfolio was adjustable based on monthly changes in the eleventh district federal home loan bank cost of funds index 
as part of its asset liability management strategy  the bank has maintained the level of adjustable loans in its portfolio at over for over ten years 
management believes that the high level of adjustable rate mortgages will help insulate the bank from fluctuations in interest rates  notwithstanding the several month lag between a change in its monthly cost of funds and a corresponding change in its loan yields 
see asset liability management 
the board of directors has authorized the origination of fixed rate loans  which feature initial fixed interest rates for  or years and thereafter become adjustable  up to an aggregate limit of million 
management believes that the limited origination of fixed rate loans will enhance the company s overall return on assets and improve loan originations in this economy 
in and  the bank through its lending division  firstfed mortgage services  placed million and million  respectively in mortgages with other lenders under fee arrangements  which amount is not included in loan originations 
in  loans made on the security of single family properties one to four units comprised of the dollar amount of new loan originations  loans made on the security of multi family properties comprised of new originations  and loans made on the security of commercial real estate properties comprised of new originations 
no construction loans and an insignificant amount of consumer loans were originated in adjustable rate mortgages comprised of new loan activity during compared to in the following table details loan originations by loan type for the periods indicated loan originations by type year ended december  dollars in thousands single family one to four units      multi family      commercial      other  total      loans originated upon the sale of the bank s real estate owned were million or of total originations in million of these loans were originated based on the security of single family properties  million were originated based on the security of multi family properties and thousand were based on the security of commercial properties 
from time to time  the bank converts loans into mortgage backed securities for use in securitized borrowings reverse repurchase agreements no loans were converted into mortgage backed securities during or million of loans were converted into mortgage backed securities in securitized loans have a lower risk weighting for regulatory risk based capital purposes 
in exchange for the enhanced credit risk associated with mortgage backed securities  the bank pays guarantee fees to fhlmc and or fnma 
the bank s adjustable rate loan products often provide for first year monthly payments that are lower than the fully indexed interest and principal due 
any interest not fully paid by such lower first year payments is added to the principal balance of the loan 
this causes negative amortization until payments increase to cover interest and principal shortfalls 
due to negative amortization  loan to value ratios may increase above those calculated at the inception of the loan 
to date  the bank s foreclosure experience on loans with negative amortization has been no different from that on the fully amortizing portfolio 
the amount of negative amortization recorded by the bank decreases in periods of declining interest rates and increases during periods of increasing interest rates 
the balance of negative amortization on all loans serviced by the bank was million at december  compared to million at december  and million at december the bank does not normally lend in excess of of the appraised collateral value on adjustable mortgage loans amls 
where the bank does lend in excess of of the appraised value  additional fees and rates are charged 
mortgage insurance is required on loans in excess of or premium rates and or fees are charged if the mortgage insurance requirement is waived 
subsequent to the origination of a loan  the bank may purchase private mortgage insurance with its own funds 
loans originated under this program for which there is no private mortgage insurance totaled million at december  compared to million at december  and million at december  see business interest rates  terms and fees 
loan composition loans based on the security of single family properties one to four units comprise the largest category of the bank s loan portfolio including mortgage backed securities 
the loan portfolio also includes loans secured by multi family and commercial properties 
at december   approximately of the loan and mortgage backed securities portfolio consisted of first liens on single family properties 
first liens on multi family properties comprised approximately of the portfolio  and first liens on commercial properties represented approximately of the portfolio 
multi family and commercial real estate loans are considered more susceptible to market risk than single family loans and higher interest rates and fees are charged to borrowers for these loans 
approximately of loan originations in were multi family loans compared to during both and multi family loans originated upon the sale of reo were approximately  and of total loan originations during  and  respectively 
the bank also has loss exposure on certain loans sold with recourse 
these loans are substantially all secured by multi family properties 
loans sold with recourse totaled million as of december   million as of december  and million as of december  although no longer owned by the bank  these loans are combined with the bank s loan portfolio for purposes of computing general valuation allowances and measuring risk exposure for regulatory capital purposes 
under the bank s current policy  it no longer enters into loans sold with recourse agreements

the decrease in non performing loans in compared to is due to reductions in delinquent loans and non performing loans of all asset types due to improvement in the southern california real estate markets 
the decrease in non performing loans in compared to was due primarily to a decrease in delinquent and non performing multi family loans 
single family non performing loans are primarily due to recession related factors such as layoffs  decreased incomes and decreased real estate values 
multi family and commercial non performing loans are attributable primarily to economic factors  declines in occupancy rates  and decreased real estate values 
the bank actively monitors the status of all non performing loans 
impaired loans totaled million  million and million  net of related allowances of million  million and million as of december   december  and  respectively 
see business risk elements for a further discussion of impaired loans 
the bank has debt restructurings which result from temporary modifications of principal and interest payments 
under these arrangements  loan terms are typically reduced to no less than a required monthly interest payment 
any loss of revenues under the modified terms would be immaterial to the bank 
if the borrower is unable to return to scheduled principal and interest payments at the end of the modification period  foreclosure procedures are initiated  or  in certain circumstances  the modification period is extended 
as of december   the bank had modified loans totaling million  net of loan loss allowances 
this compares with million and million net of allowances as of december  and december   respectively 
modified loans included in the impaired loan totals above totaled million  million and million  net  as of december   and  respectively 
no modified loans were days or more delinquent as of december  or december  modified loans days or more delinquent as of december  were thousand 
allowances for loan losses for an analysis of the changes in the loan loss allowances  see business risk elements 
at december   the general valuation allowance was million or of the bank s loans with loss exposure 
this compares to at the end of and at the end of in addition to the general valuation allowance and the allowance for impaired loans mentioned above  the bank also maintains an allowance for loans sold with recourse 
these allowances amounted to  and of loans sold with recourse at december   and  respectively 
management considers the current level of loss allowances adequate to cover the bank s loss exposure at this time 
however  there can be no assurance that future additions to loan loss allowances will not be required 
capital resources and liquidity liquidity requirements federal regulations currently require a savings institution to maintain a monthly average daily balance of liquid assets including cash  certain time deposits  bankers acceptances and specified united states government  state or federal agency obligations equal to at least of i the average daily balance of its net withdrawable accounts and short term borrowings during the preceding calendar quarter or ii the ending balance of its net withdrawable accounts as of the end of the preceding calendar quarter 
the liquidity requirement may be changed from time to time by the ots to any amount within the range of to of such accounts and borrowings depending upon economic conditions and the deposit flows of member institutions 
on november   the ots reduced this liquidity requirement to from 
the ots also gave institutions the option of using a quarterly average calculation or an end of quarter calculation of the liquidity base and removed the requirement of maintaining a monthly average balance of short term liquid assets equal to at least of the average daily balance of its net withdrawable accounts and short term borrowings 
monetary penalties may be imposed for failure to meet these liquidity ratio requirements 
the bank s liquidity ratio for the quarter ended december  was  which exceeded the applicable requirements 
external sources of funds external sources of funds include savings deposits  loan sales  advances from the fhlbsf and reverse repurchase agreements reverse repos 
for purposes of funding asset growth  the source or sources of funds with the lowest total cost for the desired term are generally selected 
the funding source used most often during was fhlb advances 
deposits obtained from national brokerage firms brokered deposits are considered a source of funds similar to a borrowing 
in evaluating brokered deposits as a source of funds  the cost of these deposits  including commission costs  is compared to other funding sources 
brokered deposits were million at december  this compares to million at december  and million at december  deposits at retail savings offices have remained steady at approximately billion for the last three years 
not considering interest credited of million  the bank experienced million in deposit outflows from savings offices during due to the availability of alternative investments paying higher returns to customers and intense competition for deposits by other financial institutions 
the bank also solicits deposits through telemarketing efforts 
telemarketing deposits are obtained by the bank s employees via telephone  from depositors outside of the bank s normal service areas 
telemarketing deposits decreased by to million at the end of this compares with million at the end of and million at the end of the level of telemarketing deposits varies based on the availability of higher yielding investments to investors  who are often professional money managers 
the availability of telemarketing deposits also varies based on the investors perception of the bank s creditworthiness 
reverse repurchase agreements are short term borrowings secured by mortgage backed securities 
these borrowings decreased to million at the end of from million at the end of and million at the end of borrowings under reverse repurchase agreements have decreased over the last three years due to paydowns of the underlying collateral 
the bank did not securitize any mortgage loans in or for this purpose 
fhlb advances increased to billion at the end of compared to billion at the end of and million at the end of fhlb advances increased during and because these were often the lowest cost source of funds available to the bank 
sales of loans were million in this compares to million during and million during the volume of loans sold varies with the amount of saleable loans originated 
internal sources of funds internal sources of funds include scheduled loan principal payments  loan payoffs  and positive cash flows from operations 
principal payments were million in compared to million in and million in principal payments include both amortization and prepayments and are a function of real estate activity and the general level of interest rates 
capital requirements current regulatory capital standards require that the bank maintain tangible capital of at least of total assets  core capital of of total assets  and risk based capital of of total assets  risk weighted 
among other things  failure to comply with these capital standards will result in restrictions on asset growth and necessitate the preparation of a capital plan  subject to regulatory approval 
generally  any institution with a risk based capital ratio in excess of and a core capital ratio greater than is considered well capitalized for regulatory purposes 
institutions who maintain this capital level can take in brokered deposits at their discretion  and if they achieve a sufficient ranking on their regulatory examination  may be assessed a lower deposit insurance rate 
management presently intends to maintain its capital position at levels above those required by regulators to ensure operating flexibility and growth capacity for the bank 
the bank s capital position is actively monitored by management 
the bank met the regulatory capital standards to be deemed well capitalized for purposes of the various regulatory measures of capital including the prompt corrective action regulations 
to be considered well capitalized for purposes of the prompt corrective action requirements the bank must maintain the capital ratios as set forth in the table below december  amount dollars in thousands core capital requirement  bank s core capital  excess core capital  tier risk based capital requirement  bank s tier risk based capital  excess tier risk based capital  risk based capital requirement  bank s risk based capital  excess risk based capital  asset liability management the bank s primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the bank s net interest income and capital  while  at the same time  adjusting the bank s asset liability mix to the achieve the most favorable impact on earnings 
the bank s asset liability management policy is designed to improve the balance between the maturities and repricings of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in order to better insulate net earnings from interest rate fluctuations 
under this program  the bank emphasizes the funding of monthly adjustable mortgages with short term savings and borrowings and matching the maturities of these assets and liabilities 
the majority of the bank s assets are monthly adjustable rate mortgages with interest rates that fluctuate based on changes in the fhlbsf eleventh district cost of funds index index 
these mortgages constitute over of the loan portfolio at the end of comparisons over the last several years show that changes in the bank s cost of funds generally correlates with changes in the index 
the bank does not use any futures  options or swaps in its asset liability strategy 
assets and liabilities which are subject to repricing are considered rate sensitive 
the mis match in the repricing of rate sensitive assets and liabilities is referred to as a company s gap 
the gap is positive if rate sensitive assets exceed rate sensitive liabilities 
generally  a positive gap benefits a company during periods of increasing interest rates 
the reverse is true during periods of decreasing interest rates 
however  because the index lags changes in market interest rates by three months while the bank s short term savings and borrowing costs adjust immediately  the bank s net interest income initially decreases during periods of rising interest rates and increases during periods of declining interest rates 
in order to minimize the impact of rate fluctuations on earnings  management s goal is to keep the one year gap at less than of total assets positive or negative 
at december  the company s one year gap was a positive million or of total assets 
this compares with positive gap ratios of and of total assets at december  and december   respectively

under this regulation  institutions are required to establish limits on the sensitivity of their net interest income and net portfolio value to changes in interest rates 
such changes in interest rates are defined as instantaneous and sustained movements in interest rates in basis point increments
