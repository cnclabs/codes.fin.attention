the increase in operating supplies and expenses was primarily due to higher trailing equipment lease and rental costs 
the decline in insurance and claims expense was a result of lower collision frequency  primarily related to a decision to limit the speed of the tractor fleet to miles per hour and the more experienced driver force attracted by the new compensation package

fuel and fuel taxes increased due to significantly higher fuel costs per gallon 
this increased cost was partly offset by fuel surcharge revenue which was billed to customers
