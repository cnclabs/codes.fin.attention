the million increase during as compared to was attributable to an increase in base rentals from non related parties due to the various acquisitions made by the trust during the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of see note 
the average occupancy rate of a hospital is affected by a number of factors  including the number of physicians using the hospital  changes in the number of beds  the composition and size of the population of the community in which the hospital is located  general and local economic conditions  variations in local medical and surgical practices and the degree of outpatient use of the hospital services 
current industry trends in utilization and occupancy have been significantly affected by changes in reimbursement policies of third party payors 
a continuation of such industry trends could have a material adverse impact upon the future operating performance of the trust s facilities 
the trust s facilities have experienced growth in outpatient utilization over the past several years 
the increase is primarily the result of advances in medical technologies and pharmaceutical improvements  which allow more services to be provided on an outpatient basis  and increased pressure from medicare  medicaid  health maintenance organizations hmos  preferred provider organizations ppos and insurers to reduce hospital stays and provide services  where possible  on a less expensive outpatient basis 
the hospital industry in the united states  as well as the trust s acute care facilities  continue to have significant unused capacity which has created substantial competition for patients 
inpatient utilization continues to be negatively affected by payor required  pre admission authorization and payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients 
the trust expects its facilities to continue to experience increased competition  admission constraints and payor pressures 
an increased proportion of the revenues generated at the trust s hospital facilities are derived from fixed payment services  including medicare and medicaid 
the medicare program reimburses the trust s hospital facilities primarily based on established rates by a diagnosis related group for acute care hospitals and by cost based formula for behavioral health facilities 
historically  rates paid under medicare s prospective payment system pps for inpatient services have increased  however  these increases have been less than cost increases 
pursuant to the terms of the balanced budget act of the act  there will be no increases in the rates paid to hospitals for inpatient care through september  reimbursement for bad debt expense and capital costs  as well as other items  have been reduced 
payments for medicare outpatient services provided at general hospitals and all services provided at rehabilitation hospitals historically have been reimbursed on costs  subject to certain limits 
the act requires that the reimbursement for these services be converted to a pps  which will be phased in over time 
while the trust is unable to predict what  if any  future health reform legislation may be enacted at the federal or state level  the trust expects its facilities to continue to experience pressure to limit expenditures by governmental healthcare programs 
further changes in the medicare or medicaid programs and other proposals to limit healthcare spending could have a material adverse impact on the operating results of the trust s facilities and the healthcare industry 
in general  the operators of the trust s facilities expect to continue to experience an increase in business from managed care programs  including hmos and ppos 
the consequent growth in managed care networks and the resulting impact of these networks on the operating results of the trust s facilities vary among the markets in which the trust s facilities operate 
management of the trust is unable to predict the rate of growth of the net revenues of its facilities and the resulting impact on bonus revenues  which are computed as a percentage of each facility s net revenues in excess of base year amounts or cpi increases in excess of base year amounts 
net revenues of the trust s facilities are dependent upon developments in medical technologies and physician practice patterns  both of which are beyond the control of management of the facilities 
interest expense increased  or in as compared to due primarily to the additional borrowings used to finance the and acquisitions and additions see note 
interest expense increased  or in as compared to due primarily to the additional borrowings used to finance the purchase of equity interests in various limited liability companies and limited partnerships during the first and second quarters of  the purchase of four preschool and child care centers during the second quarter of  and the medical office buildings acquired by the trust during the third and fourth quarters of see note 
depreciation and amortization expense increased  or in as compared to due primarily to the depreciation expense related to the and acquisitions described in note depreciation and amortization expense increased  or in as compared to due to the depreciation expense related to the and acquisitions see note 
other operating expenses increased  or in as compared to due primarily to the expenses related to the medical office buildings acquired by the trust during the second quarter of and the third quarter of and a  increase in various other operating expenses 
other operating expenses increased  or in as compared to due primarily to the expenses related to the medical office buildings acquired by the trust during the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of and a  increase in the reserve established for future expenses related to the settlement of lakeshore hospital 
the expenses related to the medical office buildings totaled  in   in and  in the majority of these expenses are passed on directly to the tenants and are included as revenues in the trust s statements of income 
net income for was million or per basic and diluted share compared to million or per basic and diluted share in and million or per basic and diluted share in funds from operations ffo  which is the sum of net income plus depreciation expense for consolidated investments and unconsolidated investments and amortization of interest rate cap expense  totaled million in  million in and million in ffo does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the trust s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
general the matters discussed in this report  as well as the news releases issued from time to time by the trust  include certain statements containing the words believes  anticipates  intends  expects  and words of similar import  which constitute forward looking statements  within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results  performance achievements of the trust or industry results to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such factors include  among other things  the fact that a substantial portion of the trust s revenues are dependent on one operator  universal health services  inc  uhs and that a substantial portion of the trust s leases are involved in the healthcare industry which is undergoing substantial changes and is subject to pressure from government reimbursement programs and other third party payors 
in recent years  an increasing number of legislative initiatives have been introduced or proposed in congress and in state legislatures that would effect major changes in the healthcare system  either nationally or at the state level 
in addition  the healthcare industry has been characterized in recent years by increased competition and consolidation 
management of the trust is unable to predict the effect  if any  these industry factors will have on the operating results of its lessees  including the facilities leased to subsidiaries of uhs  or on their ability to meet their obligations under the terms of their leases with the trust 
the trust disclaims any obligation to update any such factors or to publicly announce the result of any revisions to any of the forward looking statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments 
management of the trust cannot predict whether the leases with subsidiaries of uhs  which have renewal options at existing lease rates  or any of the trust s other leases  will be renewed at the end of their initial lease terms 
representatives of uhs and the trustees who are unaffiliated with uhs have commenced informal discussions regarding the terms under which uhs would be willing to extend the leases on those facilities with terms expiring in through  some of which have had ebitdar of less than times the rent payable to the trust see note 
there is no assurance that an agreement will be reached or  if an agreement is reached  what terms will be agreed upon 
if the leases are not renewed at their current rates  the trust would be required to find other operators for those facilities and or enter into leases on terms potentially less favorable to the trust than the current leases 
management of the trust recognizes the need to evaluate the impact on its operations of the change to calendar year and does not expect the total cost of required building related modifications to have a material impact on its results of operations 
however  management of the trust cannot estimate the magnitude of calendar year related issues on the operations of its tenants and no estimates can be given on the potential adverse impact on the trust s results of operations resulting from failure of its tenants to adequately prepare for the year
