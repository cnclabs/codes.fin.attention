 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits 
the assumed discount rate used to compute the actuarial present value of benefit obligations was lowered to percent at december  due to decreased rates of high quality  long term investments  thereby increasing the benefit obligations and unrecognized net loss of the plans 
the deferral of the increase in the actual return on plan assets during over the assumed return of percent  which occurred due primarily to favorable returns on equity investments  caused an offsetting decrease to the cumulative unrecognized net loss of the plans

the current portion of the accrued postretirement liability  amounting to million at december   is included in other accruals 
the assumed discount rate used to calculate the actuarial present value of the postretirement benefit obligations was lowered to percent at december  due to decreased rates of high quality  long term investments  thereby increasing the cumulative unrecognized net loss for the postretirement plans
