item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the company was founded in and operated only in the phoenix  arizona area until in it expanded to tucson  arizona  in to southern california  in to texas and in to nevada 
from inception through  the company exclusively engaged in the refabrication of ocean going cargo containers  which it leased to the public for storage containers and portable offices 
in  the company began to sell containers 
contributing to growth of sales revenues was the development of a national distribution system referred to by the company as the national dealer network  manufacture of new company designed containers from raw steel as an alternative and supplement to the refabrication of ocean going containers  the manufacture of modular steel buildings discontinued in  see item description of business business restructuring and special order products which the company leases and sells to schools  governmental entities and others  and the development of the telecommunication shelter division which commenced operations in mid year the leasing of containers has become the more significant portion of the company s business and is contributing to the company s growth 
since  the number of units at the company s leasing locations has increased by the following percentages as compared to the preceding year december  as the leasing operations are the most profitable of the company s operations  management plans to increase the level of these operations  especially at existing locations 
in addition  the company expects to open additional facilities through acquisitions or the start up of new locations on a controlled basis at locations which management believes can become profitable over a relatively short period of time 
the company manufactures and or refurbishes containers for use in its lease fleet 
containers are transferred to the lease fleet at cost  without recognizing any manufacturing profit on the value added to the refurbished containers or new containers 
in addition  the company s container lease fleet has been acquired over the last years 
during parts of this period  raw container prices were significantly lower than they are today 
an appraisal of the fair market value of the container lease fleet performed in resulted in a total fair market value of approximately  this exceeds the carrying value of the containers by approximately  at december  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals  this differential is not recognized in the company s financial statements 
uncertainties faced by the company include variances in start up costs for new storage locations  the availability of acquisitions on terms acceptable to the company  competition in new markets  and the opportunity cost of deploying sufficient containers in a new market to reach economic viability 
while the company has experience in entering new market areas and conducts preliminary market research to assure itself that viable markets exist  there can be no assurance of success when expanding into new markets 
however  unlike fixed mini storage facilities  the company does have the ability to relocate its portable storage containers to other markets to adjust for market demand

sales of the company s products decreased by  primarily due to the discontinuation of the modular building operations 
this decline in sales was offset  to some extent  by an approximate  increase in the sale of telecommunication shelters 
during the company implemented price increases on the sale of containers through its branches and through the national dealer program

seasonality demand for off site container leases is stronger from september through december due to increased needs for storing inventory for the holiday season by the company s retail customers 
containers used by these customers are often returned early in the following year  usually causing a lower than normal occupancy rate for the company during the first quarter 
the occupancy levels have historically ranged from a low of to a high of 
these seasonable fluctuations created a marginal decrease in cash flow for each of the first quarters during the past several years 
liquidity and capital resources the company required increased amounts of financing to support the growth of its business during the last several years 
this financing has been required primarily to fund the acquisition and manufacture of containers for the company s lease fleet  the acquisition of property  plant and equipment and the expansion of the company s manufacturing facilities 
in february  the company received proceeds of million in connection with the exercise of warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at per share 
these warrants had been issued in connection with the company s initial public offering in in october  the company issued million of senior subordinated notes notes with redeemable warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at per share 
the notes are due november  from the net proceeds of the sale of the notes  the company repaid million in bridge notes issued in july and reduced the borrowings outstanding under the revolving line of credit under the senior credit agreement with the remainder of the net proceeds 
because the notes were offered as part of a unit with redeemable warrants  a portion of the original offering price for a unit was allocated to the notes and a portion to the redeemable warrants based on their respective fair market values 
the resulting discount increases the effective interest rate of the notes and is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the notes 
the indenture related to the notes requires the company to comply with certain covenants including maintaining a specific tangible net worth  a maximum total funded indebtedness ratio and a maximum senior funded indebtedness ratio 
the company has been in compliance with the financial covenants at all determination dates 
in order to improve its cash flow  increase its borrowing availability and fund its continued growth  in march the company entered into the senior credit agreement with bt commercial corporation  as agent for a group of lenders the lenders 
under the terms of the senior credit agreement  the lenders provided the company with a million revolving line of credit  amended in to million  and a million term loan 
borrowings under the senior credit agreement are secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
borrowings under the term loan are to be repaid over a five year period 
interest accrues on the term loan at the company s option at either prime plus or the eurodollar rate plus 
borrowings under the term loan are payable monthly as follows plus interest months through april march 


 months through april march 


 months through april march 


 additional principal payments equal to of excess cash flow  as defined in the term loan documents which constitute part of the senior credit agreement  are required annually 
as of december   no additional payment was required under this provision 
available borrowings under the revolving line of credit are based upon the level of the company s inventories  receivables and container lease fleet 
the container lease fleet will be appraised at least annually  and up to of the lesser of cost or appraised orderly liquidation value may be included in the borrowing base 
interest accrues at the company s option at either prime plus or the eurodollar rate plus and is payable monthly or at the end of the term of any eurodollar borrowing period 
the term of this revolving line of credit is three years  with a one year extension option 
as of december   million of borrowings were outstanding and approximately million of additional borrowing was available under the revolving line of credit 
at march   million of borrowings were outstanding and approximately million of additional borrowing was available 
the senior credit agreement contains several financial covenants including a minimum tangible net worth requirement  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  a maximum ratio of debt to equity  minimum operating income levels and minimum required utilization rates 
in addition  the senior credit agreement contains limits on capital expenditures  acquisitions  changes in control  the incurrence of additional debt  and the repurchase of common stock  and prohibits the payment of dividends 
the company has been in compliance with such financial covenants at all determination dates 
during  the company s operations provided cash flow of  compared to utilizing  in the improvement in cash flow resulted primarily from improved operating results achieved in cash flow in was adversely affected by a reduction of accounts payables partially offset by an increase in leasing receivables which typically have a longer turnover period 
during  the company invested  in equipment and the container lease fleet 
this amount is net of  in container sales and equipment financing 
cash flow from financing activities totaled  during this was the result of increased borrowings  under the revolving line of credit  to finance container lease fleet and equipment acquisitions  and the issuance of the notes  partially offset by the principal payments on indebtedness and additional financing costs incurred 
the company believes that its current capitalization  together with borrowings available under the senior credit agreement  is sufficient to maintain its current level of operations and permit a modest level of growth 
however  should demand for the company s products continue to grow at a significant rate  the company would be required to secure additional financing through additional borrowings  debt or equity offerings  or a combination of these sources to meet this demand 
the company believes that such financing will be available  however  there is no assurance that any such financings will be obtained or obtained on terms acceptable to the company
