 which reports contain more detailed information concerning timet  including complete financial statements 
general 
the aerospace industry in recent history has accounted for approximately two thirds of us and to of worldwide titanium mill products consumption  and has had a significant effect on the overall sales and profitability of the titanium industry 
the aerospace industry  and consequently the titanium metals industry  is highly cyclical 
timet and the industry were significantly and adversely affected during the early s by excess worldwide production capacity  depressed levels of spending for both military and commercial aircraft  and depressed selling prices resulting from  among other things  weak demand and relatively inexpensive titanium scrap  sponge and other mill products  principally from the fsu 
timet estimates that worldwide industry shipments of titanium mill products were relatively flat in the period between and  increased in  in and further increased in  to approximately  metric tons 
timet also estimates that industry mill product shipments to the commercial aerospace market in approximated  metric tons  a increase over levels following a increase in timet s order backlog increased to approximately million at december   from million at december  beginning in the second half of and continuing through  timet experienced a significant increase in requests for quotations  increased orders and increased prices on accepted orders resulting in an increase in average mill product prices of in following a increase in prices for have generally flattened  in part due to the price stabilizing influence of the boeing agreement 
growth in timet s earnings over the next few years is expected to be primarily dependent upon volume increases and productivity improvements rather than higher prices 
timet expects to operate its plants at or near practical capacity in due to the volume increases that timet expects as a result of the boeing agreement  expected continued growth in industrial markets and emerging uses of titanium  timet is adding additional melting and forging capacity during that should be more cost effective than certain present capacity and would replace existing equipment in the event of a downturn 
while aircraft production rates and backlogs appear to indicate a longer  flatter aerospace cycle than previous cycles  timet believes that customers have built inventories based on expected further increases in aircraft production rates that were later modified 
as a result  timet believes there is some excess titanium in the aerospace production system that could result in push out of some shipments to customers and some order cancellations as customers adjust their inventories in the short term 
certain current initiatives to invest in timet s future are expected to result in higher expenses in  with benefits not fully realized until or beyond 
spending in for research and development  other corporate development activities related to development of new markets and expenses related to timet s enterprise wide business process information systems sap project and related upgrade of information technology infrastructure are expected to be higher than in as a result of certain systems being designed to use two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  certain of timet s information and manufacturing systems have date sensitive software and hardware that may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year the year issue 
this could result in system failures or miscalculations resulting in disruptions of manufacturing or other normal business activities 
many of timet s information systems are being replaced in connection with the implementation of sap which is expected to be completed in sap is year compliant 
timet is in process of expediting its remaining portfolios of non compliant software and hardware and expects to complete this process in timet preliminarily estimates that the costs  excluding the implementation of sap  to address the year issue could be over million  which is expected to be incurred primarily from mid through mid years ended december  in millions net sales operating income general corporate income  net interest expense pretax income loss income taxes 
minority interest convertible preferred securities 
other minority interest net income loss tremont s equity in timet s income loss sales and operating income 
all mill products price and volume comparisons in this discussion are pro forma assuming the imi titanium acquisition and the ajm acquisition  both completed during  had occurred at the beginning of the pro forma effect of other acquisitions on price and volume information is not material 
the significant improvements in sales  operating income and operating margins in over and in over were driven by price and volume increases for titanium products in both commercial aerospace and other markets 
sales volume of titanium mill products increased in  to approximately  metric tons  following a increase in average selling prices in were approximately over  which were up approximately over the selling price increases reflect both the pass through of cost increases  particularly raw material costs  and real price improvement associated with increased market demand 
operating levels at timet s plants in both and were generally higher than in the respective prior year and contributed to the improved operating results 
the vdp titanium sponge plant operated at approximately of its annual practical capacity in both and and in timet restarted production of titanium sponge at its original kroll leach facility during the second quarter of in response to demand for certain grades of titanium sponge  and further increased production levels in in  timet s worldwide mill product capacity utilization approximated  up from in and in timet has substantial operations and assets located in europe  principally the united kingdom 
the us dollar value of timet s foreign sales and operating costs are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may slightly impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period to period operating results 
approximately one half of timet s european sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally major european currencies 
certain purchases of raw materials  principally titanium sponge  for timet s european operations are denominated in us dollars  while labor and other production costs are primarily denominated in local currencies 
interest expense 
interest expense declined in both and principally due to relative average borrowing levels 
minority interest 
annual dividend expense related to the convertible preferred securities  issued in november  approximates million  including amortization of financing costs  and is reported as minority interest net of allocable income taxes 
other minority interest relates primarily to the interest in timet savoie held by cezus 
income taxes 
timet s income tax rate in and varied from the us statutory rate principally due to reductions in the deferred tax valuation allowance related to current year utilization of tax attributes and  in  a million reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance resulting from a change in estimate of the net operating loss carryforwards and alternative minimum tax carryforwards that would more likely than not be realized in the future 
timet s effective income tax rate in varied from the us statutory rate due primarily to losses for which recognition of a deferred tax asset was not considered appropriate at the time 
timet operates in several tax jurisdictions and is subject to varying income tax rates 
for financial reporting purposes  timet has recognized substantially all of its carryforwards and  accordingly  expects that its effective income tax rate beginning in will increase and more closely approximate the us federal statutory rate 
nl industries  inc 
the company s interest in nl is reported by the equity method 
tremont reports its interest in nl by the equity method due to the fact that tremont and nl may be deemed to be under common control by reason of stock ownership and common directors and executive officers 
valhi  inc and tremont together may be deemed to control nl 
the information included below relating to the financial position  results of operations and liquidity and capital resources of nl has been summarized from reports filed with the commission by nl file no 
 which reports contain more detailed information concerning nl  including complete financial statements on nl s historical basis of accounting 
tremont s equity in earnings of nl differs from the amount that would be expected by applying tremont s ownership percentage to nl s separately reported earnings because of the effect of amortization of purchase accounting adjustments made by tremont in conjunction with the acquisitions of its interest in nl 
amortization of such basis differences generally reduces earnings  and increases losses  attributable to nl as reported by tremont 
nl s continuing operations are conducted by kronos in the tio business segment 
as discussed below  average tio selling prices declined in and compared to the prior year  but average selling prices increased during each of the last three quarters of compared to the immediately preceding quarter

kronos operating income includes million of income resulting from german trade capital tax refunds related to prior years  including interest 
the german tax authorities were required to remit refunds based on i recent court decisions which resulted in reducing the trade capital tax base and ii prior agreements between nl and the german tax authorities regarding payment of disputed taxes 
kronos cost of sales in was lower than due to the favorable effects of foreign currency translation and lower unit costs  primarily due to higher production levels  partially offset by higher sales volumes 
kronos cost of sales in was higher than due to higher sales volumes and higher unit costs  primarily due to lower production levels 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of sales decreased in primarily due to lower unit costs and increased in primarily due to the impact on net sales of decreased average selling prices 
kronos selling  general and administrative expenses declined in from the previous year due to favorable effects of foreign currency translation and german trade capital tax refunds  partially offset by higher distribution expenses associated with higher sales volumes  while expenses were lower than as a result of continuing cost containment efforts 
record sales volume of  metric tons of tio in was higher than  with improvements in all major markets  including a increase in europe 
approximately one half of kronos tio sales  by volume  were attributable to markets in europe with approximately attributable to north america  approximately to asia and the balance to other regions 
strong demand growth during and the first half of allowed kronos to maintain full capacity production rates in kronos believes that the increased demand was partially due to customers stocking inventories 
in the second half of and first half of  customers reduced inventory levels  which reduced industry wide demand and kronos responded by reducing production rates 
kronos average capacity utilization was approximately in demand improved in the second half of and throughout kronos produced at near full capacity in pricing of tio has historically been cyclical 
kronos anticipates its tio operating income and margins will continue to improve in compared to as the impact of announced tio price increases take effect 
demand for tio in increased over and kronos expects demand will increase in  although kronos sales volume is expected to be slightly lower as a result of kronos lower inventory levels at the beginning of the year 
kronos believes continued growth in demand should result in significant improvement in average selling prices over the longer term 
nl has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states principally germany  norway  belgium and canada 
the us dollar translated value of nl s foreign sales and operating costs is subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may slightly impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period to period revenues and expenses 
a significant amount of nl s sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in  principally major european currencies and the canadian dollar 
certain purchases of raw materials  primarily titanium containing feedstocks  are denominated in us dollars  while labor and other production costs are primarily denominated in local currencies 
fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies decreased sales by million and million during and  respectively  compared to the year earlier period 
fluctuation in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies similarly impacted nl s operating expenses and the net impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on operating income comparisons was not significant in or securities earnings fluctuate in part based upon the amount of funds invested and yields thereon 
corporate expenses  net in exceeded that of  primarily due to the million noncash charge related to nl s adoption of sop corporate expenses  net in were lower than due to lower provisions for environmental remediation cost 
in nl expects corporate expenses  net will be lower than due to the absence of the million noncash charge 
interest expense declined in from due to lower levels of kronos deutsche mark denominated debt  partially offset by higher variable interest rates on such debt 
interest expense in declined compared to principally due to lower interest rates on variable rate debt  principally kronos dm denominated debt  partially offset by higher levels of such debt 
interest expense in is expected to be lower compared to due to lower expected levels of outstanding indebtedness  including required payments on the dm term loan and anticipated prepayments of the joint venture term loan 
nl s operations are conducted on a worldwide basis and the geographic mix of income can significantly impact nl s effective income tax rate 
in and  the geographic mix of income  including losses in certain jurisdictions for which no current refund was available and recognition of a deferred tax asset was not considered appropriate  contributed to nl s effective tax rate varying from a normally expected rate 
due to nl s higher us earnings before taxes in  nl changed its estimate of the future tax benefit of certain us tax credits which nl believes satisfies the more likely than not recognition criteria 
accordingly  nl s valuation allowance was reduced by approximately million 
during nl also recorded deferred tax benefits of million due to the reduction in dividend withholding tax rates pursuant to ratification of the us canada income tax treaty

tremont s corporate expenses  net for include a million special compensation accrual to an executive officer of the company as approved by the company s board of directors 
certain amounts of this award have been deferred under an agreement between the company and the executive officer 
in connection with timet s stock offering in june  the company sold million shares of timet common stock with net proceeds of approximately million  resulting in a pre tax gain of million 
income taxes 
the company s income tax rate in varied from the us statutory rate principally due to no tax benefit being recognizable on equity in losses from its investment in nl 
the variance in rates in was principally due to a reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance to reflect the current utilization of its us nols and in to a reduction in the valuation allowance related to no income tax provision being required on equity in earnings of nl

nl is currently unable to pay dividends due to restrictions under certain of its debt agreements 
timet did not pay any cash dividends during  or timet s bank credit agreement generally limits dividend payments to approximately of net income and timet s convertible preferred securities may also  under certain circumstances  limit timet s ability to pay dividends 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in february  tremont s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of tremont common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
such shares represented approximately of the company s million shares then outstanding 
during the company repurchased  common shares of its stock for approximately million average per share pursuant to this repurchase program 
the repurchased shares will be added to the company s treasury and could be used for future acquisitions or other corporate purposes 
the company s million increase in cash and cash equivalents during was primarily the result of the company s sale of timet common stock and timet s repayment of loans to the company from proceeds of timet s stock offering

as previously reported  based upon the technical provisions of the investment company act of the act and tremont s ceasing to own a majority of timet s common stock following the imi titanium acquisition by timet in february  tremont might arguably be deemed to have become an investment company under the act  despite the fact that tremont does not now engage  nor has it engaged or intended to engage in the business of investing  reinvesting  owning  holding or trading of securities 
tremont has taken the steps necessary to give itself the benefits of a temporary exemption under the act and has sought an order from the commission that tremont is primarily engaged  through timet and nl  in a non investment company business 
the company believes another exemption may be currently available to it under the act should the commission deny tremont s application for an exemptive order

nl s estimated and capital expenditures are million for each year and include million for each year in the area of environmental protection and compliance primarily related to the off gas desulfurization systems 
in the last three years nl spent million million in in capital expenditures related to its substantially completed debottlenecking project at its leverkusen  germany chloride process tio facility 
the debottlenecking project increased nl s annual attainable production by approximately  metric tons  and nl estimates its worldwide annual attainable capacity is  metric tons

based upon nl s expectations for the tio industry and anticipated demands on nl s cash resources as discussed herein  nl expects to have sufficient liquidity to meet its near term obligations including operations  capital expenditures and debt service 
to the extent that actual developments differ from nl s expectations  nl s liquidity could be adversely affected 
certain of nl s tax returns in various us and us jurisdictions are being examined and tax authorities have proposed or may propose tax deficiencies 
nl previously reached an agreement with the german tax authorities and paid certain tax deficiencies of approximately dm million million when paid  including interest  which resolved significant tax contingencies for years through during nl reached a tentative agreement with the german tax authorities regarding the years through  and expects to pay dm million million at december  during in settlement of certain tax issues 
certain other significant german tax contingencies remain outstanding for the years through and will continue to be litigated 
with respect to these contingencies  nl has received certain revised tax assessments aggregating dm million million at december   including non income tax related items and interest  for years through nl expects to receive tax assessments for an additional dm million million at december   including non income tax related items and interest  for the years through no payments of tax or interest deficiencies related to these assessments are expected until the litigation is resolved 
during a german tax court proceeding involving a tax issue substantially the same as that involved in nl s primary remaining tax contingency was decided in favor of the taxpayer 
the german tax authorities have appealed that decision to the german supreme court  nl believes that the decision by the german supreme court will be rendered within two years and will become a legal precedent which will likely determine the outcome of nl s primary dispute with the german tax authorities which assessments  including non income tax related items and interest  aggregate dm million 
although nl believes that it will ultimately prevail  nl has granted a dm million million at december  lien on its nordenham  germany tio plant in favor of the city of leverkusen  and a dm million million at december  lien in favor of the german federal tax authorities 
during nl received a tax assessment from the norwegian tax authorities proposing tax deficiencies of nok million million at december  relating to nl has appealed this assessment and expects to litigate this issue 
no assurance can be given that these tax matters will be resolved in nl s favor in view of the inherent uncertainties involved in court proceedings 
nl believes that it has adequately provided accruals for additional taxes and related interest expense which may ultimately result from all such examinations and believes that the ultimate disposition of such examinations should not have a material adverse effect on nl s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
at december  nl had net deferred tax liabilities of million 
nl operates in numerous tax jurisdictions  in certain of which it has temporary differences that net to deferred tax assets before valuation allowance 
nl has provided a deferred tax valuation allowance of million at december   principally related to the us and germany  partially offsetting deferred tax assets which nl believes do not currently meet the more likely than not recognition criteria 
in addition to the chemicals business conducted through kronos  nl also has certain interests and associated liabilities relating to certain discontinued or divested businesses  and holdings of marketable equity securities including securities issued by valhi and other contran subsidiaries 
nl has been named as a defendant  prp  or both  in a number of legal proceedings associated with environmental matters  including waste disposal sites  mining locations and facilities currently or previously owned  operated or used by nl  certain of which are on the us epa s superfund national priorities list or similar state lists 
on a quarterly basis  nl evaluates the potential range of its liability at sites where it has been named as a prp or defendant 
nl believes it has adequate accruals for reasonably estimable costs of such matters  but nl s ultimate liability may be affected by a number of factors  including changes in remedial alternatives and costs and the allocation of such costs among prps 
nl is also a defendant in a number of legal proceedings seeking damages for personal injury and property damage arising out of the sale of lead pigments and lead based paints 
there is no assurance that nl will not incur future liability in respect of this pending litigation in view of the inherent uncertainties involved in court and jury rulings in pending and possible future cases 
however  based on  among other things  the results of such litigation to date  nl believes that the pending lead pigment and paint litigation is without merit 
nl has not accrued any amounts for such pending litigation 
liability that may result  if any  cannot reasonably be estimated 
nl currently believes the disposition of all claims and disputes  individually or in the aggregate  should not have a material adverse effect on nl s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
there can be no assurance that additional matters of these types will not arise in the future 
as discussed above  nl has substantial operations located outside the united states for which the functional currency is not the us dollar 
as a result  the reported amount of nl s assets and liabilities related to its non us operations  and therefore nl s consolidated net assets  will fluctuate based upon changes in currency exchange rates 
the carrying value of nl s net investment in its german operations is a net liability due principally to its dm credit facility  while its net investment in its other non us operations are net assets 
as a result of certain computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  certain of nl s computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year the year issue 
this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in normal business activities 
nl has completed the process of evaluating the modifications to critical software required to mitigate the year issue 
nl is in the process of communicating with its significant customers and suppliers to determine the extent to which nl is vulnerable to those third parties failure to minimize their own year issue 
nl is utilizing both internal and external resources to reprogram or replace and test its software and expects to complete substantially all of the requirements by the first quarter of however  if such modifications are not made or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material adverse impact on the operations of nl 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which nl s systems rely will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with nl s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on nl 
nl s estimate of the costs to complete the modifications to critical software required to address the year issue is not significant
