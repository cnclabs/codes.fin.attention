introduction the company s primary financial goals are to increase sales and earnings per share an average of per year  to achieve an annual return on beginning equity roe of or above  to increase dividends per share in line with earnings growth  and to maintain a prudent ratio of total debt to total capitalization  net of cash leverage 
the company has achieved these goals over the last ten years  increasing sales and earnings per share at compound annual rates of and  respectively  averaging roe  increasing dividends per share at a compound annual rate of and averaging leverage 
the company believes that the principal factors affecting its ability to achieve these objectives in the future are likely to be the realized rates of both acquisition and internal growth and the company s continued ability to integrate acquired businesses through a process called newellization 
since  the company has nearly tripled its sales by acquiring businesses with aggregate annual sales of more than billion 
the rate at which the company can integrate these recent acquisitions to meet the company s standards of profitability may affect near term financial results 
over the longer term  the company s ability both to make and to integrate strategic acquisitions will impact the company s financial results 
the company pursues internal growth by introducing new products  entering new domestic and international markets  adding new customers  cross selling existing product lines to current customers and supporting its us based customers international expansion 
the company s goal is to achieve an internal growth rate of per year  and over the last five years  has achieved an average of annual internal growth 
internal growth is defined by the company as growth from its core businesses  which include continuing businesses owned more than two years and minor acquisitions 
the company believes that its future internal growth will likely depend on its continued success in these areas  as well as external factors

at december  and 
at december the company believes that cash provided from operations and available borrowing facilities will continue to provide adequate support for the cash needs of existing businesses  however  certain events  such as significant acquisitions  could require additional external financing 
environmental matters as of december   the company was involved in various matters concerning federal and state environmental laws and regulations  including matters in which they have been identified by the us environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies as potentially responsible parties prps at contaminated sites under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla and equivalent state laws 
in assessing its environmental response costs  the company has considered several factors  including the extent of the company s volumetric contribution at each site relative to that of other prps  the kind of waste  the terms of existing cost sharing and other applicable agreements  the financial ability of other prps to share in the payment of requisite costs  the company s prior experience with similar sites  environmental studies and cost estimates available to the company  the effects of inflation on cost estimates  and the extent to which the company s and other parties status as prps are disputed

as of december   the company had a reserve equal to million for such environmental response costs in the aggregate 
no insurance recovery was taken into account in determining the company s cost estimates or reserve  nor do the company s cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes 
because of the uncertainties associated with environmental investigations and response activities  the possibility that the company could be identified as a prp at sites identified in the future that require the incurrence of environmental response costs and the possibility of additional sites as a result of businesses acquired  actual costs to be incurred by the company may vary from the company s estimates 
subject to difficulties in estimating future environmental response costs  the company does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of amounts reserved will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements 
market risk the company s market risk is impacted by changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and certain commodity prices 
pursuant to the company s policies  natural hedging techniques and derivative financial instruments may be utilized to reduce the impact of adverse changes in market prices 
the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes  and has no material sensitivity to changes in market rates and prices on its derivative financial instrument positions 
the company s primary market risk is interest rate exposure  primarily in the united states

due to the diversity of its product lines  the company does not have material sensitivity to any one commodity 
the company manages commodity price exposures primarily through the duration and terms of its vendor contracts 
based on the company s overall interest rate  currency rate and commodity price exposures at december   management of the company believes that a short term change in any of these exposures will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements of the company 
year computer compliance in order to address the year problem relating to the inability of certain computer software programs to process digit year date codes after december   the company has conducted a comprehensive review of its computer systems and formulated a plan to modify or replace programs where necessary
