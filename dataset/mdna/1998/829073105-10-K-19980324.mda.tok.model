the increase in net sales reflected sales growth throughout the united states  particularly in california and the northeastern region of the country 
international sales increased at a substantial rate  with a significant portion of this increase resulting from the businesses acquired earlier in the year 
contractor distributors and homecenters were the fastest growing connector sales channels 
the growth rate of simpson strong tie s epoxy  seismic and engineered wood product sales remained strong  and sst s acquisition of the isometric group s line of mechanical anchor products also contributed significantly to the increase in net sales 
simpson dura vent s sales of chimney products and direct vent products experienced above average growth 
gross profit gross profit increased to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to in from in the increase was primarily due to a reduction as a percentage of net sales in the non material components of cost of sales  including depreciation on factory equipment  research and development costs  labor  factory overhead costs and shipping and freight 
these costs decreased as a percentage of net sales primarily due to the improved absorption of fixed components of these costs because of the increased sales volume 
material costs as a percentage of net sales also decreased slightly relative to these improvements were offset somewhat by a smaller lifo gain recorded in as compared to selling expense selling expense increased to million in from million in  but decreased as a percentage of net sales 
the increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs  including agent commissions  related to the increase in the size of the sales force  which was expanded in to include manufacturers representatives who distribute the company s mechanical anchor product line 
this increase was offset slightly by reduced spending on advertising and promotional materials 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  and increased as a percentage of net sales 
the increase was primarily due to increased cash profit sharing  as a result of higher operating profit  as well as higher personnel costs  including those associated with the two acquisitions earlier in the year 
partially offsetting the increase was a decrease in expenses because of the write off of intangible assets related to simpson strong tie s operations in the uk 
acquired european operations the company recorded an after tax net loss in its combined european operations of million in  including million in intercompany interest charges  compared to after tax net losses of million in these losses are primarily associated with the company s uk operations 
depreciation on purchased capital equipment and administrative and other overhead costs incurred related to the growing operations contributed significantly to the losses 
the company expects the losses in the uk to continue through at least comparison of the years ended december  and net sales net sales in increased to million from million in net sales of simpson strong tie products increased to million in  while net sales of simpson dura vent products increased by to million in sdv accounted for of the company s total net sales  up from in the increases in net sales at both sst and sdv were primarily due to volume increases  with relatively small increases in average prices 
the increase in net sales occurred throughout the united states  but was particularly strong in the northeastern region of the country  primarily as a result of increased home center and dealer distributor business 
sales in california  however  grew at a rate substantially below the overall growth rate 
the company also had above average growth in export sales  a small but steadily growing part of both the connector and venting businesses 
the sales growth rate of diy  epoxy and seismic products led sst sales  and sales of direct vent products  now sold both to oems and through distributors  continued to experience strong growth 
gross profit gross profit in increased to million from million in gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in the increase was primarily due to three factors 
the first factor was a substantial benefit attributable to the lifo gain for the year as compared to a lifo loss in the prior year 
second  the non material component of cost of sales  which includes research and development costs  direct and indirect labor  factory costs and shipping and freight  decreased slightly as a percentage of net sales primarily due to the increased absorption of the fixed components of these costs resulting from increased sales volume 
finally  raw material costs decreased somewhat relative to labor costs as a percentage of net sales remained relatively flat during selling expense in  selling expense increased to million from million in the increase was primarily due to higher advertising and sales promotion expenses  a large percentage of which was targeted toward the retail business 
the company also hired several new retail specialists to support the increased home center and diy business and added several sales people 
in addition  the increased sales at simpson dura vent resulted in proportionately higher commissions and other related costs 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to higher cash profit sharing  as a result of higher operating profit  and the write off of intangible assets related to the company s uk operations see acquired operations below 
also contributing to the increase in general and administrative expense were increased personnel and overhead costs resulting from the addition of administrative staff  including those at the businesses acquired in the second half of interest income expense  net the company had interest income of  in as compared to  in the increase resulted from the higher cash and short term investment balances during the year 
provision for income taxes the company s effective tax rate increased to in from in the lower tax rate was principally a result of the full recognition of california investment tax credits on equipment purchased for manufacturing and research and development 
acquired operations the company s united kingdom operations continued to report losses 
while sales there have increased substantially since  largely because of acquisitions  current gross margins are substantially lower than those of the rest of the company s operations 
in december  the company completed the purchase of the assets  including  in equipment  of the builders products division of mitek industries ltd 
for approximately million 
as a result of this acquisition  the company concluded that additional manufacturing space was needed and that the consolidation of its uk facilities into a single location was advisable 
in connection with this consolidation  the company wrote off approximately million of intangible assets associated with the separate uk operations 
the company recorded after tax net losses in its european operations  including intercompany interest charges and the million charge discussed above  of approximately million in compared to after tax net losses of million in the losses were primarily due to depreciation on purchased capital equipment and administrative and other overhead costs incurred as a result of the growing operations 
the company expects these losses to continue through at least liquidity and sources of capital the company s liquidity needs arise principally from working capital requirements  capital expenditures and asset acquisitions 
during the three years ended december   the company relied primarily on internally generated funds and its credit facilities to finance these needs 
the company s working capital requirements are seasonal with the highest working capital needs typically occurring in the second and third quarters of the year 
cash and cash equivalents were million and million at december  and  respectively 
working capital was million and million at december  and  respectively 
as of december   the company had no significant debt and had available to it unused credit facilities of approximately million 
the company had cash flows from operating activities of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
in  cash was provided by net income of million  noncash expenses such as depreciation and amortization of million and increases in accrued profit sharing and other accrued liabilities totaling million 
the company s primary operating cash flow requirements resulted from increased levels of inventory and accounts receivable that are required as the company s sales increase 
in  and  the company used cash of million  million and million  respectively  to fund accounts receivable and inventory requirements 
in addition  trade accounts payable balances decreased and the deferred tax asset balance increased in  accounting for an aggregate use of an additional million in cash 
the balance of the cash used in resulted from changes in the other current asset and liability accounts 
cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
capital expenditures  related primarily to expanding capacity  increased in to million from million in included in the investing activities are the company s two acquisitions for a total of million 
the first was an equity purchase for million plus an earnout based on future sales increases of three canadian companies and a related us company  the isometric group  that manufactures and distributes a line of mechanical anchors and related products 
the second was the purchase of the remaining equity in patrick bellion  sa  a french manufacturer of connector products  for million 
in addition  million in cash was used for real estate and related purchases in partially offsetting these purchases was the sale of a short term investment providing nearly million in cash 
financing activities provided net cash of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the cash was provided primarily through the exercise of stock options by current and former employees of the company 
the company believes that cash generated by operations  borrowings available under its existing credit agreements  the majority of which have been renewed through june  and other available financing will be sufficient for the company s working capital needs and planned capital expenditures through at least inflation the company believes that the effect of inflation on the company has not been material in recent years  as inflation rates have remained low
