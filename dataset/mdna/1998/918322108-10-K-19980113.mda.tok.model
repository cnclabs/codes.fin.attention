liquidity and capital resources operating activities 
the company s three market segments have contrasting operating capital needs 
the marketing services sector requires considerable operating capital to support its accounts receivable and maintain its marketing infrastructure  while billing is periodic with little risk of non payment  client payment is typically slow 
the entertainment sector requires relatively little capital for operating purposes  because its clients typically pay sizable deposits before projects begin  make progress payments during project fabrication  and pay promptly upon project completion 
the operating capital needs of the retail sector ebb and flowwith seasonal periodic investment in merchandise inventory prior to  and its liquidation during and after back to school  holiday and spring fashion seasons 
the company has limited experience as a combined entity to determine whether the smaller entertainment and retail sectors will materially affect the relatively steady cash flow stream of the marketing services sector 
last year  company operations generated million cash flow 
fiscal year cash flow will be affected by the need to pay current taxes on income in excess of available net operating loss carryforwards 
the company presently expects operating income from the marketing services and entertainment sectors to increase in fiscal year toward the middle of fiscal year  the entertainment sector will begin to receive cash flow from the first of the missing links exhibits 
the amount will depend on attendance at museums and will initially be offset by operating expenses associated with installing the exhibits 
it is expected that the operating loss of the retail sector will continue to decrease  with its operating capital needs declining as store closings slow  and consignment goods replace merchandise inventory 
investing activities 
the marketing services sector acquired one building in fiscal year  and a second building in december however  capital expenditures for furniture  fixtures and equipment  and leasehold improvements for the marketing services sector will decline in fiscal year the entertainment sector requires no material capital improvements in fiscal year except for incremental investment for missing links exhibits 
the retail sector has no plans to relocate or open stores in fiscal year  and has no other material capital improvement planned
