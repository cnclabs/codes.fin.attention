item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview apache achieved record earnings and cash flow on both an absolute and per share basis during higher natural gas prices  while contributing to the year s improvements  were partially offset by lower oil prices 
more than product prices  the primary driver behind apache s record performance was increased production volumes  characterized by moderate growth in north american gas production and substantial increases in oil volumes abroad 
the year s million of earnings  coupled with a million conversion of debt to equity in november and million of cash provided before changes in working capital and other adjustments cash flow from operations  enabled apache to end with a debt to capitalization ratio of percent  up from percent in  despite million invested in exploration and development activities and million of property acquisitions 
at year end  approximately percent of apache s debt was locked in at fixed rates averaging percent 
other specifics include increased production and higher gas prices higher oil and gas production and natural gas prices contributed to record earnings and cash flow in egyptian oil development  a full year of production from egyptian properties acquired in  and north american gas drilling drove the increased production for apache s oil production increased percent from to  which added million to revenues 
natural gas production increased nine percent from to  which contributed million to the increase in revenues 
apache s average realized natural gas price for was up percent over  favorably impacting revenues by million 
debt refinancing in january  the company established a million commercial paper program and expanded that program in june to million 
apache also replaced its billion global borrowing base credit facility with a new billion global corporate credit facility in june apache issued million of senior unsecured year  percent debentures in august three of the company s egyptian subsidiaries entered into a million secured  revolving credit facility in october apache s australian finance subsidiary issued  in december  million of year  percent notes guaranteed by apache 
the company also received a rating upgrade on its senior and subordinated long term debt from standard poor s in january results of operations net income and revenue apache reported net income of million  an increase of percent or million over the increase is primarily due to higher oil and gas production  higher natural gas prices and lower operating costs per unit of production 
basic net income per common share rose to compared to in  diluted net income per common share increased to in from in net income of million for rose from million in basic net income per common share increased five fold in from 
in  diluted net income per common share was also 
in the increase was attributed to higher oil and gas prices and increased oil production 
revenues increased percent to billion in oil and natural gas production revenues increased percent  primarily due to increased oil and gas production and natural gas prices 
crude oil  including natural gas liquids  and natural gas contributed percent and percent  respectively  of total oil and gas production revenues during revenues increased percent in to million

the average price received in was 
per mcf  or percent  higher than the company periodically engages in hedging activities  including fixed price physical contracts and financial contracts 
apache realized gains from open hedging positions favorably impacting the gas price by 
per mcf 
losses under long term fixed price physical contracts negated the hedging gains reducing the gas price by 
per mcf 
the higher prices in were the result of favorable north american market conditions 
natural gas prices in australia declined in due to the effect of exchange rates on fixed australian dollar denominated gas contracts 
natural gas production for the united states increased four percent from to due to drilling results in the midcontinent and offshore regions 
canadian natural gas production increased percent due to acquisition and drilling activity 
natural gas production from australia increased percent from to australian production increases resulted primarily from a full year of production from the company s east spar properties  which came on line in november  and properties acquired in the ampolex group transaction 
natural gas revenues increased percent from to average natural gas prices were 
per mcf  or percent  higher in than the company s net hedging activity  including fixed price physical contracts and financial contracts reduced the reported prices by 
per mcf in  compared to a 
per mcf gain in natural gas production declined three percent from to  primarily due to the natural decline of older properties in the company s offshore and gulf coast regions and the sale of producing properties in late oil revenues increased percent from to egyptian oil production more than doubled from due to development activity and the first full year of production from the company s egyptian properties acquired in australian oil production increased percent from to due to the agincourt prospect 
these production increases were partially offset by a decrease of eight percent in average oil prices received during due to poor market conditions 
oil revenues increased percent from to  primarily due to properties acquired in connection with the phoenix merger and new egyptian production from the company s qarun field 
decreases in domestic production due to united states property sales in late  partially offset the impact of egyptian production 
the average oil price increased percent from to ngl revenues were slightly higher in than in ngl production increased percent from to  which was offset by a percent decrease in average prices 
ngl revenues increased percent from to average prices in were percent higher than in due to improved market conditions 
the increase in prices was partially offset by a seven percent decline in production 
other revenues and operating expenses gas gathering  processing and marketing revenues increased percent to million in from increased gas volumes and higher gas prices in drove this increase 
correspondingly  gas gathering  processing and marketing costs increased in by percent to million 
thus  lower margins were realized in lower crude oil trading margins and lower pipeline gathering fees were mitigated by higher gas purchase and resale margins in during  gas gathering  processing and marketing revenues increased percent to million from million in lower margins were also realized in as compared to equity in income loss of affiliates represents apache s share of proenergy losses 
equity in loss of affiliate was million and

full cost dd a expense increased in from million  or per boe  in apache s operating costs increased three percent to million in from million in lease operating expense loe  excluding severance taxes  increased from million in to million in loe increased as a result of egyptian oil production enhancements and north american gas production gains 
on an equivalent barrel basis  loe for averaged per boe  a 
decline from per boe in production increased with a lower incremental loe than the average per unit cost 
specifically  north american gas production and egyptian oil production carry much lower per unit costs than the property profile 
the divestiture of marginal properties in the us also favorably impacted loe per boe in operating costs increased seven percent in from million in loe  excluding severance taxes  increased three percent in from million in loe per boe increased three percent in from per boe in the increase was driven by a flat domestic cost structure with declining production in the gulf coast region 
the phoenix acquisition in also increased loe per boe 
mitigating these increases was decreased loe per boe in the midcontinent region due to incremental production added through the drillbit 
administrative  selling and other costs increased million  or six percent  from to under a new bonus plan initiated in  apache provided incentive compensation to all employees based on the achievement of targeted performance  which was the primary reason for the increase 
on an equivalent barrel basis  general and administrative g a expense declined from 
per boe in to 
per boe in production increases were not met with rising administrative costs 
administrative  selling and other costs were lower in than in due to the company s continuing efforts to control costs 
on an equivalent barrel basis  g a expense declined two percent in from

additional capitalized interest of million in mitigated these increases 
capitalized interest is based on the carrying value of unproved properties 
higher international unevaluated costs caused the increase in net financing costs for decreased million  or percent  from the prior year due to higher amounts of capitalized interest  partially offset by higher gross interest costs 
capitalized interest increased million for due to an increase in the unproved property base resulting from acquisitions made in and gross interest expense increased million for as compared to average outstanding debt increased million compared to offsetting this increase was a decline of 
percent in apache s weighted average interest rate 
market risk commodity risk the company s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its oil and gas production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to its united states and canadian natural gas production 
historically  prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable 
pricing volatility is expected to continue 
gas price realizations ranged from a monthly low of per mcf to a monthly high of per mcf during oil prices ranged from a low of per barrel to a high of per barrel during the same period 
the company periodically enters into hedging activities with respect to a portion of its projected oil and natural gas production through a variety of financial and physical arrangements intended to support oil and natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage its exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations 
apache may use futures contracts  swaps  options and fixed price physical contracts to hedge its commodity prices 
realized gains or losses from the company s price risk management activities are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the associated production occurs 
apache does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
in  apache recognized a net gain of million from hedging activities that increased oil and gas production revenues 
the net gain in includes million in derivative income and million in losses on fixed price physical gas contracts 
in  apache recognized a net loss from hedging activities of million 
gains or losses on natural gas derivative contracts are expected to be offset by sales at the spot market price or to preserve the margin on existing physical contracts 
a percent improvement in year end spot market prices would increase the fair value of derivative contracts in effect at december  by million  while a percent fall in spot prices would decrease the fair value of these instruments by million 
hedging activity relative to oil production resulted in a 
million gain in the company did not have any open positions with respect to crude oil hedging at december  interest rate risk the company considers its interest rate risk exposure minimal as a result of fixing interest rates on over two thirds of the company s debt 
total debt at december   included about million of floating rate debt 
as a result  apache s annual interest costs in will fluctuate based on short term interest rates on approximately percent of its total debt outstanding at december  the impact on annual cash flow of a percent change in the floating rate approximately basis points would be million 
foreign currency risk the company s cash flow stream relating to certain international operations is based on the us dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies 
australia gas production is sold under fixed price australian dollar contracts and substantially all capital expenditures and operating costs are paid in australian dollars 
revenue and disbursement transactions denominated in australian dollars are converted to us dollar equivalents based on the exchange rate on the transaction date 
reported cash flow relating to canadian operations is based on cash flows measured in canadian dollars converted to the us dollar equivalent based on the average of the canadian and us dollar exchange rates for the period reported 
substantially all of the company s international transactions  outside of canada and australia  are denominated in us dollars 
the company s canadian and australian subsidiaries have net financial obligations that are denominated in a currency other than the functional reporting currency of the subsidiaries 
a decrease in value of percent in the australian and canadian dollars relative to the us dollar from the year end exchange rates would result in a foreign currency loss of approximately million  based on december  amounts 
the company considers its current risk exposure to exchange rate movements  based on net cash flows  to be immaterial 
the company did not have any open derivative contracts relating to foreign currencies at december  cash flow  liquidity and capital resources capital commitments apache s primary needs for cash are for exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas properties  repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt  payment of dividends  and capital obligations for affiliated ventures 
the company funds its exploration and development activities through internally generated cash flows 
apache budgets its capital expenditures based upon projected cash flows 
the company routinely adjusts its capital expenditures in response to changes in oil and natural gas prices and cash flow 
the company cannot predict future product prices 
capital expenditures apache s oil and gas capital expenditures over the last three years are summarized below in thousands exploration and development united states    canada    egypt    australia    ivory coast    other international    total    acquisitions of oil and gas properties    expenditures for exploration and development totaled million in compared to million in apache s drilling program in added mmboe of reserves including revisions and replaced percent of production

on november   the company  acquired all the capital stock of three companies owning interests in certain oil and gas properties including mmboe of proved oil and natural gas reserves and production facilities offshore western australia for approximately million pursuant to three agreements with subsidiaries of mobil 
funds for the ampolex group transaction were obtained principally from borrowings under the company s global credit facility 
the ampolex group transaction  net of the sale of certain properties to hardy petroleum limited hardy  increased the company s interest to percent from percent in the carnarvon basin s harriet area  which includes the varanus island pipeline  processing and production complex and eight existing oil and gas fields 
in addition  the company s interest in the east spar field  which produces through the varanus island facilities  increased to percent from percent 
apache operates the harriet east spar properties 
in conjunction with the closing of the ampolex group transaction on december   the company entered into an agreement with hardy under which hardy agreed to purchase a percent interest in the company s east spar gas field and related production facilities in western australia 
the transaction closed on january  with a total sales price of approximately million in cash 
in  the company also completed tactical regional acquisitions for cash consideration totaling million 
these acquisitions added approximately mmboe to the company s reserves 
cash expenditures for acquisitions of proved oil and gas properties during totaled million compared to million in the company added mmboe of proved oil and gas reserves through purchases in the most significant transaction completed in was the merger with phoenix

debt and interest commitments at december   apache had outstanding debt of million under its global credit facility and an aggregate of  million of other debt 
this other debt included notes and debentures maturing in the years through debt outstanding at december  of billion was up percent over the billion outstanding at december  the increase reflects the ampolex group transaction and other property acquisitions 
the company s debt to capitalization ratio increased from percent at december  to percent at december  apache s debt to capitalization ratio for january fell below percent due in part to the conversion of percent of the million percent debentures into approximately million shares of apache common stock 
interest payments on the company s debt for are projected to be million using weighted average balances for floating rate obligations 
scheduled principal payments for total million 
dividend payments dividends paid during totaled million  up eight percent from  due to the increased number of shares outstanding 
the company has paid cash dividends on its common stock for consecutive quarters through december   and expects to continue payment of dividends at current levels 
future dividend payments will depend on the company s level of earnings  financial requirements and other relevant factors 
capital resources and liquidity the company s primary capital resources are net cash provided by operating activities  proceeds from financing activities and proceeds from sales of non strategic assets 
net cash provided by operating activities apache s net cash provided by operating activities during totaled million  an increase of percent from the million provided in this increase was due primarily to higher oil and gas production and higher gas prices in the receipt of million from a purchaser as an advance also impacted net cash provided by operating activities 
this advance was for future natural gas deliveries of  mmbtu per day over a ten year period commencing september net cash provided by operating activities in rose million from primarily due to higher product prices 
long term borrowings in january  the company established a million commercial paper program that allows apache to borrow funds for up to days at competitive interest rates 
the commercial paper program is supported by availability under the us portion of apache s global credit facility 
in june  the company expanded its commercial paper program to million from million to provide access to additional low cost  short term funds 
since its inception in january  the commercial paper program has been rated a  prime and d d one minus by standard poor s s p  moody s and duff and phelps  respectively 
also in january  s p upgraded the company s senior long term debt rating from bbb to bbb and subordinated long term debt rating from bbb to bbb 
apache was also named to the s p in in june  the company replaced its billion global borrowing base credit facility with a new billion global credit facility that provides apache with greater borrowing capacity  increased financial flexibility and less restrictive covenants  while lowering its all in borrowing cost by basis points 
the global credit facility consists of three separate bank facilities a million facility in the us  a million facility in australia  and a million facility in canada 
the global credit facility enables apache to draw on the entire billion facility without restrictions tied to periodic revaluation of the company s oil and gas reserves 
in august  apache issued million principal amount  million net of discount  of senior unsecured percent debentures maturing on august  the proceeds from this issuance were used to reduce the company s outstanding commercial paper obligations and for general corporate purposes 
the company terminated two secured credit facilities with the ifc in october this financing was replaced with a secured  revolving credit facility that provides total commitments of million and an initial borrowing base of million 
this borrowing base will be redetermined semi annually 
the total amount of commitments under the facility is currently scheduled to be reduced by set increments every six months  beginning two and one half years after the effective date of the facility 
the facility is scheduled to mature on january  in december  apache finance pty ltd  an australian finance subsidiary  issued million principal amount  million net of discount  of percent notes due on december  apache irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed the notes  and has the right to redeem the notes prior to maturity  subject to certain conditions 
the proceeds from this issuance were used to repay funds borrowed for the ampolex group transaction and general corporate purposes 
in february  apache issued million principal amount  million net of discount  of senior unsecured percent notes maturing on february  the notes are not redeemable prior to maturity 
net proceeds from the sale were used to reduce existing short term obligations and for general corporate purposes 
stock transactions in november  all the company s percent convertible notes were converted into approximately million shares of apache common stock 
the notes were converted at a rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount 
in january  approximately percent  or million  of the company s percent debentures were converted into million shares of apache common stock at a conversion rate of approximately shares of common stock per  principal amount 
the remaining million principal amount was redeemed for million in cash  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
asset sales apache received million in both and from the sale of non strategic oil and gas properties in a number of separate transactions 
in january  apache closed the sale of a percent interest in apache s east spar gas field and related production facilities in western australia for approximately million in cash 
apache used the proceeds to reduce outstanding loans under the australian portion of the global credit facility 
liquidity the company had million in cash and cash equivalents on hand at december   down from million at december  apache s ratio of current assets to current liabilities increased from 
at december   to at december  management believes that cash on hand  net cash generated from operations and unused committed borrowing capacity under its global credit facility will be adequate to satisfy the company s financial obligations to meet future liquidity needs for at least the next two fiscal years 
as of december   apache s available borrowing capacity under its global credit facility was million 
impact of the year issue the year issue is the result of computer software being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year if left unremediated  this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send oil and gas revenue disbursement checks  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company is in the process of replacing significant portions of its software to more effectively and efficiently meet its business needs 
replacement computer systems selected by the company will properly recognize dates beyond december  the company presently believes that with conversions to new software  the year issue will be eliminated 
however  if such conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company plans to replace substantially all of its existing systems within months or not later than march  the date on which the company plans to complete installation of its new system is based on management s best estimates  which were derived using numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  and similar uncertainties 
future trends apache s strategy is to increase its oil and gas reserves  production and cash flow by continuing to explore on and develop its inventory of existing projects and making carefully targeted acquisitions of new assets 
robust oil and gas prices early in gave way to weaker prices later in the year and on into crude oil prices have fallen near their lowest level of the s 
while lower prices are expected to negatively impact apache s earnings and cash from operations see  market risk commodity risk above and item business oil and natural gas prices  full cost center ceiling test  reserves  rates of production  development expenditures  cash flow  and effect of volatile prices  apache has taken steps to improve its financial liquidity for the purpose of better positioning the company to fund potential opportunities that might result from industry adversity 
specific actions that may be or have been taken which should impact the company s activities in and beyond include selling and trading non strategic properties to upgrade the company s property portfolio and reduce debt 
curtailing projected exploration and development expenditures to remain within cash from operations 
calling for redemption of million of debentures of which percent or million were converted to equity in january the above steps should strengthen apache s financial position and add liquidity 
should property acquisition prices fall from the premium price commanded in to what management believes to be more reasonable levels  apache may seek to undertake a significant acquisition 
alternatively  if drilling costs retreat further from the levels to which they rose in  apache may expand its drilling activity 
in either event  apache expects to review the level of its capital expenditures quarterly in light of financial results  product prices  drilling costs and prevailing industry conditions 
even at a reduced capital expenditure level  apache expects to remain an active operator in north america drilling moderate risk wells 
apache s international properties should continue to grow in importance with respect to apache s financial results and future growth prospects 
apache s international efforts in the coming year will be focused on development of its discoveries in egypt  offshore western australia  offshore the people s republic of china and offshore the ivory coast  and exploration efforts on the company s concessions in egypt and its new properties in poland 
while international exploration is recognized as higher risk than apache s north american activities  the company believes it offers potential for greater rewards and significant reserve additions 
apache also believes that reserve additions in these international areas may be made through higher risk exploration and through improved production practices and recovery techniques 
forward looking statements and risk certain statements in this report  including statements of the future plans  objectives  and expected performance of the company  are forward looking statements that are dependent on certain events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside the company s control which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
some of these include  but are not limited to  economic and competitive conditions  inflation rates  legislative and regulatory changes  financial market conditions  political and economic uncertainties of foreign governments  future business decisions  and other uncertainties  all of which are difficult to predict 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures 
the total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from reserves and production estimates 
the drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks including those related to timing  success rates and cost overruns 
lease and rig availability  complex geology and other factors can affect these risks 
future oil and gas prices also could affect results of operations and cash flows 
although apache makes use of futures contracts  swaps  options and fixed price physical contracts to mitigate risk  fluctuations in oil and gas prices may affect the company s financial position and results of operations
