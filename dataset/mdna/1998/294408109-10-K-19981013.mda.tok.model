see special note regarding forward looking statements 
overview because of the continued erosion of market share and continuing declines in cash flow  equalnet corporation equalnet  one of the company s wholly owned subsidiaries  and equalnet wholesale services  inc wholesale  a non operating wholly owned subsidiary of equalnet  filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter chapter of the united states bankruptcy code the bankruptcy code on september  the petition date in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of texas the bankruptcy court  houston  texas 
the cases are not being jointly administered at this time and are pending in such court as cases no 
h and h pursuant to sections and of the bankruptcy code  equalnet  as debtor and debtor in possession  expects to continue to manage and operate equalnet s assets and business pending the confirmation of a plan of reorganization and subject to the supervision and orders of the bankruptcy court 
on october   wholesale filed its motion to convert its bankruptcy proceeding from a chapter reorganization to a chapter liquidation 
equalnet s long distance volume declined from million monthly minutes in june to million monthly minutes in june substantially all of equalnet s revenues have been derived from the sale of long distance services to small business customers 
the source of these accounts is primarily independent marketing agents and the acquisition of customer accounts of other resellers 
many of these agents previously marketed equalnet s long distance products via telemarketing 
the reduction in minutes can be partially attributed to at t becoming much more cost competitive 
many of these customers have been offered and accepted lower prices from other long distance vendors as well as at t 
equalnet s revenue per minute averaged approximately in june  whereas at t and other long distance vendors currently market the same service for or less per minute 
equalnet does not intend to market its services to new customers until a plan of reorganization is approved 
during the first three quarters of fiscal  equalnet s primary costs  its costs of sales  were variable and consisted of the underlying wholesale cost of long distance services from its underlying providers  commissions to independent agents and billing costs 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  equalnet entered into an agreement with netco to provide for operation of netco s nine switches switches and build out of network facilities in exchange for the right to carry traffic over the network thus equalnet became a switch based carrier with new fixed costs primarily maintenance and network management 
since equalnet did not have the customer density to support the costs associated with the network facilities  equalnet incurred losses which created even larger cash flow deficits 
equalnet generated revenue through orders received from independent marketing agents and by acquiring the customer accounts of several other resellers 
equalnet historically acquired customer accounts from independent marketing agents on an individual price per order basis  with some agents receiving an initial payment to help defer the cost of acquiring the orders which would be offset by future commissions earned agent advances and others receiving a higher initial payment with no future commission owed deferred acquisition costs 
this allowed equalnet to use the agents as a vehicle to outsource telemarketing activities 
expenditures associated with individually acquired orders  both advanced and purchased  totaled approximately million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the operational problems encountered as a result of the attempted conversion from the netbase system to ams kept equalnet from being able to calculate and pay its marketing agents the commissions due them on either a timely or regular basis 
in addition  these operational problems resulted in delays in provisioning new customer orders from some of these agents  causing delays in generating revenues from these customers  and in some instances  the loss of new customer orders 
these delays also adversely impacted revenues and cash flows for the company 
as a result  the company s and equalnet s relationships with marketing agents have deteriorated 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the company s selling  general and administrative costs are primarily the costs of back office operations including billing  provisioning and customer service 
the company also has devoted significant resources to the information technology necessary to support customer service and the network of independent marketing agents 
the company is currently purchasing its third information system  either purchased or internally developed  within eighteen months 
the company reported for federal income tax purposes as an s corporation under the internal revenue code of  as amended  until its reorganization in connection with its initial public offering in march  and was similarly treated for state income tax purposes under comparable state laws 
reorganization of equalnet corporation on september   equalnet  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company and wholesale  a non operating subsidiary of equalnet filed for protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
in the initial bankruptcy filing  equalnet reported total assets of million and total liabilities of million 
as of that date  the largest individual creditor of equalnet was the company  which was owed approximately million  representing approximately of equalnet s total recorded liabilities 
equalnet will file schedules of assets and liabilities with the bankruptcy court in the near future 
on october  wholesale filed its motion to convert its bankruptcy proceeding from a chapter reorganization to a chapter liquidation 
equalnet s bankruptcy may make it difficult for the company to obtain services from vendors of equalnet or otherwise maintain those vendor relationships or relationships with equalnet s marketing agents 
consequently  there can be no assurance that the bankruptcy of equalnet will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
although equalnet s filing was a voluntary petition  it was in default on its debt and was in arrears on most of its vendor payables 
other than the company  the largest creditor of equalnet is at t  which is owed approximately million 
this amount does not include any claims at t may assert arising from equalnet s msarc obligations pursuant to its contract with at t 
based on the current shortfall  the liability could be significantly higher 
in the event equalnet rejects its contract with at t  the remaining commitments due under that contract could become a part of at t s claim in the bankruptcy proceeding  substantially increasing the amount of the claims of equalnet s creditors 
although it did not own them  equalnet was the entity that operated the network of nine switches  and it has incurred a substantial amount of additional indebtedness to vendors associated with those operations 
equalnet intends to seek to reorganize its business under bankruptcy protection 
the goal is to stabilize its operations and substantially improve its balance sheet 
through the reorganization  equalnet hopes to retain a substantial portion of its customer base  reduce its liabilities  improve the efficiency of its operations  and reduce its operating and administrative costs 
equalnet s customer base represented substantially all of the company s consolidated group s revenue in the fiscal year ended june  however  as a result of the acquisition of sa telecom s customer base and assets on july   equalnet s revenues are currently approximately one half of the consolidated group s revenues 
as of june   equalnet s non affiliate liabilities of approximately million represented of the consolidated group s liabilities  and the book basis of its assets  approximately million  represented approximately of the consolidated group s assets 
in order for equalnet to successfully reorganize  it must successfully negotiate new carrier agreements  arrange adequate assurance with its vendors during the pendency of the reorganization  improve the efficiency of its back office operations and reduce overhead to generate positive cash flow  retain a substantial portion of its customer base and obtain the approval of creditors of a plan of reorganization 
failure to achieve any of these items could lead to a liquidation of equalnet 
equalnet intends to move as quickly as possible to submit a plan of reorganization to its creditors and work toward its approval in the near future 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the fiscal periods indicated the percentages of total sales represented by certain items reflected in the company s consolidated statements of income and expenses percentage of total revenues fiscal year ended june  total sales cost of sales gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization write down of long term assets operating income loss other income expense interest income interest expense miscellaneous income loss before federal income taxes and extraordinary item provision benefit for federal income taxes net income loss year ended june   compared to year ended june  total sales 
long distance sales decreased from million for fiscal year to million in fiscal year the decrease was due primarily to a decrease in the number of customer accounts and a corresponding decrease in billable minutes 
the decline in revenues in fiscal year was the result of an increased rate of attrition on existing customers and a decline in completed order activity 
the company s average price to its at t customer base was approximately per minute 
this is considerably higher than competitors who have intensely marketed these customers 
to counter this attrition  equalnet focused the efforts of its independent marketing agents to utilize the underlying networks of carriers other than at t  but the company experienced considerable difficulty provisioning these new customers because of the conversion problems with the ams system 
total cost of sales 
long distance cost of sales decreased from million for fiscal year to million in fiscal the decrease was due primarily to a decrease in the company s total sales 
the company s cost of sales as a percentage of revenue deteriorated from in fiscal year to in fiscal year if the same percentage of revenue would have been maintained throughout fiscal year  the cost of sales would have been approximately million 
the additional million in cost of sales is due primarily to fixed and variable costs associated with the network which were not incurred in fiscal year with the acquisition of netco  the company decided to provision a nationwide network which could originate  transport  and terminate the new traffic generated by the independent marketing agents 
commission expense as a percentage of total sales increased from to 
commission expense includes advances to agents that are not expected to be recovered through future commissions earned by those agents 
these advances were made because of provisioning problems 
in order to retain the agents  the company advanced funds to the agents based on estimated revenues that could have been generated by them if the provisioning problems had not occurred 
because of provisioning problems and high attrition rates among these new customers  the revenue expected from the agents was never attained 
billing expense increased from of total sales in fiscal year to of total sales in fiscal year because of the transition to the ams billing system 
the need to generate the same invoice multiple times and high consulting costs were problems with this system 
bad debt expense increased from of total sales to due primarily to the billing problems 
customers routinely received their invoices late  in some cases two months late  especially in the fourth quarter and many were unwilling to pay the amount due 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year selling  general  and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales from to for the years ended and  respectively 
the increase in this ratio was due to a decline in total sales without a corresponding reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses 
until late in fiscal year  the company s infrastructure continued to be more appropriate for a substantially larger company 
payroll expenses in fiscal year increased as a percentage of total revenues from in fiscal year to 
this was due to the acquisition of personnel knowledgeable in switch technology and computer programming related to the new billing system which accounted for an increase in costs of approximately million 
during fiscal year  there were two proxies 
this resulted in an increase in accounting  professional and legal fees of million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  management re evaluated the value of certain assets 
the netbase billing system  accounts receivable from cyberserve  inc and wshs enterprises  inc 
bluegate  accounts receivable from uns  and agent advances  were written down to net realizable values 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization decreased as the company recorded million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the company wrote down assets of approximately million and million during the years ended june  and  respectively 
during fiscal year  the company recorded a charge to earnings for million to reduce the carrying value of purchased customer accounts to an estimate of future discounted cash flows from the purchased accounts 
operating loss 
the operating loss increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year other income expense 
other expenses decreased by million or from fiscal year to fiscal year this reduction is primarily due to the payment of penalties  settlement costs  and legal fees which were accrued in fiscal year these accruals were associated with complaints against the company by various state regulatory agencies on behalf of customers 
in fiscal year  there was also a  expense recorded in this account for the failed unified network services joint venture  these expenses were not incurred during fiscal year year ended june   compared to year ended june  total sales 
long distance sales decreased  from million in fiscal to million for the year ended june  the decrease was due primarily to a decrease in the number of customer accounts and a corresponding decrease in billable minutes 
the decline in revenues in fiscal year was the result of an increased rate of attrition on existing customers and a decline in order activity beginning in the last half of fiscal year the company began reducing order activity in early calendar to reduce the incidence of loss due to delayed provisioning times at at t and because it discovered a new customer management system was severely hampering the company s ability to provision and service new customers 
the company slowly began increasing order activity once it had reverted to the original netbase system and provisioning times had returned to acceptable levels  however  the company began experiencing liquidity problems during this time frame and has been unable to fund agent advances that stimulate order activity as significant as those experienced prior to january total cost of sales 
the company s cost of sales  which are variable  decreased from million in fiscal to million for the year ended june   a decrease of 
this decrease was a result of a decrease in the company s sales 
the company s cost of long distance which is a component of cost of sales improved as a percentage of sales  decreasing from to for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the improvement in the percentage is the result of the renegotiation of the company s contracts with its carriers and from the recognition of a one time credit from at t 
the company negotiated an improvement in the interstate rate it receives from at t in may followed by an improvement again in november and another improvement in may additionally  the company was granted a one time credit of million as part of the new contract with at t  effective may  and a  backlog of carrier disputes being processed by the company and credited by the company s carriers in march the carrier dispute backlog was the result of difficulties at t encountered in processing the company s disputed long distance usage which had accumulated over an extended period of time 
commission expense as a percentage of sales decreased from to 
commission expense included a million charge and  charge for fiscal years and  respectively  to expense advances to agents that are not expected to be recovered through future commissions earned by those agents 
commissions as a percentage of revenues without these charges would be and for fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease relates in part to a payment in the second quarter of fiscal to a principal agent to reduce the agent s commission rate by approximately 
of the company s total sales during fiscal years and  and  respectively  were derived from customers introduced to the company from this agent 
the company shifted its sales strategy from that of purchasing customer accounts and bases of customer accounts  which have very little associated commission expense  to one of advancing commissions to independent marketing agents for individual customer accounts 
billing expense as a percentage of sales increased from to for the fiscal years ending and  respectively  as a result of the company beginning to bill a significant portion of its customers through local exchange carriers lecs 
billings through the lecs represented of the company s revenues for the year ended june  the cost of billing through lecs is generally greater than billing customers through independent billing companies  however  the company believed that by billing customers through the lecs  savings would also be recognized by decreased bad debt expense and reduced customer attrition 
in addition  because the majority of customer service was performed by the lecs  the company had been able to reduce overhead related to the cost of servicing these customers directly 
bad debt expense decreased from of sales in fiscal year to of sales in fiscal year the company s collection efforts were hindered in fiscal by the failure of a new customer management system to produce the necessary information to allow for the most effective method of collection  resulting in a higher than normal incident of uncollected accounts 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from million for the year ended june   to million for the same period in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales from to for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the decrease in this expense was a result of cost reduction efforts by the company 
total staff decreased from an average of temporary and permanent employees during the year ended june  permanent employees at june  to an average of temporary and permanent employees in fiscal permanent employees at june  
salary related expense decreased million from fiscal to fiscal as a result of the decrease in personnel 
administrative expense was down  for fiscal compared to fiscal as the result of decreasing supplies and office expense by  and due to a reduction in corporate long distance and telephone related expenses by  the decrease in long distance and phone related expenses was related to the acquisition of a new telephone system in january which allowed the company to significantly reduce hold times  thereby reducing long distance costs  and due to the decrease in the number of customers  resulting in fewer calls 
additionally  the company incurred  in acquisition related costs in early fiscal which were not present in fiscal these savings were offset somewhat by an increase in bank fees  marketing fees  lease expense and the addition of creative and its related overhead 
the company incurred approximately  in additional legal and professional fees in fiscal as compared to fiscal included in professional fees are fees paid to third party verification companies which the company utilized to verify customer orders 
these fees totaled approximately  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal bank fees increased as a result of the cost of obtaining an amendment to the company s loan agreement 
marketing fees increased as the company conducted an aggressive campaign related to the placement of long distance calling cards with all of its customers 
lease expense increased  from fiscal to fiscal due to the company entering into two significant leases beginning in january for a new telephone system and for computer equipment to support the company s information system network 
creative communications  an operating division of the company  resulted in an additional  in selling  general and administrative expenses to support its operations  which were acquired by the company in fiscal depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased slightly as the company recorded million and million in expense during and  respectively 
the company expended very little on capital equipment during fiscal and returned to compensating agents through commissions and advances on commissions 
the company wrote down assets of approximately million and million during the years ended june  and  respectively 
during fiscal the company recorded a charge to earnings for million to reduce the carrying value of purchased customer accounts to an estimate of future discounted cash flows from the purchased accounts 
included in the write down in fiscal was a similar million non cash charge to reduce the carrying value of acquired customer bases to the present value of the expected future cash flows associated with the underlying customer accounts and a million write off of capitalized software development costs associated with the netbase system 
the write down of deferred acquisition costs was necessitated by a greater than expected turnover of acquired customer bases which resulted from difficulties in billing and servicing the underlying customer accounts 
operating loss 
the operating loss increased from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  other income expense 
other expense increased from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense of  from fiscal to fiscal and an increase in miscellaneous expense of  from fiscal to fiscal the increase in interest expense was the result of the increase in the interest rate under the company s bank line of credit and the addition of the note payable to furst 
other expense in fiscal includes a  accrual for possible penalties  settlement costs and legal expenses associated with the resolution of pending complaints against the company by various state regulatory agencies with regard to customer complaints 
fiscal includes an additional  for settlements reached in fiscal see item  legal proceedings 
other expense also included  and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  in losses related to the failed unified network services joint venture  which the company entered into in february liquidity and capital resources the company recorded net losses of million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the company funded its operations during the year ended june  through extension of payment terms from the company s suppliers  fundings under equalnet s receivables purchase agreement  from investments totaling million from private placements with several accredited investors and through operating cash flows 
equalnet s funding availability under a receivables purchase arrangement declined principally as a result of declining revenues and billing and collections difficulties experienced as a result of equalnet s conversion to the ams billing system 
at current levels of operations and with a declining revenue base  the company may seek additional capital and continued concessions from its vendors and may need to continue to reduce expenses to bring them in line with current levels of revenues 
there can be no assurances that the company can reduce its expenses enough to achieve a break even in cash flow 
to date  the external funds necessary to fund the company s capital requirements arising from capital expenditures  acquisitions and working capital have been provided primarily from asset based financing  third party sources of capital and the proceeds from the company s initial public offering 
maximum borrowings under the company s line of credit increased from  in to million in equalnet replaced the credit facility under which borrowings at june  were outstanding with a new facility with rfc capital corporation rfc effective june  and which funded july  rfc purchases equalnet s receivables and unbilled call detail records and periodically remits back to equalnet excess collections over amounts funded less financing fees 
the maximum allowable amount of funding under the rfc facility originally was million and was increased to million in july equalnet s receivables purchase agreement at june  provided for a funding base that was dependent upon the amount and aging of accounts receivable and unbilled call detail records 
rfc may cease funding of new receivables without prior written notice at its option 
financing charges on the outstanding balance was prime plus per annum currently prime plus 
should rfc cease to provide financing in accordance with its option  equalnet would be forced to seek immediate replacement of the facility to provide working capital 
current sources of funds from operations and working capital would be insufficient to provide funds adequate to continue funding operations 
on september   the bankruptcy court approved an interim order approving a debtor in possession dip financing through rfc for equalnet which allows equalnet to continue to finance its receivables on the same basis as the pre petition financing 
a hearing to consider the final approval of the dip financing is scheduled on october  if the dip financing is not approved  it is unlikely equalnet will have the working capital needed to continue business 
equalnet s contract with at t  which expires in april  specifies the pricing of the services provided to equalnet by at t and establishes minimum semi annual revenue commitments msarc which must be met to receive the contractual price and to avoid shortfall penalties 
at june   equalnet had not reached the completion of the term of the third msarc  however  equalnet was substantially below the cumulative pro rata monthly commitment 
the total shortfall for this msarc is estimated to be million 
at t provides such services to equalnet pursuant to a long term contract which may be rejected in bankruptcy proceedings 
if the existing contract with at t is terminated  either by equalnet through a rejection of the existing contract pursuant to the bankruptcy proceedings or by at t for non payment  prior to the expiration of the full term without execution of a new contract  equalnet could be liable for the total amount of the unsatisfied msarc for the period in which the discontinuance occurs and for of the msarcs for each semi annual period remaining in the contract tariff term 
the msarcs for year two of the contract are million each 
the msarcs for year three are million each 
historically  equalnet has been able to negotiate a settlement of such shortfalls with at t which has resulted in no penalty being incurred by equalnet 
if equalnet does not reject its contract with at t in bankruptcy  no assurances can be made that equalnet will be able to reach similar settlements with at t should it continue to fail to meet its commitment 
should equalnet be unable to reach a settlement with the carrier  it would be required to fund the resulting penalties through its operating cash flow  funds available under its existing financing arrangement and working capital 
if required at this time  such funds would not be available to meet the commitments when due and at t could terminate equalnet s underlying service 
in the event equalnet rejects the at t contract  equalnet could seek to renegotiate an alternative contract with at t  subscribe for other at t tariffed services or seek to acquire wholesale services through other large customers of at t 
cash flow from operations 
the company generated used net cash of  and  in operating activities in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
cash from net losses adjusted for non cash expenses decreased from a use of cash of million in fiscal to a use of cash of million in fiscal this use in fiscal was offset by the change in operating assets and liabilities  including a million change in accounts receivable  a million change in accounts payable and a  decrease in prepaid expenses and other 
accounts receivable decreased as revenues continued to decline throughout fiscal accounts payable  particularly the payable to providers of long distance  increased as a result of equalnet s inability to pay its vendors on a timely basis

working capital and long cash cycle 
customer billings for long distance services are generated from detailed calls records which are generally available  from the carriers on a weekly basis following the previous week s customer usage  and from the switches on a daily basis following the day of customer usage 
customer invoices usually are generated  on a monthly basis for the direct billed customers and weekly for the lec billed customers and are due upon receipt by the customer 
however  the company historically collects a large portion of receivables after the scheduled due date  resulting in an average cash cycle of in excess of days 
since the company s underlying carriers typically have required payment within days following the month of usage  delays in receipt of customer payments have resulted in significant working capital needs 
during the fourth fiscal quarter  equalnet was not able to continue to pay at t either installments under its payment plan for usage in arrears or for current usage on or before days from the date of invoice  and did not make some payments when due 
in order to avoid termination of service  equalnet agreed in the first fiscal quarter of to send daily payments to at t in amounts approximating the costs equalnet would incur from at t for providing such services

during fiscal  the company had expenditures of million on capital items  including million to purchase the switches 
the company has minimal planned capital expenditures budgeted for fiscal year other than expenditures associated with the costguard billing system 
taxes sales taxes 
an improper treatment of sales taxes arose from the company s failure to remit the sales tax due to various taxing authorities on the incremental component of revenue in excess of the cost of the underlying service for which taxes were properly paid 
at june  equalnet had an accrual of  for resolution of this matter 
the company believes that the amount accrued is adequate for the satisfaction of this tax liability  including any interest payable

income taxes 
the company has gross deferred tax assets of million for which a valuation allowance of million has been established 
the deferred tax assets arise from deductible temporary differences of million and a net operating loss carryforward of million 
in assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance  the company considered its inability to generate taxable income in recent periods  the facts and circumstances which led to the significant operating loss incurred in the years ended june  and  and projections of future taxable income 
financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  allows for the recognition of deferred tax assets by considering  among other things  the ability of the company to generate future taxable income 
a valuation allowance is required to reduce tax assets to their expected realizability if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
statement explicitly provides that reaching a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
the company has been in a cumulative loss position at june  the company does not believe that positive evidence of the ability to generate future taxable income is sufficient to counteract the negative evidence  the cumulative losses  and accordingly has recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of the deferred tax

seasonality the company s long distance revenue is subject to seasonal variations 
because most of the company s revenue is generated by non residential customers  the company traditionally experiences decreases in long distance usage and revenue in those periods with holidays 
in past years the company s long distance traffic  which is primarily non residential  has declined slightly during the quarter ending december due to the november and december holiday periods 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations to date 
year the year problem arises from the fact that due to early limitations on memory and disk storage many computer programs indicate the year by only two digits  rather than four 
this limitation can cause programs both system and application that perform arithmetic operations  comparisons  or sorting of data fields to yield incorrect results when working outside the year range of through the company has anticipated potential year issues and has substantially completed all in house preparation for the upcoming event 
the company is still in the process of accessing vendors and customer s capabilities in dealing with year issues 
the company owns nine switches which were manufactured by siemens telecom network siemens

siemens represents these patches to be provided free of charge  and will be installed in fiscal year the info directions costguard billing system to be implemented by the company currently is represented as year compliant 
the company intends to poll vendors and customers about year issues 
this process should be completed by the end of fiscal year the cost for polling will be immaterial 
the company s major vendors at t  sprint and mci worldcom are fortune companies which have disclosure requirements for year issues 
the risk of these vendors not minimizing their risk should be minimal 
the company has two major concerns with year issues as it applies to customers 
first  the customer phone equipment should be year compliant 
if it is not  the customers will not be able to utilize all of the capabilities of the phone systems  thus possibly reducing the revenues of the company 
the info directions costguard billing system will allow the company to provide billing information to customers in electronic data formats 
if the customer s computer systems are not year compliant  they will not be able to utilize this service 
cautionary statements in addition to the other information in this annual report on form k  the following factors should be considered carefully when evaluating the likelihood of the company s realization of expectations with respect to operating results and other matters described in this annual report on form k 
see special note regarding forward looking statements on page additional necessary capital equalnet and wholesale filed for chapter protection in september of the company may need additional capital to obtain the creditor s approval of a plan of reorganization for equalnet 
in addition  it is likely that additional capital may be needed to fund operating deficits of the company s other subsidiaries during the foreseeable future 
although the company has no current funding sources  it believes it can attract additional funding if it is able to reduce the liabilities of equalnet through the plan of reorganization 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to obtain the necessary capital or sufficiently reduce equalnet s liabilities to continue to operate the company 
attrition rates in the event that the company experiences attrition rates in excess of those anticipated either as a result of increased provisioning times by its underlying carrier  the purchase of poorly performing traffic  or the inability to properly manage the existing customer base  additional charges that affect earnings may be incurred 
dependence on independent marketing agents usc telecom has a small internal sales force and obtains the majority of its new customers from independent marketing agents agents 
usc telecom s near term ability to expand its business depends upon whether it can continue to maintain favorable relationships with existing agents and recruit and establish new relationships with additional agents 
no assurances can be made as to the willingness of the existing agents to continue to provide new orders to usc telecom or as to usc telecom s ability to attract and establish relationships with new agents 
dependence on at t and other facilities based carriers the company  even though it now owns nine switches  depends upon other carriers to provide the telecommunications services that it resells to its customers and the detailed information upon which it bases its customer billings 
the company s near term ability to expand its business partially depends upon whether it can continue to maintain relationships with at t and sprint 
the loss of the telecommunications services that the company receives from at t or sprint could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
carrier commitments equalnet has significant commitments with certain carriers to resell long distance services 
equalnet s contracts with its carriers contain clauses that could materially and adversely impact equalnet should equalnet incur a shortfall in meeting its commitments 
although equalnet has from time to time failed to meet its commitment levels under a particular contract and in each case has been able to negotiate a settlement with the carrier which resulted in no penalty being incurred by equalnet  there can be no assurances that equalnet will be able to reach similar favorable settlements with its carriers in the event that equalnet should fail to meet its future commitments 
to the extent that these carriers are considered to be utilities in equalnet s bankruptcy proceeding  these carriers will be entitled to adequate assurance of payment for carrier services after september   the bankruptcy filing date 
adequate assurance may be in the form of cash deposits or advance payments in an amount determined by the court as sufficient to provide these carriers with adequate assurance of payment 
the failure to provide adequate assurance of payment for future services would give these carriers the right to discontinue to provide such services 
current sources of funds from operations and working capital may not be sufficient to provide the amount of adequate assurance of payment required by these carriers 
there can be no assurance that equalnet would be able to secure funding for the amount of any adequate assurance that may be required of equalnet 
see note chapter and filing and note liquidity and working capital deficit 
in recent years  at t  mci worldcom and sprint have consistently followed one another in pricing their long distance products 
if mci worldcom and sprint were to lower their rates for long distance service and at t did not adopt a similar price reduction  adverse customer reaction could affect the company s ability to meet its commitments under the at t contract which could have a material adverse affect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
to the extent that these carriers are considered to be utilities in equalnet s bankruptcy proceedings  these carriers will be entitled to adequate assurance of payment for carrier services after september   the petition date 
adequate assurance may be in the form of cash deposits or advance payments in an amount determined by the court as sufficient to provide these carriers with adequate assurance of payment 
billing system problems equalnet converted to a new customer management  billing and rating system ams  purchased from platinum communications in march unlike netbase the system used for most of fiscal year prior to conversion  ams has capabilities required for switch based data gathering  rating and billing 
the conversion coincided with the acquisition of a new customer base sa telecom and a migration to a switch based environment  considerable billing errors and delays occurred 
additionally  there are aspects of ams that could require continuing support from platinum communications 
this reliance upon an outside source for billing system troubleshooting has slowed the conversion recovery process 
as of september   equalnet is making plans to convert to costguard enterprise  an industrial class rating  billing and customer care system built on a microsoft sql server database platform 
this system is being purchased from info directions  inc  idi and is expected to dramatically improve rating speed and billing accuracy 
also  equalnet expects to be able to more readily extract meaningful data and management reports from costguard 
the system design is flexible enough to respond to rapid changes in the telecommunications marketplace 
in fiscal year  equalnet recorded a write off of  for netbase and estimated the useful file of ams to be approximately one year until the costguard system can be implemented 
the new system  costguard  will cost  initially  then  per year in subsequent years for ongoing support and software upgrades 
there can be no assurance that the idi billing system will fully meet equalnet s current and on going needs 
if the idi system fails to provide the expected results  equalnet may need to invest in other alternative billing systems 
relationships with state regulatory agencies equalnet s and usc telecom s intrastate long distance telecommunications operations are subject to various state laws and regulations  including prior certification  notification or registration requirements 
equalnet and usc telecom must generally obtain and maintain certificates of public convenience and necessity from regulatory authorities in most states in which it offers service 
any failure to maintain proper certification in jurisdictions in which either of these companies provide a significant amount of intrastate long distance service could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
volatility of securities prices historically  the market price of the common stock has been highly volatile 
during all of fiscal  the market price for the common stock as reported by the nasdaq has ranged from a high of per share to a low of per share 
there can be no assurance that the market price of the common stock will remain at any level for any period of time or that it will increase or decrease to any level 
changes in the market price of the common stock may bear no relation to equalnet s actual operational or financial results 
in addition  if the company fails to maintain the minimum bid price per share or the minimum net tangible assets million requirements of nasdaq  the common stock would be subject to delisting by nasdaq 
on september   nasdaq notified the company that it would be delisted if the closing bid price for its common stock is not equal to or greater than for a minimum of ten consecutive trading days during the period from october  to december  on october   nasdaq also notified the company that it would be delisted if the market value of its public float was not equal to or greater than million for a minimum of ten consecutive trading days during the period from october  to january  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates on its borrowing and receivable sales facilities 
these instruments carry interest at a pre agreed upon percentage point spread over the prime interest rate 
at june   the company had million outstanding under its debt facilities 
based on this balance  an immediate change of one percent in the interest rate would cause a change in interest expense of approximately  on an annual basis 
the company s objective in maintaining these variable rate borrowings is the flexibility obtained regarding lower overall cost as compared with fixed rate borrowings
