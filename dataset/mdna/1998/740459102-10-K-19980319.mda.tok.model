the company is currently assessing the impact of this statement on the information it discloses 
year the company is preparing for the ramifications that the year issue could have on its computer systems and applications 
the year problem is being confronted by companies worldwide 
it is the result of computer programs being written using two digits to define the applicable year rather than three or four digits 
any programs that have time sensitive software may interpret a date designated as as the year rather than the year this could result in miscalculations  disruptions of operations or a major system failure 
the problem can affect a wide range of automated information systems  such as mainframe applications  personal computers and communication systems 
the company has determined it will need to modify or replace certain existing software or convert to new software in order to achieve year compliance 
the company presently believes that  as a result of such actions  the year problem will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
if such modifications and conversions are not made  however  or are not completed in a timely fashion  the year problem could have a material impact on the company s operation 
as part of its compliance efforts  the company has begun to initiate formal communications with significant suppliers and customers to determine the extent to which the company s systems and operations are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their year problems 
there can be no guarantee  however  that the systems of these other companies will be converted in a timely fashion and would not have an adverse effect on the company 
the company is using both internal and external resources to identify and test the systems for year compliance  and to reprogram or replace them where necessary 
it is presently anticipated that such efforts will be completed by mid the company expects to spend approximately million in and to modify its systems 
these costs will be expensed as incurred 
the amount expensed in was immaterial 
the costs of the compliance effort and the date by which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based upon management s best estimates 
there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  however  and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
impact of inflation inflation as measured by the consumer price index has continued at a low level in the united states 
the company did not experience any significant cost increases during or
