in addition  selected elements of the nci technology require the company to pay additional per unit royalties in the event the company s future sales of products that include the modified nci technology exceed specified volume levels 
the licensed source code will be ported by the company to its vxworks  ixworks  wisp and other real time embedded operating systems and will become a component of future products 
at the date the source code was acquired  there were no working models of such products incorporating the licensed technology and because of the restrictive nature of the license agreement  there were no alternative future uses for such technology in research and development

the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the purchase price has been allocated to the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed based upon the fair values at the date of acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of the net tangible assets acquired aggregated approximately million  of which million was allocated to in process research and development and expensed immediately 
the company used the discounted cash flow dcf approach to determine the fair value of ost and its identifiable assets  including the value of the products in the development stage which were not considered to have reached technological feasibility 
the dcf approach includes an analysis of the markets  completion costs  cash flows  other required assets  contributions made by core technology  and risks associated with achieving such cash flows

provision for taxes the company s effective consolidated tax rates amounted to  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the effective consolidated tax rate increased in fiscal due to a portion of the write off of certain acquired in process research and development being non deductible 
the overall changes in the effective tax rates result primarily from the difference between foreign and domestic tax rates and the ratio of foreign taxable income to domestic taxable income  varying levels of available research and development credits  and varying levels of tax exempt interest income

the company s investing activities used net cash of million 
during fiscal year  the company acquired certain technologies and companies for million 
other investing activities included capital expenditures  capitalization of software development costs and purchases of investments 
these were partially offset by sales of investments 
the company s financing activities provided net cash of million primarily as a result of the issuance of convertible subordinated notes and the issuance of common stock for stock option exercises 
the increase in financing activities was partially offset by treasury stock repurchases pursuant to the company s ongoing repurchase program 
under the current program  the company repurchases million of its common stock per quarter on the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market 
the current program is expected to continue for one year from the quarter ended january  during fiscal  the company repurchased  shares of common stock at a cost of million 
in july  the company issued million of convertible subordinated notes the notes  due the notes are subordinated to all existing and future senior debt and are convertible into shares of the company s common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the notes are redeemable at the option of the company  in whole or in part  at any time on or after august  at of the principal amount initially  and thereafter at prices declining to at maturity  in each case plus accrued interest 
each holder of these notes has the right  subject to certain conditions and restrictions  to require the company to offer to repurchase all outstanding notes  in whole or in part  owned by such holder  at specified repurchase prices plus accrued interest upon the occurrence of certain events 
the million of costs incurred in connection with the offering are included in prepaid and other assets 
these unamortized costs are being amortized to interest expense over the year term of the notes using the straight line method  which approximates the effective interest method 
interest on the notes began accruing july  and is payable semi annually on february and august  commencing february  in fiscal  the company purchased real property in the city of alameda  california for million cash 
the property is being developed to construct the company s new headquarters facility 
in fiscal  the company entered into an operating lease agreement for its new headquarters facility being constructed on the land the company purchased in alameda  california 
as of january   the lessor has funded a total of million of construction costs and has committed to fund up to a maximum of million 
the operating lease payments will begin upon completion of construction and will vary based on the total construction costs of the property  including capitalized interest and the london interbank offering rate libor 
construction of the building is currently expected to be completed in december in connection with the lease  the company is obligated to enter into a lease of its land in alameda  california to the lessor of the building at a nominal rate and for a term of years 
if the company terminates or does not negotiate an extension of the building lease  the ground lease converts to a market rental rate 
the lease provides the company with the option at the end of the lease of either acquiring the building at the lessor s original cost or arranging for the building to be acquired 
the company has guaranteed the residual value associated with the building to the lessor of approximately of the lessor s million funding obligation 
the company is also required  periodically during the construction period  to deposit fixed income securities with a custodian as a deposit to secure the performance of its obligations under the lease 
in addition  under the terms of the lease  the company must maintain compliance with certain financial covenants 
as of january   the company was in compliance with these covenants 
management believes that the contingent liability relating to the residual value guarantees will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
on march   the company entered into an accreting interest rate swap agreement the agreement to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on its floating rate operating lease for its new corporate headquarters see note to the consolidated financial statements 
this agreement effectively changes the company s interest rate exposure on its operating lease which is at one month libor to a fixed rate of 
the notional amount under the agreement is scheduled to increase in relation to the funds used to construct the company s new headquarters 
the differential to be paid or received under this agreement will be recognized as an adjustment to rent expense related to the operating lease 
the agreement matures at the same time as the operating lease expires 
the amounts potentially subject to credit risk arising from the possible inability of counterparty to meet the term of their contracts are generally limited to the amounts  if any  by which the counterparty s obligations exceed the obligations of the company 
management believes that the company s working capital and cash flow generated from operations are sufficient to meet its working capital requirements for planned expansion  product development and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
year issues the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the year approaches 
the year problem is pervasive and complex  as many computer systems will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
the year issue creates risk for the company from unforeseen problems in its own computer systems and from third parties with whom the company deals on transactions worldwide 
failures of the company s and or third parties computer systems could have a material impact on the company s ability to conduct its business 
the company is currently upgrading its financial information systems 
the company believes it will complete the upgrade during fiscal these upgraded financial information systems are believed to be year compliant 
the company is analyzing its remaining computer systems to identify any potential year issues and will take appropriate corrective action based on the results of such analysis 
management does not believe the costs related to achieving year compliance will be material 
the company has initiated communications with its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the company s operations are vulnerable to those third parties failure to solve their own year issues 
specific factors that might cause suppliers to be vulnerable to year issues include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and corrupt all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which the company relies will be converted on a timely basis and will not have an adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the year issue also could affect the products that the company sells 
the company believes that the current versions of its products are year compliant 
the company s products are subject to ongoing analysis and review
