net sales net sales for fiscal were million  an increase of from million in fiscal revenues from divested businesses in fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal net sales from the core businesses in fiscal were approximately million compared to million in fiscal excluding revenues from divested businesses  net sales in fiscal increased by million from fiscal largely due to increased sales in the mass storage products division  primarily related to increased unit sales of read channel devices and controllers  and million of revenues from patent cross license agreements which were offset by decreased sales in the pc products division  primarily related to decreasing unit sales and declining average selling prices of graphics products 
net sales for fiscal decreased from  million for fiscal sales of graphics  audio  and mass storage products decreased in fiscal over fiscal while sales of fax modem products increased 
the decline in net sales of graphics and audio products in fiscal was the result of decreasing unit sales and declining average selling prices 
the decline in net sales of mass storage products was the result of reduced sales of controller products offset somewhat by an increase in sales of read channel products 
the increase in net sales of fax modem products was primarily the result of increased sales of newer high speed modem products 
export sales  principally to asia  include sales to us based customers with manufacturing plants overseas and were approximately million in fiscal compared to approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal export sales to the pacific rim excluding japan were  and of net sales  to japan were  and of net sales  and to europe and the rest of the world were  and of net sales  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company s sales are currently denominated primarily in us dollars 
the company currently enters into foreign currency forward exchange and option contracts to hedge certain of its foreign currency exposures related to sales and balance sheet accounts denominated in yen 
the company has not experienced any significant losses related to its foreign exchange activity 
in fiscal  net sales to two customers were approximately and  respectively 
sales to one other customer in fiscal were approximately of net sales 
in fiscal  no single customer accounted for or more of net sales 
gross margin the gross margin percentage was in fiscal  compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
the gross margin increase in fiscal was primarily a result of improved margins in mass storage due to a change in mix within the mass storage products division towards read channel products  an overall change in product mix within the company towards mass storage products and million of patent cross license revenues in the fourth quarter which had no corresponding cost of sales 
these improvements were offset by lower margins in pc products and million of charges recorded in the fourth quarter related to wafer purchase commitments for micrus and cirent  the company s joint ventures 
the lower margins in pc products are primarily related to declining average selling prices on graphics and modem products 
excluding the impact of the patent cross license revenues and the wafer purchase commitment charges for both fiscal and fiscal  gross margins would have been for both fiscal years 
during fiscal  the gross margin was adversely impacted by million of charges that were recorded in the fourth quarter related to wafer purchase commitments of million and inventory write downs of million 
in fiscal  the gross margin was adversely impacted by million of fourth quarter charges for inventory write downs  wafer purchase commitments and manufacturing variances 
exclusive of these charges  the gross margin percentage would have been in fiscal and fiscal while the gross margins in these years were flat  they reflect reduced unit costs resulting from the migration to larger wafers and more efficient processing technologies  improved efficiencies at the company s micrus facility  and a decrease in the cost of wafers and assembly services purchased from third party suppliers  all of which were offset by the impact of decreased average selling prices for most of the company s major products 
research and development expenses research and development expenses expressed as a percentage of net sales were   and in fiscal  and  respectively 
research and development expenditures decreased in fiscal both as a percentage of net sales and absolute dollars primarily as a result of the divestiture of certain non core businesses and also as a result of the april headcount reductions which were made in connection with the company s realignment into four market focused divisions 
the absolute research and development spending decreased in fiscal over fiscal primarily due to divestitures 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of net sales represented approximately  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decreases as a percentage of net sales and in absolute dollars were primarily a result of the divestiture of certain non core businesses in fiscal and to the april headcount reductions which were made in connection with the company s realignment into four market focused divisions 
both the percentage of net sales and the absolute spending decreased in fiscal over fiscal were primarily a result of reductions in compensation expenses  marketing expenses for promotions and advertising  and administrative expenses  including the impact of divestitures 
gain on sale of assets during the third quarter of fiscal  the company sold its nuera communications  inc subsidiary for cash proceeds of approximately million million net of million of nuera s own cash and recorded a gain of approximately million 
gain on sale of assets also includes the reversal of million that had previously been accrued for losses on facilities commitments in connection with the sale and shut down of the operating divisions of pacific communication sciences  inc pcsi in the fourth quarter of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company completed the sale of the assets of pcsi s wireless semiconductor products to rockwell international for million in cash and made the decision to shut down pcsi s subscriber product group 
in connection with the sale of the pcsi wireless semiconductor product group and the shut down of the subscriber group  the company recorded a net gain of million 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company completed the sale to adc telecommunications inc of the pcsi infrastructure product group 
the company received approximately million in cash for the group 
in connection with the transaction  the company recorded a gain of approximately million 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company completed the sale of its picopower product line to national semiconductor corporation 
the company received approximately million in cash for the picopower product line 
in connection with the transaction  the company recorded a gain of approximately million 
restructuring costs and other  net the company recorded restructuring costs of million in the third quarter of fiscal in connection with a discontinuation of certain strategies and product development efforts in the graphics product group of its pc products division 
this resulted in a workforce reduction of approximately positions 
the primary components of the restructuring charge were million related to excess assets and facility leases and million of severance payments that were made during fiscal the total expected cash outlay related to this charge is approximately million  of which million is expected to be paid in fiscal restructuring costs and other also includes a million reversal of amounts that had been previously accrued for losses on facilities in connection with the april restructuring and other costs of million representing additional compensation costs in connection with the same restructuring that were earned and recorded in the third quarter of fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as a result of the company s strategy to focus on the markets for multimedia graphics  video  and audio  mass storage  and communications  the company began divesting its non core business units and eliminating projects that do not fit within its core markets 
these actions resulted in a restructuring charge of million which included million related to workforce reductions and million primarily related to excess assets and facilities in connection with the reorganization into four market focused product divisions personal computer products  communications products  mass storage products  and crystal semiconductor products 
this resulted in a workforce reduction of approximately people in april  representing approximately percent of its worldwide staff 
as of march   activities related to this restructuring were substantially complete 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as a result of decreased demand for the company s products for use in personal computers  which accounted for more than of the company s revenue  management reviewed the various operating areas of the business and took certain steps to bring operating expenses and capacity in line with demand 
these actions resulted in a pre tax restructuring charge of approximately million 
the principal actions in the restructuring involved the consolidation of support infrastructure and the withdrawal from an unprofitable product line and reduction of planned production capacity 
this resulted in the elimination of approximately positions from the manufacturing  research and development  sales and marketing  and administrative departments 
as of march   activities related to this restructuring were substantially complete 
non recurring and merger costs in the third quarter of fiscal  the company incurred non recurring costs of approximately million associated with the formation of the cirent semiconductor joint venture with lucent technologies formerly at t microelectronics 
interest expense interest expense was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense in fiscal is primarily due to the company s convertible subordinated notes being outstanding for the entire fiscal year as compared with fiscal  in which the convertible subordinated notes were issued in the third quarter 
the increase in interest expense in fiscal as compared with fiscal was primarily the result of the issuance of convertible subordinated notes in fiscal and increased borrowings on short term and long term debt during fiscal interest income interest income in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal interest income increased in fiscal over fiscal as the funds raised by the fiscal convertible subordinated notes offering were available to be invested in cash equivalents and marketable securities for the entire year 
in addition  the company generated cash from operations during the year  which was also available for investment during the year 
interest income increased in fiscal over fiscal because the funds raised by the fiscal convertible subordinated notes offering were available to be invested in cash equivalents and marketable securities for part of the year 
other income expense  net in fiscal  other income expense  net  includes gains on the disposal of certain equity investments and foreign currency transaction gains  which were partially offset by certain legal settlements 
in fiscal  other income expense  net  primarily relates to foreign currency transaction gains 
income taxes the provision for income taxes was in fiscal compared to a benefit for income taxes of in fiscal and in fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal is equal to the us federal statutory rate  after the addition of state income taxes offset by federal and state research tax credits 
the tax benefit rates in and were less than the federal statutory rate  primarily because of foreign operating results which are taxed at rates other than the us statutory rate 
realization of the company s net deferred tax assets is dependent on future us taxable income 
while the company believes that it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized  other factors  including those mentioned in the discussion of future operating results  may impact the ultimate realization of such assets 
the deferred tax assets realizability is evaluated on a quarterly basis 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  the company generated million of cash and cash equivalents from its operating activities as compared to million during fiscal and million in fiscal the fiscal increase from fiscal was primarily due to improved accounts receivable and inventory turnover  funding received for equipment and leasehold advances to the joint ventures and the generation of income from operations as opposed to a net loss in the prior year 
included in the net income from operations in fiscal was million of patent cross license revenues 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in accounts payable 
the fiscal decrease from fiscal was primarily caused by the increase in the net loss from operations  the non cash effect of the gain on sale of assets offset partially by the increase in the non cash effect of depreciation and amortization and the net change in operating assets and liabilities 
the company generated million in cash in investing activities during fiscal  as opposed to using million during fiscal and million during fiscal part of the fiscal increase in cash was due to a higher percentage of the company s investments in securities with original maturities less than ninety days than in the prior fiscal year 
as a result  available for sale investments generated a net cash flow of million during fiscal year while using a net cash flow of million through purchase of investments in fiscal in addition  during fiscal the company received approximately million from the termination of the umc agreements  and approximately million from the sale of nuera proceeds of million less nuera s own cash of million as opposed to million of proceeds from the sale of assets in the prior year  which included proceeds from pcsi divestiture activities 
the decrease in cash from investing activities during fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily the result of a decrease in proceeds from short term investments and increased short term investment purchases in fiscal over fiscal along with a decrease in additions to property and equipment and the proceeds from sale of assets 
net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  as opposed to generating million and million of cash in fiscal and  respectively 
the cash used in fiscal was primarily due to payments on the company s outstanding lease obligations and debt 
the increase in cash from financing activities in fiscal was primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes offset by repayment of short term bank debt 
the semiconductor industry is extremely capital intensive 
to remain competitive  the company believes it must continue to invest in advanced wafer manufacturing and test equipment 
investments will continue to be made in the various external manufacturing arrangements and the company s facilities 
the company intends to obtain most of the necessary capital through direct or guaranteed equipment lease financing and the balance through debt and or equity financing  and cash generated from operations 
as of march   the company is contingently liable as guarantor or co guarantor for equipment leases of micrus and cirent which have remaining payments of approximately million due through compared to million as of march  in addition  the company has other commitments related to its joint venture relationships that total approximately million at march  as of march   the company has a bank line of credit to provide a commitment for letters of credit up to a maximum aggregate of million  which expires on june  and are collateralized by cash or securities with interest at the higher of a 
per annum above the latest federal funds rate as defined in the second amended credit agreement  or b the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by the bank 
the company is currently in compliance with all covenants under the bank line of credit 
the company expects to amend or replace the existing line of credit facility in fiscal the company does not believe the amendment of its line of credit will have an impact on its financial position or on its ability to finance its operations for the foreseeable future 
as of march   the company had approximately million outstanding letters of credit and an additional million available under this line of credit 
the company believes that its capital resources are adequate to meet its needs for at least the next months 
however  if additional financing is needed for any reason  there can be no assurance that financing will be available or  if available  will be on satisfactory terms 
failure to obtain adequate financing would restrict the company s ability to expand its manufacturing infrastructure  to make other investments in capital equipment  and to pursue other initiatives 
future operating results quarterly fluctuations the company s quarterly revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary substantially from quarter to quarter in the future 
the company s operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors  many of which are outside of the company s control  including but not limited to  economic conditions and overall market demand in the united states and worldwide  the company s ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis  the ability to retain and attract key technical and management personnel  changes in product mix  fluctuations in manufacturing costs which affect the company s gross margins  declines in market demand for the company s and its customers products  sales timing  the level of orders that are received and can be shipped in a quarter  the cyclical nature of both the semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by the company s products  product obsolescence  price erosion  and competitive factors 
the company s operating results in are likely to be affected by these factors as well as others 
the company must order wafers and build inventory well in advance of product shipments 
because the company s markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes  there is a risk that the company will forecast inaccurately and produce excess or insufficient inventories of particular products 
this inventory risk is heightened because many of the company s customers place orders with short lead times 
such inventory imbalances have occurred in the past and in fact contributed significantly to the company s operating losses in fiscal and these factors increase not only the inventory risk but also the difficulty of forecasting quarterly operating results 
moreover  as is common in the semiconductor industry  the company frequently ships more product in the third month of each quarter than in either of the first two months of the quarter  and shipments in the third month are higher at the end of that month 
the concentration of sales in the last month of the quarter contributes to difficulty in predicting the company s quarterly revenues and results of operations 
the company s success is highly dependent upon its ability to develop complex new products  to introduce them to the marketplace ahead of the competition  and to have them selected for design into products of leading system manufacturers 
both revenues and margins may be affected quickly if new product introductions are delayed or if the company s products are not designed into successive generations of products of the company s customers 
these factors have become increasingly important to the company s results of operations because the rate of change in the markets served by the company continues to accelerate 
issues relating to manufacturing and manufacturing investment the company participates in joint ventures with international business machines corp 
ibm  micrus joint venture  and lucent technologies  cirent semiconductor joint venture  under a series of agreements intended to secure a committed supply of wafers from manufacturing facilities operated by the joint ventures 
the joint ventures are controlled by ibm and lucent technologies  respectively  and are dependent on the controlling partners advanced proprietary manufacturing process technologies and manufacturing expertise 
these agreements include wafer purchase agreements under which the company is committed to purchase a fixed percentage of the output of the joint venture manufacturing facilities 
as a result  the operating results of the company may be more sensitive to changing business conditions  as anticipated decreases in revenues could cause the company to decide to not fulfill its wafer purchase obligations 
this would result in charges to the company from the joint ventures in amounts intended to cover the joint ventures fixed costs related to the shortfall in wafer orders from the company 
the company determines any estimated shortfalls in such purchase commitments over the short term six months and accrues such amounts to the extent they would result in inventory losses were the company to fulfill the commitment and take delivery of the related inventory 
the company s gross margins and earnings were adversely impacted by such charges in the amounts of million  million  million  million and million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the fourth and second quarters of fiscal and the second and first quarter of fiscal  respectively 
with its other foundries  the company becomes committed upon placing orders and is subject to penalties for cancellations 
moreover  the company will benefit from the micrus and cirent semiconductor joint ventures only if they are able to produce wafers at or below prices generally prevalent in the market 
if  however  either of these ventures is not able to produce wafers at competitive prices  the company s results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the process of beginning production and increasing volume with the joint ventures inevitably involves risks  and there can be no assurance that the manufacturing costs of such ventures will be competitive 
during fiscal and  excess production capacity in the industry lead to significant price competition between merchant semiconductor foundries and the company believes that in some cases this resulted in pricing from certain foundries that was lower than the company s cost of production from its manufacturing joint ventures 
the company experienced pressures on its selling prices during fiscal and fiscal  which had a negative impact on its results of operations and it believes that this was partially due to the fact that certain of its competitors were able to obtain favorable pricing from such foundries 
certain provisions of the micrus and cirent semiconductor agreements may cause the termination of the joint venture in the event of a change in control of the company 
such provisions could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of the company 
in connection with the financing of its operations  the company has borrowed money and entered into substantial equipment lease obligations and is likely to expand such commitments in the future 
such indebtedness could cause the company s principal and interest obligations to increase substantially 
the degree to which the company is leveraged could adversely affect the company s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  acquisitions or other purposes and could make it more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures 
the company s ability to meet its debt service and other obligations will be dependent upon the company s future performance  which will be subject to financial  business  and other factors affecting the operations of the company  many of which are beyond its control 
an inability to obtain financing to meet these obligations could cause the company to become in default of such obligations 
although the company has increased its future wafer supplies from micrus and cirent semiconductor  the company expects to continue to purchase portions of its wafers from  and to be reliant upon  outside merchant wafer suppliers 
the company s current strategy is to fulfill its wafer requirements using a balance of secured wafer supply from its joint ventures and from outside merchant wafer suppliers 
the company also uses other outside vendors to package the wafer die into integrated circuits and to perform the majority of the company s product testing 
during the second quarter of fiscal the company reduced its purchase obligations at cirent semiconductor by percent  pursuant to an agreement under which the company can reacquire  at no incremental cost  an additional percent of the total cirent semiconductor wafer output and can sell any portion of its wafer purchase obligation to third parties on a foundry basis 
the agreement also provides the company with future access to certain lucent advanced process technologies including micron process technology 
the company s results of operations could be adversely affected in the future  as they have been so affected in the past  if particular suppliers are unable to provide a sufficient and timely supply of product  whether because of raw material shortages  capacity constraints  unexpected disruptions at the plants  delays in qualifying new suppliers or other reasons  or if the company is forced to purchase wafers or packaging from higher cost suppliers or to pay expediting charges to obtain additional supply  or if the company s test facilities are disrupted for an extended period of time 
because of the concentration of sales at the end of each quarter  a disruption in the company s production or shipping near the end of a quarter could materially reduce the company s revenues for that quarter 
production may be constrained even though capacity is available at one or more wafer manufacturing facilities because of the difficulty of moving production from one facility to another 
any supply shortage could adversely affect sales and operating profits 
the company s reliance upon outside vendors for assembly and test could also adversely impact sales and operating profits if the company was unable to secure sufficient access to the services of these outside vendors 
product development in the company s markets is becoming more focused on the integration of functionality on individual devices and there is a general trend towards increasingly complex products 
the greater integration of functions and complexity of operations of the company s products increase the risk that latent defects or subtle faults could be discovered by customers or end users after volumes of product have been shipped 
if such defects were significant  the company could incur material recall and replacement costs for product warranty 
the company s relationship with customers could also be adversely impacted by the recurrence of significant defects 
dependence on pc market although the company s future direction is to emphasize non pc market opportunities in mass storage  communications  consumer electronics and industrial automation  sales of many of the company s products will continue to depend largely on sales of personal computers pcs 
reduced growth in the pc market could affect the financial health of the company as well as its customers 
moreover  as a component supplier to pc oems and to peripheral device manufacturers  the company is likely to experience a greater magnitude of fluctuations in demand than the company s customers themselves experience 
in addition  many of the company s products are used in pcs for the consumer market  and the consumer pc market is more volatile than other segments of the pc market 
other integrated circuit ic makers  including intel corporation  have expressed their interest in integrating through hardware functions  adding through special software functions  or kitting components to provide some multimedia or communications features into or with their microprocessor products 
successful integration of these functions could substantially reduce the company s opportunities for ic sales in these areas 
in addition  the company s de emphasis of pc products and its focus on non pc markets could have an adverse affect on the company s pc product sales as customers seek other supply sources with greater commitments to the pc market 
a number of pc oems buy products directly from the company and also buy motherboards  add in boards or modules from suppliers who in turn buy products from the company 
accordingly  a significant portion of the company s sales may depend directly or indirectly on the sales to a particular pc oem 
since the company cannot track sales by motherboard  add in board or module manufacturer  the company may not be fully informed as to the extent or even the fact of its indirect dependence on any particular pc oem  and  therefore  may be unable to assess the risks of such indirect dependence 
issues relating to mass storage market the disk drive market has historically been characterized by a relatively small number of disk drive manufacturers and by periods of rapid growth followed by periods of oversupply and contraction 
growth in the mass storage market is directly affected by growth in the pc market 
furthermore  the price competitive nature of the disk drive industry continues to put pressure on the price of all disk drive components 
recent market demands for sub  pc s puts further pressure on the price of disk drives and disk drive components 
in addition  consolidation in the disk drive industry has reduced the number of customers for the company s mass storage products and increased the risk of large fluctuations in demand 
the company believes that constraints in supply of certain read head components to the disk drive industry limited sales of its mass storage products in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  the company believes that excess inventories held by its customers limited sales of the company s mass storage products in the second quarter of fiscal and limited sales of the company s optical disk drive products in the third quarter of fiscal revenues from mass storage products in fiscal are likely to depend heavily on the success of certain inch disk drive products selected for use by various customers  which in turn depends upon obtaining timely customer qualification of the new products and bringing the products into volume production timely and cost effectively 
the company s revenues from mass storage products are dependent on the successful introduction by its customers of new disk drive products and can be impacted by the timing of customers transition to new disk drive products 
recent efforts by certain of the company s customers to develop their own ics for mass storage products could in the future reduce demand for the company s mass storage products  which could have an adverse effect on the company s revenues and gross margins from such products 
in addition  in response to the current market trend towards integrating hard disk controllers with microcontrollers  the company s revenues and gross margins from its mass storage products will be dependent on the company s ability to introduce such integrated products in a commercially competitive manner 
during the last half of fiscal  major companies in the disk drive industry  including certain of the company s customers  have reported declines in business 
in addition  the company s mass storage products were not designed into a major customer s next generation product which is expected to run fiscal consequently  these factors will have an adverse impact on the mass storage division s revenue through at least the first half of fiscal issues relating to graphics products in november  the company changed its direction in graphics from reliance on d and d stand alone products to a strategy of providing future integrated multimedia products 
concurrently  the company realigned and reduced its graphics research and development and marketing activities toward this new product direction  resulting in a workforce reduction of approximately sixty five employees 
while the company continues to sell its line of existing d and d graphics products  levels and duration of future revenues from these products is uncertain 
further  if the new integrated function products are not brought to market in a timely manner or do not address the market needs or costs of performance requirements  then the company s market share and sales will be adversely affected 
issues relating to consumer electronics products most of the company s revenues in the consumer electronics arena are in the multimedia audio market derive from the sales of audio codecs and integrated bit codec plus controller solutions for the pc market and consumer electronics equipment 
in the pc market  pricing pressures have forced a transition from multi chip solutions to products that integrate the codec  controller and synthesis functions into a single ic 
the company s revenues from the sale of pc audio products in fiscal are likely to be significantly affected by the introduction of cost reduced  fully integrated  single chip audio ics 
moreover  aggressive competitive pricing pressures have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the company s revenues and gross margins from the sale of audio ics 
in addition  the introduction of new audio products from the company s competitors  the introduction of mediaprocessors and the introduction of mmx processors with multimedia features by intel corporation could adversely affect revenues and gross margins from the sale of the company s audio products 
three dimensional  spatial effects audio became an important feature in fiscal  primarily in products for the consumer electronics marketplace 
if the company s spatial effects audio products do not meet the cost or performance requirements of the market  revenues from the sale of audio products could be adversely affected 
issues relating to communications products the communications market for voice data fax modem chip sets is intensely competitive  and competitive pricing pressures have affected and are likely to continue to affect the average selling prices and gross margins of this product line 
as a relatively new entrant to this market  the company may be at a competitive disadvantage to suppliers who have long term customer relationships  have greater market share or have greater financial resources 
in addition  the introduction of new modem products from the company s competitors  the introduction of media processors and the introduction of mmx processors with multimedia features by intel corporation could adversely affect revenues and gross margins from the sale of the company s modem products 
issues relating to industrial products industrial products is a very broad market with many well established competitors 
the company s ability to compete in this market will be adversely affected if it cannot establish broad sales channels or if it does not develop and maintain a broad enough product line to compete effectively 
in addition  the customer product design in time is long 
customer delays in product development and introductions creates risk relative to the company s revenue plans 
further  the company s products in this market are technically very complex 
the complexity of the products contributes to risks in getting products to market on a timely basis  which could impact the company s revenue plans 
the scarcity of analog engineering talent also contributes to risks related to product development timing in this market 
intellectual property matters the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
the company and certain of its customers from time to time have been notified that they may be infringing certain patents and other intellectual property rights of others 
in addition  customers have been named in suits alleging infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights by customer products 
certain components of these products have been purchased from the company and may be subject to indemnification provisions made by the company to its customers 
although licenses are generally offered in situations where the company or its customers are named in suits alleging infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights  there can be no assurance that any licenses or other rights can be obtained on acceptable terms 
an unfavorable outcome occurring in any such suit could have an adverse effect on the company s future operations and or liquidity 
foreign operations and markets because many of the company s subcontractors and several of the company s key customers  such customers collectively accounting for a significant percentage of the company s revenues  are located in japan and other asian countries  the company s business is subject to risks associated with many factors beyond its control 
international operations and sales may be subject to political and economic risks  including political instability  currency controls  exchange rate fluctuations  and changes in import export regulations  tariff and freight rates 
although the company buys hedging instruments to reduce its exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations  the company s competitive position can be affected by the exchange rate of the us dollar against other currencies  particularly the japanese yen 
further  to the extent that volatility in foreign financial markets was to have an adverse impact on economic conditions in a country or geographic region in which the company does business  demand for and supply of the company s products could be adversely impacted  which would have a negative impact on the company s revenues and earnings 
a significant number of the company s customers and suppliers are in asia 
the recent turmoil in the asian financial markets does not appear to have had a material impact on the company s sales orders or bookings 
however  the financial instability in these regions may have an adverse impact on the financial position of end users in the region which could impact future orders and or the ability of such users to pay the company or the company s customers  which could also impact the ability of such customers to pay the company 
the company performs extensive financial due diligence on customers and potential customers and generally required material sales to asia to either be secured by letters of credit or transacted on a cash on demand basis 
given the current situation in asia  the company has begun to require the letters of credit to be established through american banking institutions 
during this volatile period  the company expects to carefully evaluate the collection risk related to the financial position of customers and potential customers 
the results of such evaluations will be considered in structuring the terms of sale  in determining whether to accept sales orders  in evaluating the recognition of revenue on sales in the area and in evaluating the collectability of outstanding accounts receivable from the region 
in situations where significant collection risk exists  the company will either not accept the sales order  defer the recognition of related revenues  or  in the case of previously transacted sales  establish appropriate bad debt reserves 
despite these precautions  should the current volatility in asia have a material adverse impact on the financial position on end users of the customers products in asia  the company could experience a material adverse impact on its results of operations 
competition the company s business is intensely competitive and is characterized by new product cycles  price erosion  and rapid technological change 
competition typically occurs at the design stage  where the customer evaluates alternative design approaches that require integrated circuits 
because of shortened product life cycles and even shorter design in cycles  the company s competitors have increasingly frequent opportunities to achieve design wins in next generation systems 
in the event that competitors succeed in supplanting the company s products  the company s market share may not be sustainable and net sales  gross margin  and results of operations would be adversely affected 
competitors include major domestic and international companies  many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources than the company with which to pursue engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products 
emerging companies are also increasing their participation in the market  as well as customers who develop their own integrated circuit products 
competitors include manufacturers of standard semiconductors  application specific integrated circuits and fully customized integrated circuits  including both chip and board level products 
the ability of the company to compete successfully in the rapidly evolving area of high performance integrated circuit technology depends significantly on factors both within and outside of its control  including  but not limited to  success in designing  manufacturing and marketing new products  wafer supply  protection of company products by effective utilization of intellectual property laws  product quality  reliability  ease of use  price  diversity of product line  efficiency of production  the pace at which customers incorporate the company s integrated circuits into their products  success of the customers products  and general economic conditions 
also the company s future success depends  in part  upon the continued service of its key engineering  marketing  sales  manufacturing  support  and executive personnel  and on its ability to continue to attract  retain  and motivate qualified personnel 
the competition for such employees is intense  and the loss of the services of one or more of these key personnel could adversely affect the company 
because of these and other factors  past results may not be a useful predictor of future results 
impact of year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
if the company s computer programs with date sensitive functions are not year compliant  they may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company is currently in the process of modifying and or replacing significant portions of its software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the company presently believes that with modifications to testing software and conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company will use both internal and external resources to reprogram or replace and test the software for year modifications
