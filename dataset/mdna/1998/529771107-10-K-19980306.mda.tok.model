item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview lexmark international group  inc together with its subsidiaries  the company or lexmark is a global developer  manufacturer and supplier of laser and inkjet printers and associated consumable supplies 
the company also sells dot matrix printers for printing single and multi part forms by business users 
the company s core printer business targets the office and home markets 
in addition to its core printer business  lexmark develops  manufactures and markets a broad line of other office imaging products which include supplies for international business machines corporation ibm branded printers  after market supplies for other original equipment manufacturer oem products  and typewriters and typewriter supplies that are sold under the ibm trademark 
the company s keyboard and other product category was phased out by the end of the first quarter of in the past few years  the worldwide printer industry has seen substantial growth in demand for laser and inkjet printers as a result of increasing penetration of personal computers into the office and home markets 
during this period  the company s own product mix has evolved  with its laser and inkjet printers and associated supplies representing an increasingly larger percentage of its sales volume and revenues  particularly as the increasing base of installed lexmark printers generates additional revenues from recurring sales of supplies for those printers primarily laser and inkjet cartridges 
in  revenues from the sale of printers and associated printer supplies increased from and accounted for of total company revenues of approximately billion 
most of this growth was derived from increasing sales of laser and inkjet printers and printer cartridge supplies  offset in part by slowing demand for dot matrix printers which depend on older impact printing technology and declines in the traditional ibm branded supplies business 
lexmark believes that its total revenues will continue to grow due to overall market growth and increases in the company s market share in both the network and color inkjet printer categories 
management believes that this growth will more than offset reduced demand for dot matrix impact printers which depend on older impact printing technology and declines in the traditional ibm branded supplies business 
in recent years  the company s growth rate in sales of printer units generally exceeded the growth rate of its printer revenues due to price pressures and the introduction of new lower priced products in both the laser and inkjet printer markets 
in the laser printer market  unit price pressure is partially offset by the tendency of customers to move up to higher priced printer models with faster speeds  greater network connectivity and other new features 
in the inkjet printer market  advances in color inkjet technology have resulted in lower prices for printers with sharper resolution and improved performance 
the greater affordability of color inkjet printers has been an important factor in the recent growth of this market 
the company s other office imaging products category includes many mature products such as supplies for ibm printers  typewriters and typewriter supplies and other impact supplies that require little investment but provide a significant source of cash flow 
the company expects that the market for these products and the profitability from the sale of these products will continue to decline  but the company will attempt to mitigate these declines through the introduction of new supplies for non impact technologies  such as after market laser cartridges 
lexmark introduced its first after market laser cartridges in may for the large installed base of a range of laser printers sold by other manufacturers 
the company s strategy for other office imaging products is to pursue the after market oem laser supplies opportunity while managing its mature businesses for cash flow 
the company expects that its overall margins will remain relatively stable as its associated printer supplies business becomes an increasingly larger part of its business  offsetting the decline in the company s other office imaging products supplies business 
although the company expects continuing declines in printer prices  it expects to reduce costs in line with price decreases 
the company s operations have been significantly impacted by a number of key agreements with ibm which were negotiated as part of the acquisition of information products corporation from ibm in march in general  these agreements expired on march  although the company and ibm have entered into a number of new agreements  which extend some of the original agreements although on less favorable terms and provide for an ongoing relationship in other areas  management expects that future revenue and profit attributable to sales to ibm will continue to decline 
in february  the public offering of  shares of the company s class a common stock by certain of its stockholders was completed at a public offering price of per share 
in november  the public offering of  shares of the company s class a common stock by certain of its stockholders was completed at a public offering price of per share 
the company and current members of management chose not to sell any shares in either offering and  therefore  did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares 
in november  the company repurchased an additional million shares the repurchase shares from certain of the stockholders participating in the november offering at a price of per share which was equal to the net proceeds per share received by the selling stockholders participating in the offering for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
see liquidity and capital resources 
in january  the company entered into a new million unsecured  revolving credit facility with a group of banks 
upon entering the new agreement  the company repaid the amounts outstanding on its existing term loan and revolving credit facility

revenues 
printers and associated supplies represen an increasingly larger proportion of company s operations in percent printers and associated supplies other the company s results were primarily driven by printers and associated supplies 
the company introduced the optra s family of monochrome and color laser printers in may  and also made inkjet product announcements in the second and third quarters of  with the introduction of the  and color jetprinters  along with the series of color jetprinters 
even though the product line was in transition  printer volumes grew at double digit rates and printer supplies revenues increased during as compared to due primarily to the continued growth of the company s installed printer base 
the color inkjet market  the fastest growing segment of the personal printer market printers in the pages per minute ppm category  expanded rapidly due to growth in personal computers and home offices  and the development of easy to use color inkjet technology with good quality color print capability at low prices 
lexmark introduced its first color inkjet printer using its own technology in and experienced strong sales growth through retail outlets 
the company increased its product distribution through retail outlets  with the number of such outlets worldwide rising from approximately  retail outlets in to more than  in  and remaining relatively constant during the company s ability to increase or maintain its presence in the retail marketplace with its branded products may be adversely affected as the company becomes more successful in its sales and marketing efforts for oem opportunities 
the company made substantial capital investments in its inkjet production capacity in and to address the growing demand for its color inkjet printers 
with its optra s laser printers  a majority of the company s laser printers are office desktop printers laser printers that print at speeds of ppm  which the company believes is one of the fastest growing segments of the laser printer market 
office desktop laser printer growth is being driven by the office migration from large mainframe computers to local area networks that link various types of computers using a variety of protocols and operating systems 
the company s installed base of printers supports a large and profitable printer supplies business 
because consumable supplies must be replaced on average one to three times a year  depending on type of printer and usage  demand for laser and inkjet print cartridges is increasing at a higher rate than printer shipments 
the company expects this recurring and relatively high margin business to contribute to the stability of the company s earnings over time 
consolidated gross profit was million for  an increase of from this was mainly driven by improved printer margins and a richer mix of supplies versus printer hardware 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues for increased to from in gross profit attributable to printers and associated supplies increased  principally due to reductions in product costs and growth in higher margin associated consumable supplies

the transition out of the keyboard business was completed in march and  excluding this business  revenues were up million or 
total us revenues increased million or  and excluding the keyboard business  were up 
international revenues were up million or 
the increase in consolidated revenues was principally due to growth in the core printer and associated supplies business 
hardware volumes have shown significant growth in the sales of inkjet printers while printer supplies revenues increased due to the continued growth of the company s installed printer base 
these revenue increases more than offset price reductions on certain printers 
foreign currency translation effects were slightly unfavorable for compared to revenues from other office imaging products increased primarily due to the growth of the after market laser cartridge business which more than offset the declines in the traditional ibm branded supplies business 
the company increased its product distribution through retail outlets  with the number of such outlets worldwide rising from approximately  retail outlets in to more than  in the company has made substantial capital investments in its inkjet production capacity in and to address the growing demand for its color inkjet products

gross profit as a percentage of revenues was in  slightly better than in gross profit attributable to printers and associated supplies increased  principally due to higher revenues and the mix of these revenues

liquidity and capital resources lexmark s primary source of liquidity has been cash generated by operations  which totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash from operations has been sufficient to allow the company to repay significant amounts of debt  fund the company s working capital needs and finance its capital expenditures during these periods along with the repurchase of million of its class a common stock during the increase in cash provided by operating activities for was principally due to stronger earnings before extraordinary loss  the increase in amounts outstanding under the trade accounts receivable programs  the increase of net deferred tax liabilities and favorable changes in working capital accounts 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities for primarily reflects higher working capital requirements in support of sales growth 
trade receivables were up principally due to higher revenues while accounts payable and accrued liabilities were down primarily due to the timing of payments 
the cash from operations was reduced by million due to lower trade receivables outstanding under the trade receivables financing programs than in cash from operations was favorably impacted by million due to effective management of inventory levels

cash from operations for was favorably impacted by million due to increased sales of trade receivables in an accounts receivable financing program and increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million  primarily due to the timing of payments 
cash flows from operations in may be less than in due primarily to higher working capital requirements in support of sales growth and higher capital expenditures to support continued new product introductions 
increased cash flow from earnings is expected to partially offset this decrease

in march  the company prepaid its million senior subordinated notes due in the prepayment resulted in an extraordinary charge of million million net of tax benefit caused by a prepayment premium and other fees 
senior notes in the principal amount of million were redeemed in march in march  the company entered into three year interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of million  whereby the company pays interest at a fixed rate of approximately and receives interest at a floating rate equal to the three month libor 
the swaps serve as a hedge of financings based on floating interest rates 
through its hedging programs  the company attempts to insulate a portion of its foreign denominated cash flows from the impact of exchange rate fluctuations 
the company utilizes interest rate currency swaps and has utilized interest rate caps to reduce its interest rate risks 
interest expense incurred in connection with these instruments amounted to million  million and million in  and  respectively 
at december   substantially all tangible and intangible assets of the company including shares of capital stock of the company s subsidiaries served as collateral for the term loan and revolving credit facility 
this credit agreement contained customary covenant restrictions with which the company was in compliance as of december  the new revolving credit facility that the company entered into in january  is an unsecured credit facility which also contains customary default provisions  leverage and interest coverage restrictions and certain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt  liens  mergers or consolidations and investments 
the company is party to an agreement to sell  on a limited recourse basis  up to million of its us trade receivables under a revolving arrangement 
proceeds from any such sales are available for general corporate purposes 
at december   trade receivables of million were outstanding under this program and  as collections reduce previously sold receivables  the company may replenish these with new receivables 
the agreement  which contains net worth and fixed charge coverage restrictions  must be renewed annually and is expected to be renewed upon its expiration in april this arrangement provides the company with lower cost funding than is currently available under its revolving credit facility 
the company is also a party to an agreement to sell up to million deutsche marks of germany trade receivables on a limited recourse basis 
at december   million deutsche marks of receivables approximately million at december  exchange rates were outstanding under this program and  as collections reduce previously sold receivables  the company may replenish these with new receivables

in february  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional million of its class a common stock 
this repurchase authority  like the prior authorizations  allows the company at management s discretion to selectively repurchase its stock from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions depending upon market price and other factors

the junior preferred stock was then retired 
capital expenditures capital expenditures totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the expenditures were mostly made in support of new products 
both and expenditures were higher due to expansion of the inkjet printer products manufacturing capacity  which included the conversion of a lexington facility and the establishment of facilities in mexico and scotland to manufacture inkjet cartridges 
looking forward to  the company expects capital expenditures to be between and million and to be funded primarily through cash from operations 
effect of currency exchange rates and exchange rate risk management revenues derived from international operations  including exports from the united states  make up over half of the company s consolidated revenues  with european revenues accounting for about of international revenues 
substantially all foreign subsidiaries maintain their accounting records in their local currencies 
consequently  period to period comparability of results of operations is affected by fluctuations in exchange rates 
while currency translation has significantly affected international revenues and cost of revenues  it did not have a material impact on operating income for the years the company attempts to reduce its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations through the use of operational hedges  such as pricing actions and product sourcing decisions

revenues by geographic area dollars in millions u 
s     europe other intl 
international revenues include exports from the us the company s exposure to exchange rate fluctuations generally cannot be minimized solely through the use of operational hedges 
therefore  the company utilizes financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts and currency options to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on firm and anticipated cash flow exposures and certain assets and liabilities which arise from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
the company does not purchase currency related financial instruments for purposes other than exchange rate risk management 
the company believes that international operations in new geographic markets will be less profitable than operations in us and european markets as a result  in part  of the higher investment levels for marketing  selling and distribution required to enter these markets 
although the current economic conditions in some of the asian geographies may adversely affect the company s growth in that region  management does not expect the impact will result in the company s not being able to achieve its operating income growth objective 
tax matters the company s effective tax rate for was  for was approximately  and for was 
the effective tax rate in was favorably impacted by research and development tax credits and the benefit of a foreign sales corporation 
as of december   the company had non us tax loss carryforwards of million  including million which expire between the years and portions of these non us tax loss carryforwards approximately million are not expected to provide a future benefit because they are attributable to income of certain non us entities that are also taxable in the non us inflation the company is subject to the effects of changing prices 
the company operates in an industry where product prices are very competitive and subject to downward price pressures 
as a result  future increases in production costs or raw material prices could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
however  the company actively manages its product costs and manufacturing processes in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of any such increases 
impact of the year issue the company has conducted a comprehensive review of its computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the year issue and has developed a comprehensive plan to resolve the issue 
the year issue is the result of computer programs that fail to utilize the full four digit representation of a year which would cause date sensitive software to recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculation causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company plans to complete the year issue project by december  due to the company s major information technology systems operating in a client server environment  the total cost associated with the required modifications and conversions is not expected to be material to the company s financial position or results of operations and is being expensed as incurred 
the company is communicating with its significant suppliers  customers and others with which it conducts business to help them identify and resolve their own year issue 
if necessary modifications and conversions by the company and those with which it conducts business are not completed timely  the year issue may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company expects to complete the year issue modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from expectations

factors that may affect future results and information concerning forward looking statements certain of the statements contained in this report may be considered forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  including  without limitation  i statements in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations concerning a the company s belief that its total revenues will continue to grow due to overall market growth and increases in the company s market share in both the network and color inkjet printer categories and that this growth will more than offset reduced demand in sales of certain of its products  b the company s expectation that printer prices will continue to decline and that it expects to reduce costs in line with price decreases  c the company s expectation that its overall margins will remain relatively stable as new product introductions contribute to growth in printer unit volumes and the associated printer supplies business becomes a larger part of the company s business  offsetting the decline in sales of certain of the company s other office imaging products  d the company s belief that office desktop printers are one of the fastest growing segments of the laser printer market  e the company s statement that higher working capital requirements are expected to be partially offset by earnings growth  f the company s expectations with respect to its capital expenditures  ii the statements in item business market overview and strategy printers and associated supplies market overview concerning the company s belief about growth in the printer hardware market  including double digit growth in volume of certain product categories such as office desktop laser printers and color inkjet printers  continued growth in the company s associated printer supplies business  and the after market laser cartridge market being a market with significant growth potential and environmental and regulatory matters concerning the company s belief that compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to it is not expected to have a material effect on its capital expenditures  earnings and competitive position  iii the statements in item legal proceedings concerning the company s belief with respect to the possible effect of certain legal proceedings  and current or future claims of intellectual property infringement on its financial position or results of operations  iv other statements as to management s expectations and belief presented in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  v other statements as to management s expectations and belief presented elsewhere in this report and vi variations in the foregoing statements whenever they appear in this report 
forward looking statements are made based upon management s current expectations and belief concerning future developments and their potential effects upon the company 
there can be no assurance that future developments affecting the company will be those anticipated by management 
there are a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or expectations reflected in such forward looking statements  including  without limitation  the factors set forth below the company s future operating results may be adversely affected if it is unable to continue to develop  manufacture and market products that meet customers needs 
the markets for printers and associated supplies are highly competitive  especially with respect to pricing and the introduction of new technologies and products offering improved features and functionality 
the company and its major competitors  all of which have significantly greater financial  marketing and technological resources than the company  have regularly lowered prices on their printers and are expected to continue to do so 
in particular  the inkjet printer market has experienced and is expected to continue to experience significant printer price pressure from the company s major competitors 
price reductions beyond expectations or the inability to reduce costs  contain expenses or increase sales as currently expected  as well as price protection measures  could result in lower profitability and jeopardize the company s ability to grow or maintain its market share 
the life cycles of the company s products  as well as delays in product development and manufacturing  variations in the cost of component parts  delays in customer purchases of existing products in anticipation of new product introductions by the company or its competitors and market acceptance of new products and programs  may cause a buildup in the company s inventories  make the transition from current products to new products difficult and could adversely affect the company s future operating results 
further  some of the company s newly developed products replace or compete with some of the company s existing products 
the competitive pressure to develop technology and products also could cause significant changes in the level of the company s operating expenses 
revenues derived from international sales  including exports from the united states  make up over half of the company s revenues 
accordingly  the company s future results could be adversely affected by a variety of factors  including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  trade protection measures  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
moreover  margins on international sales tend to be lower than those on domestic sales  and the company believes that international operations in new geographic markets will be less profitable than operations in the us and european markets as a result  in part  of the higher investment levels for marketing  selling and distribution required to enter these markets 
the company s success depends in part on its ability to obtain patents  copyrights and trademarks  maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
current or future claims of intellectual property infringement could prevent the company from obtaining technology of others and could otherwise adversely affect its operating results  cash flows  financial position or business  as could expenses incurred by the company in enforcing its intellectual property rights against others 
part of the company s business strategy is to expand its business through the acquisition of related businesses 
there can be no assurance that suitable acquisitions can be accomplished on terms favorable to the company 
further  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to operate profitably any businesses or other assets it may acquire  effectively integrate the operations of such acquisitions or otherwise achieve the intended benefits of such acquisitions 
factors unrelated to the company s operating performance  including economic and business conditions  both national and international  the loss of significant customers or suppliers  changes in and execution of the company s business strategy  and the ability to retain and attract key personnel  could also adversely affect the company s operating results 
in addition  trading activity in the company s common stock  particularly in light of the substantial number of shares owned by the original investor group that are available for resale  may affect the company s common stock price 
while the company reassesses material trends and uncertainties affecting the company s financial condition and results of operations in connection with its preparation of its quarterly and annual reports  the company does not intend to review or revise  in light of future events  any particular forward looking statement contained in this report 
the information referred to above should be considered by investors when reviewing any forward looking statements contained in this report  in any of the company s public filings or press releases or in any oral statements made by the company or any of its officers or other persons acting on its behalf 
the important factors that could affect forward looking statements are subject to change  and the company does not intend to update the foregoing list of certain important factors
