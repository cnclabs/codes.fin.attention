industry background the success of companies in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology  chemical and agrochemical industries is substantially dependent upon their ability to identify new pharmaceutical and chemical compounds with targeted activities and properties which can be brought to market rapidly and on a cost effective basis 
the discovery and development of a new pharmaceutical or chemical product candidate typically involves many investigative phases  including storage  retrieval  analysis  review  communication  management and manipulation of large volumes of information relating to chemical structures and properties  molecular patterns  statistical information  reactions involved in syntheses and biological properties 
based on industry data  the average pharmaceutical discovery process requires synthesis and testing of over  chemical compounds for each new product brought to market 
the company s products are used primarily in the pre clinical phases of new pharmaceutical development  the equivalent pre approval phase of agrochemical product development and product discovery phases of chemical research 
these phases can represent up to of the expense of new product research and development 
industry pressure to reduce product development cost and time to market are in part attributable to increased competition and increased political  regulatory and consumer scrutiny 
by reducing the time to market  pharmaceutical companies can generate billions of dollars of additional profits 
in addition  environmental regulations and consumer activism are forcing chemical and agrochemical companies to evaluate alternative products and means of doing business  thereby increasing their product development and operating costs 
through the use of effective integrated discovery information and analysis software in the key initial stages of new compound research and development  companies in these industries may be able to evaluate scientific data faster and more cost efficiently for the creation of new chemical lead candidates 
the industries served by the company have special requirements for the communication and analysis of chemical and biological data and the company is uniquely qualified to fulfill these requirements 
pharmaceutical and biotech companies have focused their r d efforts on both novel compounds exhibiting demonstrable benefits over existing commercial drugs and on novel targets  many of which are emerging from work being done on the human genome project 
many companies are implementing high throughput screening laboratories with robotic systems for the rapid analysis of large numbers of compounds for biological activity 
an outgrowth of this development is the increased need for material to screen  or to test 
companies are buying thousands of compounds a year to screen in order to find a novel compound with the desired biological activity 
the company believes it is positioned to provide these compounds through its collaboration with mds panlabs  inc of bothell  washington  its newly acquired laboratories at tripos receptor research  and its worldwide sales organization for distribution of compounds from these sources and from third party suppliers 
by coupling compounds with discovery informatics  tripos offers its customers increased discovery efficiencies 
tripos receptor research has established partnerships with major companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  supplying pure  novel chemical compounds for biological applications in new drug discovery

computational or medicinal chemists who need to choose representative subsets from a very large number of compounds will be interested in chemenlighten 
researchers who are using hierarchical clustering as a step towards selection will also want to examine chemenlighten for the optisim algorithm  which gives selection sets that have the same properties as sets from hierarchical clustering 
gasp chemical structure analysis tool gasp genetic algorithm similarity program uses a genetic algorithm to align sets of flexible molecules  where the genetic algorithm selects alignments with more pharmacophore overlaps between the molecules in the set 
drs 
gareth jones  peter willett and robert glen developed the gasp algorithm at the university of sheffield and the wellcome research laboratories 
tripos has incorporated this algorithm in a web based application 
gasp is designed to allow medicinal chemists to perform molecular alignments and analyze the results in order to assist in the decision process of what compounds should be synthesized next 
it is easy for the medicinal chemists to collaborate with one or more molecular modelers who can help optimize the setup and assist in analyzing the pharmacophore information in the results 
gasp is very easy to use and requires no prior knowledge regarding either the constraints or the pharmacophore

its customers have always ranked the company highly when it comes to providing helpful and timely assistance 
discovery software products and software consulting services combine to provide a solid business offering to the pharmaceutical  agrochemical  and biotechnology markets 
accelerated discovery services compounds recent advances in the area of high throughput screening rapid screening of compounds for biological activity have given rise to the need for large numbers of compounds by pharmaceutical  biotechnology and other life science companies 
these companies routinely acquire thousands of compounds a year to screen in search of novel classes of active compounds 
by applying the company s compound design technology in conjunction with the synthesis technology of mds panlabs  inc  the company has brought to market optiverse  a diverse library of over  screening compounds 
this library provides an efficient source of compounds for screening by removing redundant and ineffective samples from the screening effort 
a key advantage of the optiverse library is that each compound is representative of a cluster of similar compounds numbering in the thousands 
when optiverse compounds demonstrate activity in pharmaceutical company assays  the company can quickly and efficiently provide hundreds of similar compounds for follow up screening and lead optimization 
chemspace tripos has developed unique and proprietary technology for the storage and searching of vast numbers of combinatorial products and related data 
the unique searching methods enable the user to identify new compounds which are likely to have similar activity to the original molecule while avoiding problematic side effects or toxicity 
using this technology  tripos has rapidly created a database of over trillion synthetically accessible small organic chemical structures that are searchable in real time at the rate of billion per hour 
the database can be customized to include reactions and compounds that are proprietary to its customer base 
tripos is licensing this technology to a limited number of pharmaceutical companies 
contract research the reforms in health care have forced pharmaceutical and related companies to restructure their operations  including their research programs 
one of the results of this restructuring is a significant emphasis on outsourcing and partnering on the part of the large pharmaceutical companies with smaller technology companies 
at the same time  the rapid development of certain technologies  including combinatorial chemistry and high throughput screening  have forced many of the smaller companies to look to outside groups to provide needed technology rather than invest in it themselves 
this significant trend in outsourcing has presented the opportunity for the company to offer its expertise to these organizations through compound design  molecular analysis  and a complete suite of lead discovery and lead optimization capabilities 
tripos leverages these capabilities by entering into research agreements with its customers 
collaborative research the collaborative research group has two purposes 
one is to focus on internal discovery collaborations with arena pharmaceuticals and the cruciform group  and on associated opportunities such as that provided by our collaboration with phase molecular toxicology 
the second goal is to focus on external discovery collaborations with customer companies 
tripos is engaged in finding collaborative partnerships in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology  and related industries using any or all aspects of research that tripos has access to or can provide directly 
across all areas  tripos will work with customers using their own targets or targets that we identify through our collaborations 
tripos is combining its strengths in molecular design  combinatorial chemistry  and data capture with the pioneering expertise of complimentary organizations 
our investments and collaborative efforts are structured to deliver long term revenue and profits based on successful research that lead to new broad based products when partnered with pharmaceutical  biotechnology  and related companies 
this unit is dedicated to managing efforts critical to the success of these projects and investments

on december   the company s sales force consisted of management  technical  sales and administrative employees for the united states and canada  in europe  and for the pacific rim 
the company s domestic sales and support center is located at its headquarters in st 
louis  missouri 
the company also maintains sales offices in california  new jersey  and suburbs of london  paris and munich 
for its software product lines for workstations  the company employs pre sales and post sales support scientists resident in the united states  england  france  and germany 
these scientists  working in collaboration with the company s sales employees  have developed a consultative sales approach through which the company has created relationships with its key customers 
the company believes these relationships enable the company to understand and better serve the information management needs of its customers 
because the company s customers frequently have both domestic and international operations  the company s sales staff and scientists in foreign locations work closely with their counterparts in the united states to ensure that the customer s international needs are met in a coordinated and consistent fashion 
the company s workstation based software products are sold in a variety of ways  one of which is term licenses on the basis of a fixed number of simultaneous users per module 
network based licensing is available  based on a count of the number of simultaneous users 
the company has also introduced one  two and three year flexible license options that offer customers the flexibility to change their product selections periodically and are renewable at the end of the selected terms 
the company expects to migrate its customer base to shorter term license renewals based on the flexibility to access all of its software products 
this will provide a predictable recurring revenue stream from periodic renewals 
software packages consisting of modules typically purchased by customers in particular industry segments have been defined and have been specially priced to facilitate customer purchase of an optimal module set for their problems 
software consulting services are sold on a collaborative basis by direct salespersons and scientists to the end user chemist and information technology departments at the customer site 
each contract is negotiated based on the custom software service needs of the customer 
the term of the contract can last from two weeks up to two years 
the company provides programming and scientific expertise on a cost plus margin basis 
sales of the compound libraries are made through a staff assigned to the product 
tripos has dedicated sales professionals in the united states and europe along with distributors in the pacific rim 
the optiverse library now includes over  compounds that are available for purchase 
the compounds are sold on a nonexclusive basis to all purchasers and tripos retains no trailing rights to the compounds once they are purchased by a customer 
the company s sales staff includes employees with phd degrees in chemistry  various advanced degrees in the sciences and work experience with various hardware and software suppliers as well as with the industries served by the company 
the company s sales representatives are compensated through a combination of base salary  commissions and bonuses based on quarterly and annual sales performance 
in addition  the company s pre sales scientists  all of whom have phd degrees in chemistry or a closely related field  receive a compensation determined in part by their success in supporting and generating sales in a particular territory 
contract research relationships are offered through a team comprised of salespersons  discovery scientists and members of the senior management staff of the company 
this approach is best suited for the long cycle of developing meaningful partnerships with key customers for the outsourcing of discovery research 
the company exhibits its software at various scientific conferences and trade exhibitions  including national and regional conferences of the american chemical society and the pittsburgh conference 
company scientists frequently publish and present results of original research at these and other conferences throughout the world 
the company sells its personal computer software products principally through direct mail and relationships with distributors 
customer training  service and support the company s licenses typically provide a limited warranty for a day period 
thereafter  support of the company s software products is provided for an annual fee 
approximately of the company s commercial customers and half of the company s academic customers have contracted for support service 
this service gives customers access to telephone consultation with the company s technical personnel in local offices  on line access to a company operated computer bulletin board  new release versions of licensed software and other support required to utilize the company s products effectively 
the company offers customer training in the use of its products through staff knowledgeable in both chemistry and computer science 
the company sends technical newsletters  bulletins  and advance notification about future software releases to its customers to keep them informed and to help them with resource allocation and scheduling 
the company also sponsors seminars throughout the world for its customers  involving presentations both by company personnel and guest lecturers 
these seminars are designed to enhance customer understanding of the company s products and their potential utilization as an aid to customer research requirements 
the company currently provides its customers with advice on computer system configuration management and frequently provides customers with consulting advice in addressing particular research questions as part of the normal pre and post sales process 
product development the company believes that its position as a leader in discovery products and services will depend in large part on its ability to enhance its current product line  develop new products  maintain technological competitiveness  integrate complimentary third party products and meet a rapidly evolving range of customer requirements 
the company intends to continue to make substantial investments in product and technology development to meet its customers requirements 
the company has previously experienced delays in developing new products ranging from a few days to approximately twelve months 
the complexity of developing new and enhanced scientific information management software in a client server environment is significant 
delays or unexpected difficulties in any segment of a development project can result in late or undeliverable product 
in view of this complexity  there can be no certainty that the company will be able to introduce its products on a timely basis in the future  or that the company s new products and product enhancements will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance 
the company s research and development activities are undertaken by its discovery software group and its accelerated discovery services group 
the discovery software group  composed of chemists and other scientists  works closely with customers to identify market needs for new products 
upon identification of a market need for a new product  the discovery software group collaborates with the company s software engineers to develop requirements and specifications  implement code and perform regression tests for the new product 
separate quality assurance  environment management and systems groups manage the final release  documentation and porting of the new product to all supported platforms 
in addition  the company funds research at certain academic institutions 
the company believes that this funding allows it to gain access to significant technology not otherwise available 
the accelerated discovery services group has its own staff of scientists and programmers that are familiar with the research techniques and goals of its customers 
tripos and mds panlabs defined the market for diverse screening libraries with the introduction of optiverse in late anticipating the shift of the market from screening libraries to highly purified individual compounds  the companies jointly invested to produce a purified version of this library 
the implementation of this strategy challenged the state of the art in chemical purification 
after more than nine months delay  the development of specialized apparatus to accomplish this task has been completed 
tripos and mds panlabs are vigorously pursuing synthesis of new library compounds and purification of new and existing inventory 
the company is also complementing the internally produced libraries with compounds from external sources 
while the company anticipates returning to a growth position by the third quarter of  there remain significant challenges in this business 
the company has recently entered into laboratory operations through its acquisition of tripos receptor research 
while the staff at that organization is experienced and highly skilled  tripos may experience delays in expansion and growth of this organization 
research and development expenses were million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
research and development expenses  including the amount of capitalized costs were million in  million in and in  representing  and of net sales  respectively 
the company capitalized million of product development costs in  million in and million in this represented  and of total product research and development expenditures in these periods 
the company anticipates that its investment in new product research will continue to be significant as tripos invests in the growth of web based tools  desktop applications  diverse compound libraries  and its recently acquired laboratory facilities 
the company has entered into consulting contracts with certain customers which provide for collaboration with the company in customizing chemical compound libraries for drug discovery in specific therapeutic areas 
the company recognizes revenue related to such agreements as contractual milestones are achieved and delivered or  absent such contractual milestones  on a completed contract basis 
tripos offers its customers software consulting services by which the company builds customized systems solutions 
chemical research teams require improved information access and usage in their discovery process 
the company is helping its customers meet these needs by applying its expertise in web technologies  chemical information systems  and biological data handling to build integrated systems designed specifically for the customer s environment and discovery process 
proprietary rights the company relies primarily upon a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and license and non disclosure agreements to establish and protect the proprietary rights in its products 
in addition  the company has obtained one patent with respect to its sybyl qsar product which expires june  the company has just recently been granted a patent on hologram qsar 
during the years and  the company applied for five additional patents 
the source code for the company s products is protected both as a trade secret and as an unpublished  copyrighted work 
in addition  the company s software products are developed and manufactured only at its st 
louis facility and the company does not disclose the source code for its products to any of its subsidiaries or distributors 
the company supplies its source code under special  restrictive license provisions to customers on special request 
all software products are shipped from its st 
louis facility 
optiverse chemical compound libraries are manufactured and shipped by mds panlabs  inc at its bothell  washington location 
targeted compound libraries are manufactured and shipped by tripos receptor research from its bude  england facilities 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use the company s products or technology without authorization  or to develop similar technology independently 
in addition  effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries where the company does business 
because the markets in which the company competes are characterized by rapid technological change  the company believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel  new product development  frequent product enhancements  name recognition and reliable product maintenance are more important to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position than the various legal protections of its technology 
the company licenses its workstation software through the execution of license agreements 
the company licenses its personal computer software products by use of a shrink wrap license 
a shrink wrap license agreement is a printed license agreement included within packaged software that sets forth the terms and conditions under which the purchaser can use the product and is intended to bind the purchaser  by the purchaser s acceptance of the software  to such terms and conditions 
the company has a number of contracts with academic institutions and individuals providing the company the right to license  market and use technology developed outside the company 
these products  while important for the company s ability to offer an enriched product line  do not represent a material percentage of the company s annual revenue 
compound  consulting  contract research and collaborative agreements require specific documentation regarding defined proprietary rights  responsibilities of the parties  and or allowed use of any related compounds or libraries of compounds 
competition the company operates in a highly competitive industry characterized by rapidly changing technology  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  and evolving industry standards 
the company competes with other vendors of software products designed for applications in analytical chemistry  computational chemistry  chemical information management  and combinatorial chemistry  the four principal areas in the chemical and pharmaceutical research market 
the company s accelerated discovery services group competes with other vendors for the sale of contract research  targeted libraries and diverse compound libraries 
competition is likely to intensify as current competitors expand their product offerings and as new companies enter the market 
the competition experienced by the company in its existing and targeted markets could result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share  all of which could have an adverse effect on the company 
a number of the company s existing competitors have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than the company 
the company believes that the principal factors affecting competition in its markets are product quality  performance  reliability  ease of use  technical service and support  and price 
it is expected that these factors will remain major competitive issues in the future  but additional factors will become increasingly important  including contribution to the overall efficiency of the research effort through enhanced integration  communication and analysis 
although the company believes that it currently competes favorably with respect to these factors  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that the competitive pressures faced by the company will not have a material effect on its business  operating results or financial condition 
production the company s software production operations consist of assembling  packaging and shipping the software and database products and documentation needed to fulfill orders 
outside vendors provide cd rom duplication  printing of documentation  manufacturing of packaging materials and assembly of the company s desktop products 
the company typically ships its software products promptly after the acceptance of a customer purchase order and the execution of a software license agreement 
accordingly  the company does not generally have any significant software backlog  and the company believes that backlog at any particular time  or fluctuations in backlog  are not indicative of sales for any succeeding period 
optiverse chemical compounds are designed by tripos and manufactured by mds panlabs  inc at their bothell  washington facility 
compound sales are shipped shortly after the execution of a sales contract between the customer  mds panlabs and tripos 
the potential for backlogs exists in the delivery of compounds due to the nature of the materials to be accumulated  packaged and shipped along with the sometimes lengthy compound selection process of the customer 
backlogs will fluctuate based on the number  size and timing of orders received 
while backlogs at tripos receptor research in bude  england have been immaterial in the past  they may experience comparable obstacles in shipment preparation of targeted libraries or custom compound libraries 
significant customers the company does not derive or more of its total sales from any single customer 
international sales the company sells its software products through its wholly owned subsidiaries in europe  through an exclusive distributor in japan  and through non exclusive agency relationships in singapore  china  korea  and taiwan 
net sales from the company s activities outside of north america represented approximately  and of the company s total net sales in   and  respectively 
net sales in europe accounted for  and of the company s net sales in   and  respectively  with the balance from customers in the pacific rim 
the company believes that revenues from its foreign activities will continue to account for a significant percentage of its total net sales 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  geographic segment data  in the company s annual report 
employees as of december   the company had a total of employees  of whom were based in the united states and were based internationally 
of that total  were engaged in marketing  sales and related customer support services  in product development  in chemistry laboratory activities and in operations  administration  mis and finance 
the company s future success is significantly dependent on the continued service of its key technical and senior management personnel and its continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview tripos  inc is a discovery research company with unique expertise in molecular informatics 
tripos supplies software  chemical compound libraries and collaborative research services to the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and other life science industries worldwide 
except for the historical information and statements contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a  the matters and items contained in this document  including md a  contain certain forward looking statements that involve uncertainties and risks  some of which are discussed below  including under the caption cautionary statements additional important factors to be considered 
the company is under no obligation to update any forward looking statements in this section 
the company s revenues and expenses can vary from quarter to quarter depending upon  among other things  the capital expenditure budgets of its customers  lengthy sales cycles  market acceptance of new products and enhanced versions of existing products  the timing of new product introductions by the company and other vendors  changes in pricing policies by the company  partners and other vendors  and changes in general economic and competitive conditions 
in addition  a substantial portion of the company s revenues for each quarter is attributable to a limited number of orders and tends to be realized toward the end of each quarter 
thus  even short delays or deferrals of sales near the end of a quarter can cause quarterly results to fluctuate substantially 
the company typically experiences greater gross margins on software licenses  contract research  custom software development and chemical compound sales than on sales of hardware 
the company s profitability depends in part on the mix of its revenue components and not necessarily on total revenues 
the company provides software licenses that are activated and remain active based on the date and time of the computer where the software resides 
the company relies on the hardware suppliers to address any and all year issues and provide letters of compliance to the company 
the total dollar amount that the company estimates will be spent to remediate its year issues will not be material and should not affect future financial results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain consolidated financial data as a percentage of net sales  except costs of sales data  which is set forth as a percentage of the corresponding net sales data net sales software licenses support accelerated discovery services hardware total net sales cost of sales software licenses support accelerated discovery services hardware total cost of sales gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative restructuring charge total operating expenses income loss from operations other income expense  net net income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss net sales net sales increased approximately from million in to million in  and increased in to million 
these fluctuations in net sales were principally attributable to sales of diverse chemical compound libraries in the accelerated discovery services ads business 
the changes were augmented by increases in software and support sales 
new product sales represented of software license sales in  in  and in tripos generates a substantial portion of its revenues from the pharmaceutical industry 
net sales to this industry accounted for approximately   and of the company s total net sales in   and  respectively 
the company sells its products and services directly in north america  through its wholly owned subsidiaries in europe  through an exclusive distributor arrangement in japan  and through non exclusive agency relationships in china  korea  singapore and taiwan 
net sales from the company s activities outside of north america represented approximately  and of the company s total net sales in  and  respectively 
net sales in europe accounted for   and of the company s net sales in   and  respectively  with the balance from customers in the pacific rim area  principally japan 
the company believes that revenues from its foreign activities will continue to account for a significant percentage of its total net sales 
list prices for the company s products have remained relatively stable over the last few years 
in  the company started selling flexible software licenses in addition to perpetual licenses 
a flexible license includes a minimum level of modules for a minimum total price 
in  of software license sales were sold in the form of a flexible license 
as a result of selling more modules through flexible licenses  the average software license revenue per customer has increased 
the sale price for the chemical compound libraries increased slightly as a result of the increase in the size and number of the orders in versus when the product was introduced 
in  the demand for a highly purified product caused a decline in the number of large orders for the entire chemical compound library resulting in a decline in the number of orders and the average sales price 
in  existing customers represented of total net sales compared with in increasing net sales from period to period is dependent  in part  on the company s ability to introduce new products which are accepted by the market and on the company s ability to penetrate new and existing markets 
software license sales increased from million in to million in and increased to million in the increase in and is attributable to the increase in the number of new products introduced  the increase in orders of worldwide licenses for the large pharmaceutical companies  the increased penetration into the biotechnology sector  a large custom software development contract and flexible term licensing 
support sales increased from million in to million in  and increased to million in the increase in and is primarily due to a larger installed base of customers with more modules per customer as a result of the overall increase in software license sales in the prior years 
the company introduced the accelerated discovery services ads product line in september through an alliance with mds panlabs  inc  the company sells diverse compound libraries and contract research 
the company also licenses its chemspace technology through this product line 
ads sales increased to million in from million in and decreased to million in the increase in compound library revenue in is due to the increase in the number of compounds available for sale  from  to  and a larger sales and distribution force 
the decrease in is due to a shift in the market which demanded a highly purified chemical compound library 
despite the anticipation of this demand and the purchase of a specialized apparatus for compound purification  the delay in receipt of equipment and subsequent further delay in the purification process caused a nine month slippage in new product 
in april  the partnership agreed to shift mds panlabs resources from continued synthesis of the existing product line to purification of the existing library to generate new products 
in december  the company and mds panlabs started restructuring their agreement 
it is possible that the collaboration will terminate and while the companies will continue to market the existing chemical compound library  they may discontinue production of a new library 
in addition  the company is seeking highly pure third party diverse chemical compounds for distribution to continue generating revenue from this market 
the company expects to return to growth in ads sales by third quarter hardware revenues were million in and and increased by to million in the increase in reflects an increase in the average order amount from customers who purchased the company s software bundled with the hardware 
cost of sales total cost of sales increased from million in to million in and  which represents  and  respectively  of total net sales 
the cost of the diverse compound libraries was the principal factor in the overall increase in cost of sales in in  the decline in the costs of diverse compound libraries as a result of the decline in sales was offset by the increase in hardware costs corresponding to the increase in hardware sales 
costs of software licenses represented  and of software license sales in   and  respectively 
costs of software licenses consists of amortization of capitalized software  royalties to third party developers  and the cost of software product packaging and media 
the cost of software licenses as a percentage of software license sales decreased in due to a decrease in royalties paid to distributors in the pacific rim due to a decline in revenues in that territory for the year 
costs of support represented  and of support sales in   and  respectively 
cost of support principally consists of software product packaging  media and updates to documentation 
the increase in costs of sales for support in is based on the shipment of a major release of software to a base of over customers 
the decrease in is due to lowered costs of documentation 
costs of ads represented  and of ads sales in   and  respectively 
cost of ads represent the costs associated with the design and creation of the diverse compound libraries 
the decrease in the costs of ads as a percentage of sales is due to the increase of higher margin contract research and chemspace revenues  and the decrease in the royalties for the chemical compound libraries as a result of the decline in the sales of the library 
the company expects the costs of this product line to decline slightly as a percentage of sales in the future as contract research and chemspace revenues become a higher percentage of the product mix 
costs of hardware represented  and of hardware sales in  and  respectively 
cost of hardware consists primarily of the costs of hardware sold 
the company expects the cost of hardware as a percentage of hardware sales to remain relatively stable in future periods 
gross profit gross profit was million in  million in  and million in  which represents gross profits of  and  respectively 
the decrease in the gross profit percentage was due to the increase in compound library sales which have higher cost of sales than software and support 
the increase in the gross profit was due to a decline in the percentage of compound library sales and an increase in higher margin software license  support  contract research and chemspace sales 
the company believes that gross profit will improve as higher margin contract research and software license revenues increase 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in  and decreased to million in the increase in was primarily due to the expansion of the sales and marketing organization in europe for the sale of the ads product line  the creation of a business development and strategic relations department  and increases in marketing and selling of new products 
the decrease in was due to a reclassification of certain expenses to general administrative and a decrease in overall sales costs 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased from in to in  and decreased to in the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales is a function of increased sales along with improved efficiencies among the sales and marketing staff 
the company expects total sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales to decline slightly in the future as cost efficiencies continue to be implemented in the worldwide sales and marketing staff 
research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased from million in to million in  and increased to million in  representing   and of net sales  respectively 
the decrease in was primarily due to the reduction in development staff resulting from the discontinuation of the unison product in december the increase in is due to the decrease in the amount of capitalized costs as the company moves from long term software development cycles to a shorter term development cycle for web based software applications 
research and development expenses  including the amount of capitalized costs were million in  million in and million in which represents   and of net sales  respectively 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the company capitalizes software development costs 
the company also capitalizes compound library creation and design costs 
the total amount of costs capitalized was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
this represented  and of total product research and development expenditures in these periods 
the company anticipates that its investment in new product research will remain at comparable levels as tripos continues development in web based tools  desktop applications  diverse compound libraries and expands its recently acquired laboratory facilities 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in and  representing   and of net sales  respectively 
the increase in expenses in is the result of an increase in the bad debt provision  increased shareholder relations activities and funding the company incentive bonus pool for exceeding operating income goals 
in  the decline in the company sponsored bonus pool was offset by the reclassification of certain expenses that were considered sales marketing expenses in the company expects general and administrative to remain at comparable levels in the future 
restructuring charge the company incurred a non recurring restructuring charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of related to the discontinuation of development  marketing and sales of the unison product line 
the company discontinued this line in conjunction with an alliance which was formed with its major competitor in the market where this product was sold 
this alliance allowed the company to reallocate certain resources to the continued development of other product lines 
the charge represented the write off of previously capitalized development costs  write down of assets used in product development  settlement of contractual obligations  and severance costs 
all cash outlays related to the restructuring for severance costs and settlement of contractual obligations have been paid out as of december  the amount reserved for these cash outlays was estimated at  and occurred principally in the first quarter of the source of funding was cash generated from operations 
the remaining components of the restructuring charge represented the write down of previously capitalized development costs of million and the write off of equipment used in the development of the product of  the effects of the restructuring plan on operating results for and were realized through reduced annual amortization charges of  and reduced labor costs of  the impact on annual revenues in and were considered minimal as the unison product contributed less than of software license sales in interest income interest income of  in   in and  in  was from interest earned on investments 
the increase in interest income in was due to the addition of interest bearing notes receivable 
income tax expense the company s tax expense benefit was  in   in and million in the company s effective tax rate was  and for  and  respectively 
the effective rates for and reflect the impact of net operating loss carryforwards for which current benefits were not recognized until the second quarter of liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital decreased from million in to million in the decrease in working capital is the result of the company s investment in arena pharmaceuticals corporation  the purchase of its corporate office building and the acquisition of tripos receptor research ltd 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased from million in to million in this was primarily due to an increase in notes receivable of million for customer accounts receivable from flexible license sales offset by an increase in deferred revenue of million due to both increased support billings at year end and flexible software license contracts for the year 
net cash used in investing activities increased from million in to million in the increase relates to the investment in arena pharmaceuticals and phase molecular toxicology  the purchase of its corporate office building and tripos receptor research offset by the decrease in capitalized development costs and the proceeds from sales of investments throughout the year 
the company invests available cash in bank deposits  investment grade securities and  short term interest producing instruments  including government obligations and other money market instruments 
the company anticipates that capital purchases will be comparable to due to the expansion of the facilities at the company s tripos receptor research subsidiary which will be funded through operating activities 
net cash provided by financing activities increased from million in to million in as the result of issuance of long term debt for the purchase of the corporate office building and stock issued pursuant to stock purchase and option plans 
management believes that with the current cash position of million  short term investments of million  accounts receivable of million  continued cash flow from operations  availability of a million line of credit  and total current liabilities of million  the company will be able to meet both its liquidity needs and capital expenditure needs for the next twelve months 
management believes that the company will be able to satisfy its known long term liabilities and liquidity needs through the funding sources identified above 
the company may seek to obtain additional financing at any time in connection with the company s product development efforts and its efforts to penetrate existing and new markets for its products and services  depending upon the associated working capital requirements 
foreign currency translations the company s foreign operations transact the majority of their business in their respective local currencies and are therefore generally not exposed to foreign currency gains or losses 
due to the relative stability of the currency of the countries in which the company operates and the level of investment in each country  the company s current intent is to retain assets within its foreign operations to fund those operations 
the company s foreign currency transaction gains and losses have not been significant to date  and management believes the company s exposure to future foreign currency transaction gains and losses is minimal 
cautionary statements additional important factors to be considered the company s future results could differ materially from those discussed in this document 
factors that could contribute to such differences  include  but are not limited to  the following rapid technological change 
the software and discovery research industries are characterized by rapid change and uncertainty due to new and emerging technologies 
the pace of change has recently accelerated due to the internet  combinatorial chemistry software products  market demand for high throughput purified chemical compound libraries and combinatorial chemistry companies entering the market 
there can be no assurance that tripos will be successful in developing or acquiring product enhancements and new products necessary to keep pace with the changing technologies 
customer acceptance 
while the company provides a database of the chemical compounds in its library and performs extensive usability and beta testing of its new software products  user acceptance and corporate penetration rates ultimately dictate the success of development and marketing efforts 
competition 
the software and discovery research industry are highly competitive 
a number of companies offer products that target these markets 
tripos competes with software and discovery research vendors for the research budgets of pharmaceutical  biotechnology  agrochemical and related companies 
it is possible that there will be consolidation in the market of competitive software and discovery research vendors 
certain of the company s competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and sales resources than tripos 
dependence on and relationship with mds panlabs  inc in  the company announced a collaboration with mds panlabs  inc  a contract research organization in bothell  wa 
the collaboration is for contract research sales and the sales of compound libraries 
the company is responsible for the design  sales and marketing of the libraries  while mds panlabs is responsible for the synthesis  storage and shipment of the libraries 
in  of the company s sales were from the ads business where the revenues from the collaboration are reported 
in  of the company s revenues were from the sale of chemical compound libraries  chemspace and contract research 
this decline is due to a shift in the market to demand a highly purified chemical compound library 
despite the anticipation of this demand and the purchase of a specialized apparatus for compound purification  the delay in receipt of equipment and subsequent further delay in the purification process caused a nine month slippage in new product 
in april  the partnership agreed to shift mds panlabs resources from continued synthesis of the existing product line to purification of the existing library to generate new products 
in december  the company and mds panlabs started restructuring their agreement 
it is possible that the collaboration will terminate and while the companies will continue to market the existing chemical compound library  they may discontinue the production of the new library 
the company is seeking highly pure third party diverse chemical compounds for distribution to continue generating revenue from this market 
dependence on key personnel 
tripos continued success depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of its president and ceo  john p 
mcalister  and other key technical and senior management personnel 
the loss of the services of dr 
mcalister or any other key personnel  and the inability of the company to attract and retain suitable replacements could have a material adverse effect on the company 
possible acquisitions 
the company may make acquisitions in the future 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations and products of the acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which the company has no or little direct experience  and potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies
