item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on its loans  mortgage backed and debt and equity securities and the interest paid on its deposits and other borrowings 
the company s results of operations are also affected by its provision for loan losses  non interest income and non interest expense 
in addition  the company s results of operations are significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
future changes in applicable law  regulations or government policies also may materially impact the company 
management strategy the company s goal is to enhance shareholder value by being the premier community bank in its market area 
management s objectives toward accomplishing this goal are to aggressively market its lending products while maintaining credit quality  seek low cost sources of funds  deliver excellent customer service through an efficient  low cost network and provide a fair return on investor s capital 
the company employs the following principal strategies to accomplish these objectives it seeks to originate or purchase with servicing rights one to four family residential mortgage loans  consumer loans  primarily secured by junior liens on residential real estate  and federal housing administration fha title insured home improvement loans  the company seeks to invest funds in excess of loan demand in mortgage backed securities  classified as available for sale  which have risks and yields similar to mortgages the company would have otherwise originated or purchased  it seeks to originate securitized commercial loans for equipment  inventory  working capital  real estate and other business purposes  it seeks to utilize its strong capital position  by borrowing funds to originate or purchase loans  or to invest in mortgage backed securities  which are classified as available for sale  and whose average life  considering expected prepayments  is consistent with five and ten year treasury instruments  it seeks to control its operating expenses by effectuating productivity savings from new systems and procedures  as well as through optimization of its retail delivery sites and systems  it seeks to offer superior service and competitive rates to maintain its existing core deposit base  it seeks  through enhanced marketing strategy  product cross selling and branch expansions  to increase its core deposit base  it seeks to manage its capital through analysis of current alternatives for capital deployment  and it seeks to reduce its exposure to interest rate risk by purchasing and originating floating rate commercial loans  consumer loans  adjustable rate first mortgage loans arm  and fixed rate first mortgage loans with terms to maturity of no more than fifteen years  as well as by emphasizing retention and growth of core deposits and investing in mortgage backed securities  which it classifies as available for sale  and whose expected lives are comparable to five and ten year treasury instruments 
in conjunction with its strategies  management expects that non residential mortgage and commercial loans will constitute a greater percentage of the company s loan portfolio in future periods 
as a consequence of management s lending strategy  the company may  in future periods  depending upon then current conditions  increase its provision for loan losses as well as its provision for losses on real estate owned over that experienced in the company s most recent fiscal period 
results of operations as discussed more fully in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the company changed from a fiscal year end of march st to a calendar year end  effective with the calendar year commencing january  for purposes of setting forth a meaningful comparison for management s discussion and analysis  years ended december   and are presented

net income and earnings per share  assuming dilution  for increased and  respectively as compared to this increase is primarily the result of increased net interest income from the growth in average loans and investments at higher yields offset by an increase in borrowing costs due to increased average borrowing levels 
partially offsetting this net interest income growth was lower non interest income and increased non interest expense 
in addition  the company s average weighted shares outstanding during declined to  as compared to  during  reflecting the company s stock repurchase programs 
net interest income 
net interest income is the principal source of income for the company and represents the difference between total interest and fees earned on loans  mortgage backed securities and other investments  and total interest incurred on deposits and borrowed funds

the average balance of interest earning assets increased million  or  to million for compared to million for the related yields increased between the two periods to from 
throughout  the company changed its mix of interest earning assets by purchasing one to four family residential mortgages  and selling lower yielding mortgage backed securities and debt securities 
in addition  the company has focused its efforts on originating higher yielding commercial and consumer loans reflecting increases in average balances of and  respectively in these portfolios 
as a result  both the average balance and yield from interest earning assets is higher for the average balance of first mortgage loans increased million  or  as a result of the prior year purchases partially offset by current year repayments  net of originations 
however  yields on this portfolio decreased basis points from for to for  because of prepayments of higher yielding loans in the current low interest rate environment

interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  to million for compared to million for interest expense on deposits decreased million while interest expense on borrowed funds increased million 
the increase in borrowed funds was due to increased borrowing levels coupled with a basis point rise in average costs 
the decrease in interest expense on total deposits was primarily caused by decreases in higher costing certificates of deposit partially offset by growth in core deposits 
average borrowed funds during increased million  or  to million as compared to million for the increase in the average balance of borrowed funds reflects the company s continued strategy to leverage its excess capital  and this growth funded the increase in commercial mortgage and business loans  consumer loans  and mortgage backed securities 
in addition these funds were also used in part to support the repurchase of the company s common stock and in part to liquidate certificates of deposit for holders who sought rates higher than the company s alternate borrowing rates 
the cost of borrowed funds increased basis points to for from for the increase in rates reflected the company s decision to migrate a greater portion of its short term borrowed funds into longer term instruments which lessens the impact of changes in short term borrowing rates

borrowings of million with interest rates ranging from to are first callable in  and borrowings of million with interest rates of are first callable in november total interest expense on deposits for totaled million compared to million for the decrease in interest expense on deposits resulted primarily from the decrease of higher costing certificates of deposit and the change in mix of deposits during total average deposits increased million during resulting from decreases in certificates of deposit of million  offset by increases in savings  now and non interest bearing deposits of million 
the weighted average cost of interest bearing deposits during decreased basis points from in to in although average deposits increased during the current year  period end deposit balances decreased million primarily due to controlled runoff of certificates of deposit throughout the year 
the company s strategy during was to not match the competition s aggressive rates  unless management believes that relationships with deposit holders who have other deposits or loan relationships are in jeopardy 
core deposits partially offset this decrease with growth of million  or  over period end balances as customer relationships were developed through continued marketing efforts

further provisions for loan losses will continue to be based upon management s assessment of the loan portfolio and its underlying collateral  trends in non performing loans  the current economic condition and other factors which may warrant recognition in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels sufficient to cover estimated losses 
at december   allowance for loan losses was million compared to million at december   an increase of million  or 
as of december   non performing loans  which consist of non accrual loans and accruing loans delinquent days or more  decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the coverage ratio of allowance for loan losses to non performing loans and also to net loans at december  was and  respectively  as compared to and  respectively at december  non interest income

proceeds from the sales approximated million and were used in conjunction with additional borrowings and deposits  to fund loan growth and for redeployment into higher yielding securities 
non interest expense 
non interest expense totaled million for  an increase of million  or  as compared to million for  exclusive of the one time saif assessment 
inclusive of the one time saif assessment  total non interest expense decreased million  or  from million for to million for salaries and employee benefits expenses for increased million  or  compared to the prior year 
of this amount  salaries expense increased million and employee benefit expenses increased million 
salaries expense increased primarily as a result of two new branches opened during  whose operations are fully reflected in the current year  and staffing costs for commercial and institutional loan officers and support hired during there is limited expense for these items in the prior year 
in addition  the current year also includes normal wage and salary increases 
employee benefit expense for includes an increase of  related to the company s employee stock ownership plan esop program over the same period of the prior year due to increases in the market value of the company s stock for the current year period

the current year decrease resulted primarily from a net lower cost for insurance coverage 
other non interest expense increased million to million for compared to million for advertising  marketing  and related printing were increased during as part of the company s efforts to increase loan and core deposit growth 
in addition  loan and deposit operations costs increased during as a result of greater transactional volumes from the prior year

partially offsetting this growth were decreases in debt and equity securities 
the growth in assets was primarily funded through fhlbny borrowings and by increased core deposits 
in addition  lower cost borrowed funds were used to fund the liquidation of higher rate certificates of deposit 
at december   shareholders equity was million  a decrease of million compared to million at december  the ratios of shareholders equity to total assets were at december  and at december  the decrease from december  resulted principally from the purchase on the open market and retirement of  shares of common stock for million at an average price of per share  and the payment of four quarterly dividends totaling million 
partially offsetting these decreases were net income of million  a reduction of million in the unallocated and unearned esop  employee rrp  and director rrp shares  a net increase of million net of taxes in the in the market value of the investment portfolio  and a tax benefit for rrp shares earned 
lending activities loan portfolio composition 
at december   the company had total loans of million compared to million at december  the largest portion of the portfolio  million  or  was one to four family first mortgage loans 
other loan categories within the portfolio consist of consumer loans of million  or of the loan portfolio  and are primarily comprised of fixed rate second mortgage loans and fha title one insured home improvement loans  commercial mortgage and multi family loans of million  or of the loan portfolio  commercial business loans of million  or of the loan portfolio  and acquisition  development  and construction loans of million  or of the loan portfolio 
the types of loans that the company may originate or purchase are subject to federal and state law and regulations 
interest rates charged by the company on loans are affected principally by the demand for such loans and the supply of money available for lending purposes and the rates offered by the company s competitors 
these factors are  in turn  affected by general economic conditions  monetary policies of the federal government  including the federal reserve board  legislative tax policies and governmental budgetary matters 
first mortgage lending 
the company offers first mortgage loans secured by one to four family residences  including townhouse and condominium units 
typically  such residences are single family homes that serve as the primary residence of the owner 
loans may be internally originated or purchased from other sources such as mortgage bankers and other financial intermediaries 
one to four family residential mortgage loans are generally underwritten to federal national mortgage association fnma or federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc guidelines  except that loans may exceed the maximum loan limits for the fnma or the fhlmc 
during  as a result of a tightened interest rate environment and increased competition  total one to four family first mortgage loans decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this decrease reflected normal principal amortization and accelerated prepayments  partially offset by originations of million of one to four family first mortgage loans 
the company did not emphasize one to four family lending during  as the spreads between competitive rates being offered and the cost of funding with consideration of credit and duration risks  was not a sufficient incentive for new investment 
of the one to four family first mortgage loans outstanding at the current year end  were arm loans and were fixed rate and year loans 
the interest rate adjustment period on arm loans ranges between and years  and as of december   the weighted average adjustment period approximated years 
the company may offer arm loans on which the interest rate for an initial period may be less than the fully indexed rate  although to be eligible  the company requires that the borrower qualify for the maximum payment possible after the initial interest rate adjustment 
arm and fixed rate mortgages are originated for a term of up to years 
the company generally charges origination fees of up to on one to four family residential mortgage loans 
generally  arm loans pose credit risks different from the risks in fixed rate loans  primarily because as interest rates rise  the underlying payments of the borrower rise  thereby increasing the potential for default 
at the same time  the marketability of the underlying property may be adversely affected by higher interest rates 
the company has emphasized and plans to continue to emphasize the origination of commercial business  commercial mortgage  and multi family loans from in and around its market area 
the current non residential loan portfolio consists of loans to businesses located in and secured by properties in new jersey 
as a result of the company s emphasis  these loans continue to be the fastest growing segment of the company s loan portfolio 
the company s commercial and multi family real estate loan portfolio is secured primarily by apartment buildings  mixed use buildings  small office buildings and warehouses 
commercial and multi family real estate loans generally have terms that do not exceed years and have a variety of rate adjustment features and other terms 
the loans are usually made in amounts up to of the appraised value of the property securing the loan 
adjustable rate commercial and multi family real estate loans provide for a margin over either the us treasury security adjusted to a constant maturity of five years  with periodic adjustments after five years  or the prime rate as reported in the wall street journal  or to a lesser extent  the company also offers commercial and multi family real estate loans with a margin over short term us treasury securities or tied to other published indices 
in underwriting these loans  the company analyzes the current financial condition of the borrower  the borrower s credit history  and the reliability and predictability of the cash flow generated by the property securing the loan 
the company generally requires personal guarantees of the borrowers 
appraisals on properties securing commercial real estate loans originated by the company are performed by independent appraisers approved by the company s board of directors 
updated financial statements are generally obtained  reviewed and analyzed annually to assure the strength of the borrower 
multi family and commercial real estate loans present a higher level of risk than loans secured by one to four family residences 
this greater risk is due to several factors  including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers  the effect of general economic conditions on income producing properties and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans 
furthermore  the repayment of loans secured by multi family and commercial real estate is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related real estate project 
if the cash flow from the project is reduced for example  if leases are not obtained or renewed  or a bankruptcy court modifies a lease term  or a major tenant is unable to fulfill its lease obligations  the borrower s ability to repay the loan may be impaired 
commercial business loans 
during  the company continued with its strategy of focusing its efforts on the origination of commercial business loans 
these loans are secured by business assets other than real estate such as equipment  inventory  machinery  accounts receivable  and vehicles  and are usually guaranteed by principals of the business 
commercial business loans are in amounts which range from  to  at interest rates which are indexed to the prime rate  and for durations which coincide with the nature of the collateral  but not beyond ten years 
the company s target market is enterprises with annual sales between million and million 
commercial business loans present a higher level of risk than do loans secured by one to four family residences 
the company underwrites these loans by analyzing the current financial condition of the borrower including current and expected cash flows and historical and projected financial performance 
the company also analyzes the value of the collateral available as security  and the borrower s credit history 
the company seeks to maintain an active relationship with its commercial business borrowers in order to service their banking needs  and to keep current with their financial and operational condition 
at december   the company s total loan portfolio included million  or of commercial and multi family mortgage loans and million  or of commercial business loans 
the combined total of million at december  compares to million of like loans at december  in addition  at december   million  or of the company s total loan portfolio consisted of construction loans  an increase of million as compared to million at december  the growth in these product lines has been the consequence of management s strategy to develop higher yielding  variable rate based  non residential loans 
this strategy helps to diversify the company s loan offerings and portfolio mix 
consumer loans 
the company offers second mortgages secured by owner occupied residences wherein the property may not be encumbered by other than a first mortgage loan 
these loans are generally subject to a combined loan to value limitation  including any other outstanding mortgage or lien on the property 
as of december   second mortgage loans amounted to million  or of total loans  an increase of million  or  from december  the company also originates and purchases fha title improvement loans 
it originates these loans both on a direct basis and through a network of improvement contractors dealers who are approved by the company under fha guidelines 
the company purchases fha title improvement loans from fha approved lenders who have originated the loans in accordance with the company s lending criteria and within fha underwriting guidelines 
these guidelines provide for more liberal equity and debt to income ratios than for non fha improvement loans 
in the event of default  the fha insures of the principal balance plus accrued interest 
the interest rates are normally higher than the interest rates for one to four family mortgage loans due to the more liberal underwriting standards 
fha title improvement loans amounted to million  or of total loans at december  compared to million as of december   an increase of million  or 
remaining other loans are home equity lines of credit  other home improvement loans  secured and unsecured personal loans  and automobile loans

maintenance of asset quality is one of management s most important objectives 
management reviews delinquent loans on a continuous basis and  through an asset review committee which meets quarterly to review the company s loan portfolio  makes changes in the classification of assets which the committee deems necessary 
the company hires outside counsel experienced in collections and foreclosure to pursue collections and to institute foreclosure and other procedures on the company s delinquent loans 
lending policies are reviewed and approved annually by the board of directors of the company 
credit approval limits have been established for each of the company s loan officers  however  the company s loan committee approves all credit extensions exceeding  it is the company s policy for loans secured by real estate that an appraisal be obtained to ensure adequate value of the secured property and that title insurance be obtained on all first mortgage loans 
the company has engaged an independent consulting firm which specializes in loan reviews to perform loan reviews and provide independent reports to the company s board of directors quarterly 
in addition  loan officers monitor the company s loans outstanding to identify potentially deteriorating loan situations which are reported to the asset review committee 
this process allows management to implement a strategy to address potential credit concerns on a timely basis 
the company s internal audit department reviews loan documentation and collateral as part of its regular audit procedures 
delinquent loans and foreclosed assets federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets such as debt and equity securities considered by the ots to be of lesser quality as substandard  doubtful  or loss assets 
an asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the savings institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all of the weakness inherent in those classified substandard  with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values  highly questionable and improbable 
assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted 
assets that do not expose the savings institution to risk sufficient to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories  but which possess some weaknesses  are required to be designated special mention by management 
loans designated as special mention are generally loans that have exhibited some potential weakness that  if not corrected  could increase the level of risk in the future 
at december   the company had loans categorized as special mention of million  which consisted of million in first and second mortgage loans  and in commercial mortgage loans 
substandard assets totaled million and consisted of million in real estate owned reo  million in commercial loans  million in first and second mortgage loans  and million in consumer loans 
in addition  at that date  the company had doubtful loans of million consisting of first and second mortgage loans and million of loans classified as loss which are fully reserved 
reo is transferred from the loan portfolio at the lower of cost or estimated fair value 
if the estimated fair value is lower than cost  such difference is charged to the allowance for loan losses at the time of transfer 
the company also maintains a loss allowance for other real estate losses for subsequent declines to reduce the carrying book value to the estimated fair value of reo and estimated costs to sell 
interest is not accrued on fha insured home improvement loans where interest or principal is days or more past due  and on all other loans  where interest or principal is days or more past due  unless the loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
once the loans reach non accrual status  accrued but unpaid interest is reversed and interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent that payments are received 
interest on loans that have been restructured is accrued according to the renegotiated terms 
table below sets forth information regarding the company s non performing assets

for the years ended december    and  the amounts of interest income that would have been recorded on non accrual loans  had they been current  approximated million  million  and million  respectively 
also  for the years ended december    and  the amount of interest income on non performing loans that was included in income approximated   and  respectively 
the company s reo before allowance for losses on reo  was  at december  as compared to  at december  during   of new reo was acquired which was offset by the sale of  in existing reo properties 
the sales of reo reflects the continued efforts by the company to dispose of reo outstanding in a timely manner 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established through charges provisions for loan losses to earnings 
loan losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the recovery of principal is unlikely 
if  as a result of loans charged off or increases in the size or risk characteristics of the loan portfolio  management considers the allowance to be below the level necessary to absorb future loan losses on existing loans  an additional provision for loan losses is made to increase the allowance for loan losses to the level considered necessary to absorb possible losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
management considers such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality  review of specific problem loans and economic conditions that may affect the borrowers ability to pay and the realization of collateral in determining the adequacy of the allowance 
management believes that the allowance for losses on loans is adequate 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions in the company s market area 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for losses on loans 
such agencies may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
investment activities the company s earning assets  other than loans receivable  are its mortgage backed securities  debt and equity securities  and federal funds sold

in november  the fasb issued special report  a guide to implementation of statement on accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities within which there was offered transition guidance permitting an enterprise to reassess the appropriateness of the classifications of all of its securities before december  the company reassessed its classifications and on december   it transferred all of its securities previously classified as held to maturity  with an amortized cost of million  to the available for sale classification 
the related unrealized gain as of the date of transfer was  which has been recognized and reported  net of income tax of  as a separate component of shareholders equity 
at december  and  all of the company s securities were classified as available for sale 
decisions to purchase or sell these securities are made within the framework of the company s investment policy and are based on economic conditions including changes in interest rates  liquidity  and asset liability management strategies

the company does not actively solicit brokered deposits 
in addition to deposits  the company s sources of funds are primarily borrowings from the fhlbny  loan and investment security repayments and cash flow generated from operations including interest payments on loans and investment securities and fees 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the company offers a variety of deposit accounts having a range of interest rates and terms 
the company presently offers passbook accounts  demand deposit accounts  now accounts  money market accounts  fixed interest rate certificates of deposit with varying maturities and individual retirement accounts ira s 
the company emphasizes retention of its core deposits  as management believes that these deposits are a much more stable source of funds and are less sensitive to changes in the market level of interest rates 
however  depending on its funding needs  interest rate risk management and other considerations  the company may from time to time emphasize the origination of certificates of deposit 
at december  and  the percentage of core deposits to total deposits was and  respectively 
at december   deposits were million compared to million at december   a decrease of million 
during  the company s strategy was  and continues to be  to not match the competitions aggressive interest rates unless the company believes that relationships with deposit holders who have other deposit or loan relationships are in jeopardy 
as a result  higher costing certificates of deposit  through controlled runoff  decreased from million at december to million at december  also during  through the company s continuing cross selling efforts  marketing strategy and development of new customer relationships  core deposits grew from million at december  to million at december  the majority of the core deposit growth during was in non interest bearing deposit accounts which increased million  or 
this increase resulted primarily from new commercial and municipality relationships 
during calendar year  million of the company s certificates of deposit will be maturing 
certificates currently carry interest rates ranging from to and a weighted average interest rate of 
as of december   the company s current interest rates offered  for certificates with similar maturities  were between and 
management does not believe that the maturity of these time deposits will have a material impact to the company s liquidity 
liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity is a measure of its ability to fund loans  withdrawals of deposits and repay maturing borrowed funds in a cost effective manner 
the company s primary financing sources are deposits obtained in its own market area  advances from the fhlbny and securities sold under repurchase agreements 
other sources of funds include scheduled amortization and prepayments of loan principal and mortgage backed securities  maturities of debt securities and funds provided by operations 
at december   the company had total liquid assets consisting of cash and amounts due from banks  federal funds sold  debt  equity and mortgage backed securities  having final maturities within one year  and accrued interest from debt and mortgage backed securities  which represented of total assets and of total deposits at december  at december  the company had available to it million under a line of credit with the fhlbny  expiring october  and approximately million of excess collateral pledged with the fhlbny 
in addition  the company has approximately million in unpledged debt  equity and mortgage backed securities which could be used to collateralize additional borrowings 
finally  all of the company s securities are available for sale 
at december   capital resources were sufficient to meet outstanding loan commitments of million  commitments on unused lines of credit of million and commercial letters of credit of million 
certificates of deposit which are scheduled to mature in one year or less from december  totaled million 
management is unable to predict the amount of such deposits that will renew with the company 
as a result of the company s liquidity position  management does not believe the company s operations will be materially affected by a failure to renew these deposits 
however  experience indicates that a significant portion of such deposits should remain with the company 
in addition to million of funds provided from operating activities  the company s current year principal funding needs were primarily provided by net increases on advances from the fhlbny of million  and net proceeds received on debt securities of million 
during  cash provided was principally used for investing and financing activities 
purchases of mortgage backed securities  net of repayments and sales  totaled million and origination and purchase of loans exceeded principal collections by million 
in addition  funds used for financing activities included decreases in deposits  principally to liquidate high costing certificates of deposit  purchase and retirement of the company s common stock  and for dividend payments 
during the year ended december   the principal requirement for funds was for lending activities 
purchase and originations of loans exceeded principal collections by million 
the principal sources of funding for lending were increases in borrowings from the fhlbny  net of repayments of million  an excess of principal repayments  maturities  calls and sales of mortgage backed securities and debt and equity securities over purchases of mortgage backed securities of million and an increase in deposits of million 
liquidity management is an important function and component of managements strategy 
it allows the company to support asset growth while satisfying the borrowing need and deposit withdrawal requirements of customers 
as interest rates increase or decrease based on the economic environment  management determines the company s anticipated funding requirements and the best source and duration of funding available 
interest rate market conditions determine the duration and level of borrowed funds the company will use to leverage its excess capital 
purchases of mortgage backed securities continued to increase through  as the company sought to further balance and replace lower yielding mortgage backed and debt securities sold during the third and fourth quarter of with higher yielding intermediate term mortgage backed securities 
these purchases along with loan growth during were funded with borrowings from the fhlbny 
during  the company increased and extended the term of its borrowings 
of the outstanding borrowed funds at december   million mature overnight and the balance has final maturity dates ranging from july to september all have earlier call options at the lender s discretion 
borrowings of million with interest rates ranging from to are first callable in  and borrowings of million with interest rates of are first callable in november results of operations for the years ended december  and general 
net income for the year ended december   was million  or per share basic and diluted  as compared to million for the year december  
includes a pre tax charge of  representing the company s portion of a one time industry wide assessment on thrift institutions to recapitalize the saif 
the assessment reduced net income by  or per share  basic and assuming dilution 
exclusive of the saif assessment  the net income of the company for was million  or per share basic and assuming dilution  which is an increase of million over net income 
this increase is primarily the result of increased loans and investments  which the company has made since september  that has lead to higher net interest income  partially offset by increased non interest expense incurred to position the company for the growth which it has experienced 
net interest income 
net interest income of million for increased million  or  from million in this increase is the result of an increase in interest income larger than the increase in interest expense 
interest income 
interest income of million was up million  or  in over interest income of million 
the increase reflects a rise in average interest earning assets during compared to  as a result of asset investments funded by the proceeds of the company s initial public offering at the end of september  increased borrowing during from the fhlbny  and increased core deposits during the average balance of total interest earning assets for increased million to million from million during  principally from growth in first mortgage lending and from fourth quarter investments in mortgage backed securities 
during  as part of its strategy to grow and diversify its assets  the company increased its net loan portfolio including non residential mortgages and commercial loans  which increased to million at december  compared to million at december  in addition  during a full year s income was earned from investments made during the fourth quarter 
the company s mortgage lending in was at market rates which were less than those imbedded in its prior year s average balances 
this was largely offset by redeployment of proceeds from sales of lower yielding securities into higher yielding assets 
the combined effect of these factors upon average yields for was a reduction of basis points to from in the decrease in the actual balance of interest earning assets at december  as compared to the average balance reflects the sale during the latter part of of mortgage backed securities and debt securities  which were all held as available for sale 
the proceeds were used to repay borrowings and to fund growth in the company s net loan portfolio 
the increase in average yield on the balance sheet for december  over the average yield for the full year reflects the change in the mix of the interest earning assets which occurred during the latter part of this increased the yield on interest earning assets by basis points to at december  as compared to for the year ended interest expense 
interest expense increased by million  or  during compared to the previous year 
of this  interest expense on borrowed funds increased million and interest expense on deposits increased million 
the increase in interest expense on borrowed funds was due to a significant increase in the average balance of outstanding borrowings at average rates substantially lower than those of the prior year  and the increase in interest expense on deposits results from more core deposits in than  at slightly higher rates 
the average balance of borrowed funds during increased million  or  to million as compared to the same period for this increase in borrowings reflects implementation of the company s strategy to leverage its excess capital 
these borrowings  along with increased deposits and the capital provided through the company s initial public offering  have funded the increase in assets which has occurred since september the weighted average borrowing cost decreased during by basis points from in to in the decrease reflects the company s decision in december to repay million of higher cost  longer term borrowings and replace it with short term  lower cost to day borrowings 
the company maintained that duration with all of its borrowings until december when it replaced million of its short term borrowings with a five year  borrowing from the fhlbny  which is callable after three years 
at december   the company s remaining short term borrowings were million  which mature within days 
the average balance of interest bearing deposits increased million  or  to million for from million in also  the average cost of interest bearing deposits grew to during as compared to for the previous year 
this cost increase primarily reflects the full period s effect of changes in the company s costs of certificates of deposit made when the company began  in late  to market cd s with competitive rates  generally for terms of less than months in conjunction with advertising campaigns geared toward re emphasizing the company s presence in its markets 
although these rates were not the highest in the company s market territory  they were higher than those it traditionally offered 
it continued with these rate offerings when the company opened new branches in june and december of and march and october of in addition  interest rates on savings accounts have increased as a result of paying bonuses on statement savings accounts  on a limited basis  to customers of those new branches 
also  during mid third quarter of  the company started to market its products  including deposits to affinity groups 
under this program  the company offers higher savings rates which are tied to the three month us treasury rate 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses increased  to  for the year ended december  from  for the prior year 
the provision for was determined by management after review of  among other things  the company s loan portfolio  the risks inherent in the company s lending activities and the local economy in the company s market areas 
as of december   non performing loans  defined as non accrual loans and accruing loans delinquent days or more  decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  compared to million at december   a decrease of million  or 
despite this decrease  the percentage of the allowance for loan losses to total non performing loans increased to at december  from at december  because million of a million non performing construction loan was repaid during the remaining balance on this loan of  was charged against a specific reserve of million which had previously been established for this loan 
after the charge off  the remaining balance of the specific reserve was allocated within the allowance for loan losses to other classes of loans 
non interest income 
non interest income decreased million to million for compared to million for the principal reason was the loss of million on the sale of securities during as compared to a loss of  on the sale of securities for the securities sold in had an approximate book value of million 
proceeds from the sales  in conjunction with additional borrowings and deposits  were used to fund loan growth and for redeployment into higher yielding securities 
the effect of this loss was to reduce earnings per share by  basic and assuming dilution 
aside from the effect of the above described securities transactions  includes  from the collection of unaccrued interest associated with loans  the principal of which has been repaid  as compared to  in collections for the same period of the prior year 
the interest on all of these loans has been completely repaid 
the effect of this non recurring income to earnings per share was  basic and assuming dilution 
absent the above mentioned losses and credits  non interest income decreased  during as compared to the same period of the prior year 
this decrease occurred in the first quarter of  primarily due to decreases in commissions from annuity sales as the company focused its resources on developing its new branches and marketing its core products rather than selling annuities 
non interest expense 
non interest expense totaled million for  an increase of million  or  as compared to million incurred during the prior year 
exclusive of the saif assessment  total non interest expense increased million  or  to million for from million in salaries and employee benefits expenses for increased million  or  compared to the prior year 
of this amount  approximately million was related to increased staffing requirements necessary to position the company to achieve its marketing and operational objectives  including increased executive and loan administrative staff  and staffing and training for the company s three new branches opened during the period since december other salary and benefit expenses  incurred for the same reason  include provisions for additional incentive programs for employees at all levels of the company  including million associated with the company s esop established september  and million associated with the employee rrp adopted midway through finally  salary and benefit expenses also reflect normal salary increases from salary in place during the same period of the prior year 
occupancy costs increased million  or  to million for from million for the increase is principally the result of new lease costs for the three new branches the company has opened since the quarter ended december  and the related amortization of leasehold improvements to these branches as well as refurbishment of existing facilities 
data processing expense increased million  or  to million for compared to million for the prior year 
this increase reflects additional costs as the company upgraded its operating system and all of its applications to provide more capability for services to its customers base 
foreclosed real estate expense  net decreased million  or  to million from million for the primary reason for this decrease was lower real estate tax  insurance  maintenance and repair expenses associated with foreclosed properties as compared to the prior year 
other non interest expense increased million  or  to million compared to million for the prior year  principally due to advertising and promotional expenses in conjunction with the growth of core deposits and the promotions associated with loan growth and new branches 
income tax expense 
income taxes for reflect the tax effect of the pre tax income recognized for  partially offset by a reversal of a  tax liability  previously established  which expired during the effect of this reversal was to increase earnings per share  basic and assuming dilution for income tax expense for is solely the result of the tax effect of the pre tax income recognized in that period 
impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in relative purchasing power over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than does the effect of inflation 
market risk the company s operations may be subject to a variety of market risks  the most material of which is the risk of changing interest rates 
most generally  interest rate risk irr is the volatility in financial performance  attributable to changes in market interest rates  which may result in either fluctuation of net interest income or changes to the economic value of the equity of the company 
the principal objective of the company s irr management activities is to provide maximum levels of net interest income while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk and facilitating the funding needs of the company 
consistent with its definition of irr  the company measures earnings at risk and value at risk 
to measure earnings at risk  the company utilizes an income simulation model which starts with a detailed inventory of balance sheet items and factors in the probability of the maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities  including assumed prepayment risks 
simulation of net interest income takes into account the relative sensitivities of these balance sheet items to dynamic rates and projects their behavior over an extended period of time 
simulation analysis of net interest income reflects both the possibility and probability of the behavior of balance sheet items 
in addition to simulating net interest income to measure earnings at risk  the company also measures irr from the perspective of value at risk 
such analysis is the measurement and management of irr from the longer term perspective of the economic value of the equity of the company 
this is performed through net portfolio value npv analysis which is intended to address the changes in equity value arising from movements in interest rates 
the npv analysis first reprices all of the assets and liabilities under the current interest rate environment  then compares this result to repricing under a changed interest rate environment  thus evaluating the impact of immediate and sustained interest rate shifts across the current interest rate yield curve on the market value of the current balance sheet 
a significant limitation inherent in npv analysis is that it is static 
consequently  there is no recognition of the potential for strategy adjustments in a volatile rate environment which would protect or conserve equity values 
changes in the estimates and assumptions made for irr analysis could have a significant impact on projected results and conclusions 
these analyses involve a variety of significant estimates and assumptions  including  among others estimates concerning assets and liabilities without definite maturities or repricing characteristics  how and when yields on interest earning assets and costs of interest bearing liabilities will change in response to movement of market interest rates  prepayment speeds  future cash flows  and discount rates 
therefore  these techniques may not accurately reflect the impact of general market interest rate movements on the company s net interest income or the value of its economic equity 
the table below sets forth the assumed change to the company s estimated net portfolio value at december   based upon an immediate and sustained interest rate change from the interest rate yield curve at december  of plus and basis points and minus and basis points

in addition to these tools  alco s review includes the book and market value of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses  market conditions and interest rates  and cash flow needs with regard to investment activity  including loans  and deposit flow 
year management of the company has reviewed the company s status regarding year computer issues 
failure of the company to adequately address any year deficiencies in the company s computer operations could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations in future periods 
the company s deposit and loan account transactions and applications are processed offsite by a third party 
based upon interface with these deposit and loan application systems  the company internally generates deposit and loan transactions  and processes its general ledger and several other systems on its resident hardware 
a significant amount of the company s computer hardware has been purchased since july and is year compliant 
in addition  management believes that it is taking all necessary steps to ensure year compliance  and its vendor has committed to being year compliant prior to year end  thereby leaving sufficient time for testing all applications  both internally and externally processed  prior to year end management believes that the cost to be incurred for year compliance  both with regard to the company s internal and outsourced data processing operations  will not be material 
in addition  management believes the company to be in compliance with all bank regulatory requirements regarding year
