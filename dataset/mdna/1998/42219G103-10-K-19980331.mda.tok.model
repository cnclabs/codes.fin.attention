health care services health power hmo overview of managed health care hmos generally arrange for the provision of comprehensive health care services  including physician and hospital care  to their members for a fixed  prepaid premium regardless of frequency  extent  or type of the health care services provided 
except in cases of medical emergency  the members receive care from participating primary care physicians who provide all of the primary care services and coordinate services with participating specialists and hospitals 
hmos are frequently able to negotiate favorable rates with providers due to their large membership base and to control medical expenses to a greater extent than traditional health insurers 
typically  hmos seek to enter into arrangements with hospitals calling for discounted charges or fixed per diem rates and with physicians for fixed monthly payments  regardless of the amount of health care services which are actually required  known as capitation payments  or seek to contract with medical providers on a discounted fee for service basis 
hmos seek to combine quality health care with management controls designed to encourage efficient and economical utilization of health care services 
such controls include monitoring physician services  the level of hospital care and lengths of stay  emergency room use  and the effective use of hospital based medical services 
hmos generally receive fixed monthly premiums for their members regardless of the health care services provided 
thus  hmos have an incentive to maintain the health of their members through preventive medical programs while carefully monitoring expenses through the implementation of various cost control strategies and effective management 
the three basic hmo organizational models are primarily distinguishable by the relationship of the hmo with its physician network 
staff model hmos employ physicians directly at hmo controlled facilities and compensate each physician through salary and incentives 
network model hmos  such as health power hmo  contract with a limited number of physician groups to provide health care services to each member on a capitated or a discounted fee for service basis 
individual practice association model hmos contract with individual physicians  either directly or through a physicians association  and each physician is typically compensated on a capitated or a discounted fee for service basis 
hmos may be contrasted with indemnity health insurers  which generally provide reimbursement under a fee for service system in which the charges of physicians  hospitals  and other providers selected by the insured are in direct proportion to the quantity and complexity of the services provided 
hmos also rely to a lesser extent on member cost sharing or copayment features that are more characteristic of traditional indemnity insurance 
preferred provider organizations ppos are similar to indemnity plans but typically feature discounted fee for service charges by selected providers and financial incentives for members to use providers within the ppo system 
membership and markets medicaid membership health power hmo offers health care services to medicaid recipients enrolled in the owf program in the six ohio counties of butler  cuyahoga  franklin  hamilton  mahoning  and montgomery

in these counties  medicaid recipients either select health power hmo from among several managed care plans offered to them or  if no selection is made  they are assigned to a plan by odhs 
in mahoning county  which is a non mandated or voluntary county  medicaid recipients join health power hmo as an alternative to the traditional fee for service medicaid program in which recipients receive a medicaid medical card that enables them to receive medical services performed by participating providers 
medicaid recipients in voluntary counties may change the managed care plan selected by them or the method in which they receive medical benefits ie  fee for service or managed care on a monthly basis 
medicaid recipients in mandated counties may change managed care plans only during the first month of enrollment or during two open enrollment months during the year 
as previously described  health power hmo has entered into agreements to sell the contract rights for its medicaid membership in cuyahoga and mahoning counties to emerald hmo  inc and total health care plan  inc  respectively  and to transfer the contract rights for its butler county medicaid membership to medical mutual in exchange for medical mutual s contract rights for that entity s montgomery county medicaid membership

these services include primary care physician  specialist  and hospital care  dental care  physical therapy  mental health and chemical dependency care  eye care  home health care  skilled nursing care  pharmacy  diagnostic laboratory tests  x ray examinations  ambulance services  and durable medical equipment 
medicaid recipients do not pay any premiums  deductibles  or copayments for any of their health care services 
health power hmo assumes the risk that the actual cost of health care services may exceed the monthly capitation fee received from the state of ohio 
commercial commercial members or their employers can select coverages available from products which have varying levels of outpatient and inpatient copayments and deductibles 
health power hmo has a variety of plans available ranging from basic plan  which provides basic health care coverages at a low monthly cost but with higher deductibles  to a high plan which provides more comprehensive coverage at a higher monthly cost but with lower deductibles 
providers health power hmo provides health care to its members through a provider network consisting of primary care physicians  specialists  and hospitals 
the following table sets forth the total number of primary care physicians  specialists  and hospitals in each of health power hmo s service areas as of december  service area columbus dayton cincinnati northeast total primary care physicians  specialists     hospitals upon enrollment  each member selects a primary care physician from the list of physicians in health power hmo s physician network 
primary care physicians include family practitioners  pediatricians  and internists 
primary care physicians coordinate the health care requirements of the members  assume overall responsibility for the care of members  and coordinate the nature and extent of services provided to any member 
these physicians provide preventive and routine health care services and are responsible for making referrals to specialists  hospitals  and other providers 
health care services provided directly by the primary care physicians include the treatment of illnesses not requiring referrals  periodic physician examinations  routine immunizations  maternity and well child care  and other preventive health care services 
specialists provide medical care to members when referred by the primary care physician 
certain specialist services  such as outpatient laboratory tests and x ray examinations and self referrals for obstetrics  do not require a referral 
the physician network and provider satisfaction are critical to the successful functioning of an hmo 
management believes that the number of primary care physicians and sites enhances the marketability of its health care program 
health power hmo devotes significant resources to recruiting  credentialing  and educating physicians and their staffs 
furthermore  health power hmo operates plans that integrate the physician into the decision making process through a structure of standing and ad hoc committees 
the provider services department is responsible for responding directly with physicians and their staff concerning administrative inquiries to supplement the on site provider relations program 
health power hmo has established a continual quality improvement committee composed of physicians in each service area to work with physicians in monitoring and developing medical policies 
the councils are supported by the provider relations staff through the health services department 
health power hmo has contracted with other entities to provide  among other things  dental care  physical therapy  mental health and chemical dependency care  eye care  home health care  skilled nursing care  diagnostic laboratory tests  x ray examinations  ambulance services  a hour nurse line  and durable medical equipment to its hmo members 
members of the hmo have access to approximately pharmacies in its four service areas and approximately  pharmacies throughout the united states pursuant to an agreement with valuerx pharmacy program  inc medical cost controls health power hmo uses a number of methods and procedures to control and manage medical costs 
these include capitation and other fee arrangements with providers  concurrent and utilization review of inpatient hospital services  including advance approval procedures for elective hospital admissions  and underwriting procedures 
capitation arrangements as of december   approximately of health power hmo s members were covered by primary care physicians who were capitated 
capitation is a method of compensation to providers in which payments by the hmo for health care services are based on a fixed monthly amount for each person served by such providers regardless of the actual number or nature of services provided 
the primary benefits of the capitation system of payment are that it improves the forecasting of medical expenses and introduces an element of risk sharing between the hmo and the primary care physicians who are responsible for coordinating care with specialists  hospitals  and for other ancillary services 
health power hmo s arrangements with other providers for dental  mental health and chemical dependency  and eye care services are also capitated 
during the first half of  health power hmo prepared an analysis of the risk transfer elements contained in certain medicaid capitated provider contracts 
in order to reduce the amount of risk transferred to the primary care physicians in the contracts  health power hmo eliminate both the withhold and incentive fund provisions included in such contracts 
the effective date for this change was july  commercial capitated provider contracts continue to include provisions for withholds ranging from to of the capitated payments due such providers as a reserve for potential excess utilization and incentive funds designed to encourage appropriate utilization 
the balances in these incentive fund accounts are retained by health power hmo or remitted to the primary care physicians at the end of the year based upon the performance of the combined physician groups for such year 
for  all such amounts were retained by health power hmo 
health power hmo annually reviews the capitation fee paid to primary care physicians and makes adjustments as necessary 
among the factors considered in capitation adjustments are utilization patterns and competitive market conditions 
other fee arrangements health power hmo presently reimburses primary care physicians representing approximately of the hmo s total membership on an agreed upon fee schedule 
despite the success of its capitation program  health power hmo has concluded that a significant number of primary care physicians prefer the fee schedule arrangement over capitation payments  and in order to attract more primary care physicians to its provider network  health power hmo offers fee schedule arrangements 
consistent with its capitation arrangements  health power hmo may withhold a portion of such fees to cover payments for fees to specialists and hospital costs in excess of such physician s budgeted amounts 
health power hmo s primary care physicians coordinate care for members with specialists participating in health power hmo s network 
health power hmo s provider arrangements with specialists provide for payment for commercial services at fixed rates 
specialists services to medicaid members are paid at rates established by odhs 
in order to encourage cost effective utilization of specialists services  amounts paid to specialists in the aggregate that are in excess of budgeted amounts may be deducted from such primary care physician s capitation withhold commercial members 
for medicaid members  specialist payments for most capitated primary care providers are included in their monthly capitation payment 
with the exception of emergencies  all inpatient hospital services paid by health power hmo on behalf of the physicians are provided pursuant to contracts with various hospitals under a variety of arrangements  including discounted charges and per diem arrangements  and require advance approval from the patient s primary care physician and health power hmo s medical department 
emergencies which require medical care by physicians or hospitals not under contract with health power hmo are paid by health power hmo 
in order to encourage cost effective utilization of hospital services for its commercial providers  if the aggregate amount of hospital costs exceed budgeted amounts  the excess attributable to a particular primary care physician may be deducted from such physician s capitation withhold 
in order to obtain high quality services at cost effective rates  health power hmo has contracted with other providers for  among other things  physical therapy  home health care  skilled nursing care  pharmacy  diagnostic laboratory tests  x ray examinations  ambulance services  and durable medical equipment 
utilization review health power hmo believes that its ability to effectively manage the appropriateness of services in the most cost effective setting is a key component of its operations 
health power hmo seeks to manage medical costs by monitoring for inappropriate services 
in addition to approval by a member s primary care physician  all elective hospital admissions must be approved in advance by health power hmo s utilization management department 
when members are admitted to a hospital  health power hmo proactively and concurrently reviews all hospital admissions and coordinates with the admitting physician the medical necessity and appropriateness of hospital procedures and length of stay 
health power hmo also coordinates arrangements for alternative care for members as they progress through the continuum of care 
health power hmo conducts retrospective review of patient records after services are complete to determine appropriateness of hospital services and charges 
underwriting health power hmo s commercial underwriting practices are designed to provide appropriate premium rates and benefits for employer groups 
health power hmo also monitors actual experience with each employer group and attempts to make appropriate premium rate adjustments when contracts are renewed with the employer 
with respect to commercial members  health power hmo establishes premiums primarily pursuant to a community rating system by class which generally means that it charges the same amount of premium per member within a geographic area actuarially modified for each employer group based upon the age and sex of its employees 
in order to assure appropriately balanced risk selection  management has developed underwriting criteria which establish minimum requirements for each employer group to meet before qualifying for coverage with health power hmo and tailors the benefit coverage to each employer group 
since  health power hmo has utilized the services of an independent actuary to assist it in establishing its membership premiums for commercial members and appropriate reserves for medical claims incurred but not yet reported to health power hmo 
because of its contractual arrangement with odhs which requires health power hmo to provide health care services to any medicaid recipient who selects its hmo  traditional underwriting guidelines do not apply to the medicaid program 
marketing in mandatory counties such as butler  cuyahoga  franklin  hamilton  and montgomery  health power hmo and all other managed care plans are prohibited from directly marketing to potential enrollees 
instead  potential enrollees contact or visit enrollment information centers eics located in a mandatory county 
eic staff members review with enrollees information about each plan s performance ie  consumer satisfaction surveys  provider network  and any plan specific advantages 
enrollees are also able to view a video about health power hmo and the other managed care plans operating in the mandatory county 
in voluntary counties such as mahoning  health power hmo may and does directly market to potential enrollees 
health power hmo markets its hmo directly to recipients through a variety of methods  all of which require prior approval of odhs 
health power hmo markets its programs to medicaid recipients as an alternative to the traditional fee for service medicaid program in which recipients receive a medicaid medical card that enables them to receive medical services performed by participating physicians  hospitals  and other health care providers 
because medicaid recipients may change the method of receiving medical benefits on a monthly basis  health power hmo s representatives are responsible for monitoring member satisfaction after initial enrollment 
unless a member loses medicaid eligibility or chooses to disenroll  medicaid members are automatically renewed in health power hmo s program on a monthly basis 
health power hmo s commercial programs are marketed through a combination of its own sales force and independent agents and brokers 
health power hmo markets its plans to private employers as well as to public employer groups 
employers who offer health power s hmo to their employees generally do so as an option to traditional coverage rather than as a required replacement 
therefore  marketing health power s hmo commercial programs requires a two part sale 
the employer must first decide to offer health power s hmo 
the employee then chooses among health power s hmo  traditional health care insurance  and other options  including other hmos 
each year employers conduct an open enrollment during which their employees may change health care plans 
health power hmo utilizes various techniques to retain members and to attract additional members during open enrollment periods  including work site presentations  direct mail  and local advertising 
health power hmo has a member services department which directly communicates with members concerning their health care and service needs 
health power hmo conducts statistically valid annual surveys questioning members about their level of satisfaction with the services they receive and satisfaction with primary care physicians 
health power hmo has also established member advisory groups in each of its service areas  composed of members selected at random  to provide information to health power hmo concerning services to members 
management reviews any problems that are presented by members concerning the delivery of medical care and receives periodic reports summarizing member grievances 
quality improvement health power has developed policies and procedures to ensure that the health care services provided by its hmo meet the professional standards of care established by the medical community 
health power hmo has a one year ncqa accreditation which expires march  ncqa accreditation is granted to hmos which are found to have comprehensive functioning continual quality improvement programs and which satisfy all ncqa standards for accreditation 
health power hmo s methods for evaluating the quality and appropriateness of medical care include performing periodic medical care evaluation studies  analyzing the monthly utilization of certain services  conducting periodic member satisfaction studies and reviewing and responding to member and physician grievances 
health power hmo also compiles statistical information and publishes monthly departmental summary reports concerning the utilization of various services  including emergency room care  member service activity  provider service activity  claims related volume  outpatient care  out of area services  hospital services and physician visits 
under utilization as well as over utilization are evaluated in an effort to control the provision of quality care to health power hmo s members 
as part of its continual quality improvement program  health power hmo has established peer review procedures which are carried out by a quality improvement committee consisting of members of the physician groups in each service area 
this committee reviews and evaluates the quality of health care delivered by the physician groups and study the various tests and procedures performed by physicians for specific diagnoses 
health power hmo also reviews the effectiveness of the physician group continual quality improvement committee on a periodic basis 
in addition  when a new physician group applies to become a provider  health power hmo has a thorough credentialing procedure 
health power hmo evaluates the quality of the group s medical facility  medical records  laboratory and x ray facilities and capacity to handle membership demands  performs an on site inspection  and reviews malpractice complaints and relations with area hospitals 
once a physician group is selected  it is periodically reviewed in an attempt to ensure that members are receiving quality medical care and appropriate access 
risk management and insurance health power hmo has reinsurance to limit its risks for hospital costs with respect to its medicaid members 
this reinsurance provides that during each month period  the reinsurer will pay of hospital costs for each medicaid member above a stop loss attachment amount of  health power hmo also has reinsurance to limit its risks for commercial members hospital costs exceeding certain amounts 
the percentage of the hospital costs paid by reinsurance depends on whether the hospital has a provider agreement with health power hmo which provides for fixed charges for members for specified services a fixed fee hospital  the type of services provided and the age of the member 
health power hmo s commercial reinsurance arrangements provide  during each month period  for coverage of the excess loss on hospital costs according to the following table fixed fee other type of service hospital hospital organ and bone marrow transplant therapy all other services when member is under one year of age all other services when member is over one year of age the excess loss on hospital costs is calculated by subtracting the deductible  currently  to be paid by health power hmo from the eligible hospital services 
eligible hospital services are limited to the average daily maximum set forth below per member  which limitation does not include operating room charges or post operative charges on the day of a surgical procedure  and which are further limited to a maximum reinsurance amount 
there is a risk that  because of this average daily maximum limitation  health power hmo could be responsible for hospital costs in excess of the  deductible 
daily maximum to days  to days  days and beyond  the maximum lifetime reinsurance indemnity for each member is  in addition  health power hmo has various types of liability insurance to limit the ordinary risks of being engaged in the hmo business 
health power hmo requires each of its physician groups and contracting hospitals to have medical malpractice insurance 
additionally  health power hmo carries its own medical malpractice insurance 
in the ordinary course of its business  health power hmo may be subject to claims for which it may not be fully insured  such as claims resulting from decisions regarding providers  claims resulting from decisions regarding medical circumstances or necessity of treatment  including failure to approve medical procedures or hospital admissions  claims against health power hmo for malpractice by providers in its network  claims for failure to provide coverage or for wrongful termination of coverage  claims resulting from other issues with employer groups  members  or providers  and other general liability claims 
there is a risk that claims could exceed or not be covered by insurance 
competition the health care industry is highly competitive 
health power hmo faces substantial competition in each of its service areas from many types of competitors  including other for profit and not for profit hmos  ppos  self funded plans  and traditional indemnity insurance carriers  many of which have substantially larger enrollments and greater financial and other resources than health power hmo 
health power hmo believes that the principal competitive factors affecting its ability to retain and increase membership include its provider network  the cost of health benefit plans offered  geographic areas served  reputation  financial stability  quality of staff  comprehensiveness of benefit coverage  diversity of product offerings  and market presence 
the relative importance of each of these factors and health power hmo s key competitors vary by customer type and by market 
in addition  a number of health power hmo s competitors offer diverse products  many of which are similar to those that health power hmo is currently offering or may be offering in the future 
furthermore  premium rates charged by health power hmo s competitors may have an impact on health power hmo s ability to grow and to maintain profitability 
the market for hmo and managed care products has been subject to historical changes in profitability resulting from increases in health care costs during periods when significant competition or other market factors prevent corresponding increases in premiums 
during  hmos generally began raising commercial premium rates on response to lower profit margins 
health power hmo will face varying levels of established competition if it enters new markets or introduces new programs  products  and services 
in addition  new competitors may compete with health power hmo in the future 
health power hmo also competes with other managed care plans to enter into contracts with independent physicians  physician groups and other providers 
competitive factors influencing a physician s or other provider s decision to contract with health power hmo include potential membership volume  reimbursement rates  timeliness of reimbursement and administrative service capabilities

in addition  every hic must maintain a certain minimum total admitted assets in ohio  with only certain assets and liabilities of the hic considered in calculating such minimum total admitted assets 
as of december   ohio law required hics to maintain statutory net worth in an amount such that admitted assets were equal to at least of liabilities  but in no event less than  for ohio hics providing both basic and supplemental health care services

federally qualified hmos health power hmo is not a federally qualified hmo 
at the present time  health power s management has determined that the effort and expense of obtaining federal qualification outweigh the benefits  as described below  of becoming a federally qualified hmo 
federally qualified hmos must file periodic financial disclosure reports with  and are subject to continuous oversight and periodic review by  the united states department of health and human services and the united states health care financing administration hcfa 
subject to certain exceptions  federally qualified hmos are required to set their premiums according to principles of community rating and to offer a minimum level of benefits which typically exceeds the level of benefits required by state regulation 
historically  the primary benefits of obtaining federal qualification were that it enabled an hmo to offer health care services to medicare recipients and to be exempt from federal and possibly state enrollment mix requirements 
however  non federally qualified hmos are now permitted to offer health care services to medicare recipients 
health power s management periodically reviews whether or not federal qualification would yield tangible benefits that would make the effort and expense of obtaining federal qualification worthwhile to the company 
federal regulation of physician incentive plans under federal regulations effective on january   hmos participating in the medicare and medicaid programs must comply with certain restrictions and reporting requirements mandated in connection with risk sharing arrangements  or physician incentive plans  between hmos and physicians 
the regulations specify that an hmo may operate a physician incentive plan only if no payment is made  directly or indirectly  to a physician or physician group as an inducement to reduce or limit medically necessary services furnished to an individual enrollee and only if certain stop loss protection and disclosure requirements are met 
where a physician incentive plan under a capitated payment arrangement places the physician or physician group at risk for the cost of use or referral of services that exceeds a threshold of of the total potential payment received by the physicians from the hmo  the physicians are deemed to be at substantial financial risk 
hmos that place physicians at substantial financial risk must conduct annual enrollee disenrollee surveys addressing satisfaction with the quality of services provided and degrees of access to services 
in addition  hmos must ensure that all physicians and physician groups which are at substantial financial risk have either aggregate or per patient stop loss protection eg  insurance covering of the costs of referral services that exceed of the potential payments to the physicians under the physician incentive plan 
each hmo with physician incentive plans must provide to hcfa  at the time of application for a contract  annually and upon request  information concerning its physician incentive plans 
medicare medicaid beneficiaries may also request information from an hmo pertaining to its physician incentive plans 
health insurance portability and accountability act of the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa established  among other things  minimum federal standards for private health insurers 
hipaa creates standards for guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewability of health insurance coverage  maximum pre existing condition exclusions  credit against those exclusions for prior creditable coverage ie  portability  premium limitations  and disclosure 
in response to the federally mandated standards  the ohio general assembly enacted house bill  effective june   which establishes the state s minimum standards intended to comply with the requirements of hipaa 
under ohio s enactment of the hipaa standards  for hics providing benefits to small or large employer groups  the maximum exclusion period for enrollees with pre existing conditions is limited to months months for late enrollees 
the pre existing condition exclusion does not apply to maternity benefits  as pregnancy is prohibited from being considered a pre existing condition 
further  as part of the federal standards emphasis on portability  ohio s new law generally requires that a pre existing condition exclusion period be reduced by the aggregate of the periods of continuous creditable coverage immediately prior to enrollment  if any  applicable to the enrollee as of the enrollment date 
creditable coverage includes a group health plan  health insurance  medicare or medicaid  state health benefits risk pool  or public health plan 
the foregoing provisions do not apply  however  to insurance policies and hic contracts issued to groups other than large or small employer groups 
ohio s new law also provides for guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewability of health insurance benefits under certain situations 
if an hic offers coverage in the small or large group employer market  or individual market  in connection with a contract or policy  the hic must continue or renew such coverage at the request of the plan sponsor or contract holder  subject to certain exceptions  including fraud  intentional misrepresentation and failure to pay premiums 
an hic may cancel coverage for a particular enrollee  employee  or dependent for fraud or intentional misrepresentation  provided that the cancellation not based on any health status related factor 
the ohio law also requires hics to make available to every small employer that applies for coverage every health benefit plan that it is actively marketing to small employers  subject to certain exceptions and to rules to be adopted by the superintendent of insurance 
ohio s enactment of the hipaa standards also includes provisions requiring insurers and hics providing coverage to small or large employer groups to disclose provisions relating to the issuer s right to change premium or periodic prepayment rates  renewability of coverage  pre existing condition exclusions and the benefits and rates available under all contracts for which the employer is qualified 
this information must be identified in all marketing and sales materials as being available upon request 
hics and other insurers are also prohibited under the new law from requiring  as a condition of coverage or of continued coverage  that an individual pay higher premiums when compared to a similarly situated individual covered under the contract or policy  on the basis of a health status related factor 
the new law also modifies the open enrollment periods previously required of hics and sickness and accident insurers 
ohio s enactment of the hipaa standards eliminates the former open enrollment periods for small employer groups  in favor of the new guaranteed issue provisions under the new law 
individuals who are not federally eligible individuals may continue to apply for open enrollment coverage under the former law 
federally eligible individuals defined as eligible individuals under rules adopted by hhs consist of individuals who generally have at least months of prior creditable coverage under a group health plan  are not eligible for medicare or medicaid  have no other insurance coverage any cobra continuation has been elected and expired  and whose prior coverage was not terminated because of nonpayment of premiums  or fraud 
hics are required under ohio s new law to establish an open enrollment period in january of each year for federally eligible individuals  extending until of the hic s total number of insureds are new insureds 
certain other requirements exist  including a provision enabling an hic to deny coverage upon demonstrating that the hic will not have the capacity to deliver services adequately because of existing obligations to group and individual contract holders 
finally  the new law modifies the conversion coverage requirements in the case of individuals who terminate employment or membership in a group 
hics and other insurers must provide an option to federally eligible individuals for conversion to a basic or standard plan established by the ohio health reinsurance program  or one substantially similar to such standard plans 
certain limitations on the maximum periodic prepayment under such plans are established under the new law 
subscribers of an hic group contract that are not federally eligible individuals may convert to a direct payment contract comparable to any of the individual contracts then being issued by the hic

medicaid is sponsored by individual state governments  such as ohio  which obtain significant financial support from the federal government in the form of matching funds 
ohio s medicaid program is supervised and regulated by odhs 
currently  only enrollees in the owf program are eligible to receive medicaid medical benefits through a participating hmo 
health power hmo participates in the owf program through a provider agreement with odhs 
odhs may enter into provider agreements for the provision of medicaid services with hics that meet odhs s definition of an hic and that comply with certain other rules 
as a participant in the owf program  health power hmo must comply with specific rules established for such participation 
these rules contain specific requirements  including eligibility  enrollment  disenrollment  covered services  eligible providers  subcontractors  recordkeeping  reporting  quality assurance  and marketing 
an hic s compliance with these requirements is subject to monitoring by odhs or its designee  the state of ohio s auditor s office  and the united states department of human services 
the process by which odhs evaluates an hic s compliance with the quality assurance standards is an annual comprehensive quality assurance evaluation by a third party reviewing organization 
the hic must also submit annual and semiannual utilization reports 
the most recent evaluations of the medicaid hic operated by health power hmo indicated that it was in compliance with odhs quality assurance standards 
hics participating in the owf program receive  as compensation for health care services provided to enrollees  a contractual periodic prepayment  or capitated fee for all enrollees 
under ohio medicaid regulations  hics participating in the owf program must file annual and quarterly cost reports with odhs 
in voluntary counties  ohio and federal regulations require hics participating in the owf medicaid program to derive  generally  at least of their membership residing in a single county  or group of contiguous counties approved as a single service area  from non medicaid recipients 
odhs has the authority to waive the state requirement for an hic on an annual basis for up to three years  provided that hcfa has also waived the federal enrollment mix requirement for such hic 
hcfa has the authority to waive the federal requirement for up to three years 
mahoning county is the only voluntary county in which health power hmo offers its services to medicaid recipients  and it currently has odhs and hcfa waivers for this county 
see also mandatory managed care counties for medicaid recipients 
mandatory managed care counties for medicaid recipients legislation adopted by the general assembly  in conjunction with a waiver of certain federal requirements granted by hcfa in  grants authority to odhs to mandate medicaid recipients enrolled in the owf program and residing in certain ohio counties to enroll in managed care plans in order to receive medical services 
pursuant to this authority  odhs has designated seven counties franklin  montgomery  hamilton  butler  cuyahoga  summit  and lucas as mandatory enrollment counties 
all medicaid recipients residing in a mandatory enrollment county must enroll with a managed care plan in order to receive medical services 
in a mandatory enrollment county  all participating hics must accept all eligible medicaid recipients desiring to enroll in such hic  without restriction  in the order in which such recipients apply to become enrollees of such hic 
enrollment opportunities must remain open and available as long as the enrollment maximums determined by odhs and found in the provider agreement with such hic are not exceeded 
because of this requirement  participating hics are not subject to the federal and state enrollment mix requirements  but instead  membership is limited as to a maximum number of enrollees by the odhs provider agreement

pursuant to its provider agreement with odhs  health power hmo was providing health care services to approximately  residents in those counties as of december   which represented over of health power hmo s membership in its northeast service area 
the aggregate sale prices for these transactions are expected to be approximately  the company plans to exit the northeast service area as soon as permissible following the completion of these transactions because of the insignificant membership remaining in that service area

the company s management believes that  barring unforeseen circumstances  the company s operating results on a consolidated basis will continue to be profitable during  primarily because of the operations of compmanagement and compmanagement health systems 
health power hmo s operating results have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the potential occurrence of various factors  such as decreases in capitation rates from odhs  increases in health care cost  decreases in the size of the medicaid population  and increases in reserve estimates 
while the company does not anticipate capitation rate reductions from odhs in  as was experienced in and  it anticipates only a slight increase in such rates to occur during the second half of however  there can be no assurance that health care costs will not increase at a rate in excess of such capitation rate increases 
furthermore  because of favorable economic conditions  ohio has experienced  and continues to experience  a decrease in the number of eligible medicaid recipients 
this decrease in the number of eligible medicaid recipients may continue to negatively impact health power hmo in finally  there can be no assurance that reserve estimates will not be subject to adjustments during based upon the foregoing factors and the company s most recent operating projections  it is uncertain at this time whether the operations of health power hmo will be profitable in compared to the company s revenues increased million  or  to million during  from million for compmanagement s revenues increased million  or  to million during  as compared to the prior year  as a result of an increase in the number of employers contracting for its services  and in particular  employers participating in group rating plans 
health power hmo s revenues increased million  or  to million during  from million for health power hmo s medicaid revenues increased during  as compared to the prior year  primarily as a result of a increase in member months which was primarily due to the enrollment of the medicaid recipients previously served by choicecare  which more than offset a decrease in the revenue per member months 
health power hmo s commercial revenues decreased during  as compared to the prior year  primarily as a result of a decrease in the revenue per member month 
the decrease in the medicaid revenue per member month resulted from the july  capitation rate reduction of approximately from odhs 
the decrease in the commercial revenue per member month was the result of a competitive and price sensitive commercial marketplace 
health power hmo s health care costs increased million  or  to million during  from million for the results included a fourth quarter adjustment in which health power hmo decreased its health care costs by approximately million to record retention of risk sharing funds previously accrued for payment to its primary care physicians 
the hmo medical loss ratio was for  as compared to for the increase in the hmo medical loss ratio was primarily due to increases in per member health care costs of and for commercial and medicaid business  respectively  during  as compared to the prior year  along with the aforementioned decrease in per member commercial revenue and the decrease in per member medicaid revenue during the same period 
the decrease in the commercial per member revenue was attributable to rate decreases based upon the competitive and price sensitive commercial marketplace during the decrease in the medicaid per member revenue was attributable to decreases in the capitation rates from odhs 
the capitation rates from odhs are fixed in advance of each year s agreement  and health power hmo is unable to adjust such rates during the contract term 
odhs bases its rates  in part  on its estimates of medicaid health care costs increases 
during  health power hmo experienced health care cost increases at rates in excess of the odhs cost estimates 
the company s sga expenses increased million  or  to million for  from million for compmanagement s sga expenses increased million  or  to million for  from million for this increase was primarily the result of expenses incurred by compmanagement health systems in connection with the development of its mco operations and increases in compmanagement s selling commissions 
health power hmo s sga expenses increased million  or  to million for  from million for this increase was primarily the result of expenses incurred in connection with obtaining ncqa accreditation and expansion into the northeast service area 
the hmo administrative ratio was for  as compared to for the improvement in the hmo administrative ratio was due to the achievement of certain operating efficiencies as fixed overhead costs and expenses were allocated over a larger membership base due to the increase in membership resulting from the choicecare transaction 
during  health power hmo acquired certain contract rights from choicecare for a purchase price of million 
this acquisition enabled the medicaid recipients previously served by choicecare to be automatically enrolled in health power hmo as of july  because of the nature of the intangible asset acquired  the company elected to write off the entire purchase price in the company s interest and other income decreased million to million for  from million for this decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in interest income caused by decreases in the average available investable cash balance combined with reduced interest yields 
the decrease in the average available investable cash balance was primarily the result of the payment of the million purchase price for the acquisition of the choicecare contract rights at the end of the second quarter of and the operating losses sustained during the year 
the company had an income tax benefit of million for  as compared to an income tax benefit of  for this tax benefit was the result of a loss from operations of million 
as a result of the foregoing  the company sustained a net loss of million  or per share  diluted  for  as compared to net income of  or per share  diluted  for liquidity and capital resources the company finances its operations through internally generated funds  and its principal sources of cash have been contract and mco revenues from compmanagement and compmanagement health systems  respectively  premium revenues from health power hmo  and investment income 
the company s principal capital needs are to fund ongoing operations and to maintain necessary regulatory capital 
at december   the statutory net worth of health power hmo was  which did not meet ohio s minimum statutory net worth requirements in effect on such date 
furthermore  the minimum statutory net worth dollar amount requirement was increased to million effective as of january  see footnote of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
health power hmo has submitted a corrective action plan to odi outlining the proposed actions to be undertaken by the hmo to bring it in compliance with the minimum statutory net worth requirements 
the corrective action plan is currently under review by odi 
health power hmo had been placed under supervision by odi in december  because of its failure to satisfy the minimum statutory net worth requirements 
it was released from supervision in march  after satisfying odi s release requirements 
this increased minimum statutory net worth requirement will place an additional burden on the company s capital needs during at december   the company had working capital of million  as compared to working capital of million at december  at december   cash and cash equivalents were million  a decrease of million from million at december  this decrease was attributable primarily to a decrease in cash from operating activities of million and a decrease in cash from investing activities of million 
the company s cash and cash equivalents do not include statutory cash deposits segregated as required by odi and odhs 
these deposits of million as of december   are included with other assets on the balance sheet 
compmanagement has entered into a lease agreement to lease a  square foot building in dublin  ohio  and began occupying this space in november the lease is for a term of years  provides for annual rents ranging from  in year one to  in year eight and thereafter  and requires compmanagement to pay all operating expenses for the building 
the lease also provides for  among other things  three renewal options of five years each  an option to purchase the building  and a right of first offer with respect to the sale of the building 
the lease restricts compmanagement s ability to distribute funds and or assets to the company or another affiliate unless compmanagement meets certain tangible net worth requirements 
net cash used in operating activities was million for  as compared to net cash used in operating activities of million during in  changes in cash flow from operations were primarily due to changes in net earnings  deferred income taxes  and changes in current assets and current liabilities 
many of these fluctuations are due to timing of cash receipts or payments 
because premium payments received prior to the month of coverage are recorded as deferred revenues  the extent of such receipts can cause fluctuations in the total amount of cash from month to month 
as previously discussed  the company s management believes that  barring unforeseen circumstances  the company s operating results on a consolidated basis will continue to be profitable during the company believes that internally generated funds will be sufficient to support the company s ongoing operations and satisfy regulatory capital requirements during inflation historically  health care costs have risen at a higher rate than the general rate of inflation 
the company believes that its cost containment procedures and contractual arrangements with providers mitigate  but do not wholly offset  the effects of health care cost inflation on its operating results 
while the company does not anticipate capitation rate reductions from odhs in  as was experienced in and  it anticipates only a slight increase in such rates to occur during the second half of there can be no assurance that health care costs will not increase at a rate in excess of such capitation rate increases 
because of the foregoing  the company may be unable to offset the adverse effects of inflationary health care cost increases to its operations 
year compliance the year issue is the result of computer programs having been written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the computer programs used by the company or its subsidiaries that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of uncertain duration in the company s operations  including  among other things  an inability to process transactions or engage in normal business activities 
the company s management currently does not believe that the cost of addressing the year issue will materially effect the company s business  operations  or financial condition or will require material expenditures of capital for year compliance 
forward looking statements  certain factors affecting future results any forward looking statements contained in this form k or any other reports or documents prepared by the company or made by management of the company involve risks and uncertainties  and are subject to change based on various important factors 
the following factors  among others  in some cases have affected and in the future could affect the company s actual financial performance 
dependence upon medicaid program health power hmo participates in the owf medicaid program through its contract with odhs 
under this contract  health power hmo is paid a fixed monthly capitation rate from odhs for each medicaid recipient enrolled in its hmo 
this capitation rate was reduced by approximately in and further reduced by approximately in although increased by approximately in  there can be no assurance that the capitation rates under this contract will not be reduced in the future 
the current contract with odhs expires in september  and there can be no assurance that this contract will be renewed upon its expiration 
for the years ended december    and  medicaid revenues represented approximately   and  respectively  of the company s consolidated revenues 
the loss of this contract or further reductions in capitation rates paid by odhs would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and operations 
furthermore  because of favorable economic conditions  ohio experienced a decrease in the number of eligible medicaid recipients enrolled in the owf program during this decrease has impacted health power hmo by a loss of medicaid membership during the latter half of caused by involuntary terminations 
involuntary terminations relate to members who are no longer eligible to receive medicaid benefits 
the decrease in the number of eligible medicaid recipients may continue to negatively impact health power hmo in dependence upon health partnership program compmanagement health systems participates in ohio s health partnership program through its contract with obwc 
this contract is for a two year term expiring in march there can be no assurance that obwc will renew this contract when it expires 
furthermore  obwc may at any time initiate proceedings to decertify compmanagement health systems as an mco if compmanagement health systems fails to satisfactorily perform its duties under the contract  and if such decertification occurs  the contract will automatically terminate 
finally  of the fees payable under this contract are subject to the attainment of certain objective and subjective performance measurements established by obwc 
there can be no assurance that compmanagement health systems will be able to meet all or any of these performance measurements 
this contract accounts for all of its revenues  which revenues were million in for the year ended december   compmanagement health systems revenues represented approximately of the company s consolidated revenues 
the loss of this contract or the failure to significantly satisfy the performance measurements under the contract would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and operations 
dependence upon group rating plans compmanagement provides administrative services for group rating plans for over trade associations  which include approximately  employers 
each association and employer administrative agreement is typically for a one year service period 
revenues from group rating plans represented approximately of compmanagement s revenues  with three trade associations accounting for approximately of such revenues 
there can be no assurance that the agreements with these three trade associations or any other associations or employers will be renewed upon their expiration  or if renewed  upon terms favorable to compmanagement 
the failure to renew one or more of the contracts with these three trade associations could have a material adverse effect upon the company s revenues 
government regulation each of the company s operating subsidiaries are subject to regulation by governmental agencies or are otherwise dependent upon plans or programs administered by governmental agencies 
these governmental plans and programs have been implemented pursuant to state statutes and regulations and  in the case of medicaid  federal statutes and regulations 
health power hmo is subject to extensive regulation by various state agencies relating to  among other things  scope of benefits  premium rates  quality assurance procedures  enrollment requirements and financial condition 
compmanagement health systems is subject to extensive regulation by obwc relating to the operation of its mco 
any changes to ohio s statutes or regulations applicable to group rating plans or the health partnership program  or interpretations of these statutes and regulations by obwc  could have a material adverse effect upon the revenues and operations of compmanagement and compmanagement health systems 
any changes to the medicaid program could have a material adverse effect upon the revenues and operations of health power hmo 
there can be no assurance that the company s subsidiaries will be able to continue to maintain required regulatory authority or that regulatory changes will not have an adverse impact on the company in the future 
control of health care costs health power hmo s profitability is dependent  in part  upon its ability to predict and control health care costs 
health care costs are affected by a variety of factors that are difficult to predict and not entirely within health power hmo s control  including the severity and frequency of claims 
health care cost inflation  new technologies  natural disasters  epidemics and other external factors may adversely affect health power hmo s ability to control the costs of providing health care services 
although health power hmo attempts to control these health care costs through a variety of techniques  including capitation and fee schedule arrangements with primary care physicians and other providers  advance approval for elective hospital admissions  utilization review  appropriate underwriting criteria  quality assurance programs and reinsurance arrangements  there can be no assurance that health power hmo will be successful in its efforts to control these costs in the future 
estimation of unpaid claims  severity of claims  potential liability health power hmo s health care costs include estimates of health care costs incurred but not yet reported ibnr 
health power hmo estimates its ibnr health care costs based on a number of factors  including hospital admission data and prior claims experience 
adjustments  if necessary  are made to health care costs in the period during which the actual claim costs are ultimately determined 
health power hmo utilizes an independent actuary to review the adequacy of its ibnr estimates 
the company believes that such ibnr estimates are adequate to satisfy health power hmo s ultimate claims liability 
however  there can be no assurance as to the adequacy of such ibnr estimates or that adjustments to such ibnr estimates will not have a material adverse affect on the company s operations 
the occurrence of certain severe medical claims by hmo members cannot be predicted with any certainty 
in order to protect itself against severe claims with respect to its commercial members  health power hmo maintains reinsurance coverages in amounts it believes adequate for its commercial business 
however  there is a risk that  because of average daily maximum limitations  health power hmo could be responsible for hospital costs in excess of its deductible  which is currently  health power hmo also maintains  as required by odhs  stop loss insurance with respect to its medicaid members 
no assurance can be given as to the future availability or cost of such reinsurance or stop loss coverage or that losses or risks will be maintained within the limits of such coverage 
notwithstanding the maintenance of reinsurance coverage  the severity of claims  in particular by health power hmo s commercial members  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
health power hmo is also subject to the risk of other claims normally associated with the operation of an hmo  including claims resulting from decisions regarding providers  medical circumstances or necessity of treatment  including failure to approve medical procedures or hospital admissions  claims against health power hmo for malpractice by providers in its network  claims for failure to provide coverage or wrongful termination of coverage  claims resulting from other issues with employer groups  members or providers and other general liability claims 
various claims have recently been made against other hmos to expand the liability of the hmo to include damages arising from a member s failure to obtain medical treatment due to the hmos refusal of coverage or the negligence of providers with whom the hmo directly or indirectly contracts 
certain legislation currently before the ohio general assembly includes provisions expanding liability of managed health care companies to include damages arising from a member s failure to obtain medical treatment due to the hmos refusal of coverage 
although health power hmo maintains malpractice and general liability insurance and requires its providers to maintain malpractice insurance  there is a risk that claims could exceed or not be covered by insurance 
dependence on key personnel the operations of health power hmo is highly dependent upon the efforts of certain key personnel  particularly dr 
bernard f 
master  who serves as both its chief executive officer and chief operating officer 
the operations of compmanagement and compmanagement health systems are highly dependent upon the efforts of certain key personnel  particularly robert j 
bossart  jonathan r 
wagner  and richard t 
kurth 
the loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on the operations of the company 
the company or one of its subsidiaries has employment agreements with each of these individuals 
competition the company s subsidiaries each operate in industries which are highly competitive 
each of the company s subsidiaries compete with numerous types of competitors  many of which have greater financial and other resources 
additional competitors may enter the company s areas of operations in the future
