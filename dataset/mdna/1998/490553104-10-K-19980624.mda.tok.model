futronix systems is a redistributor of specialty wire and cable to electrical distributors nationwide 
futronix systems provides just in time availability of the exact quantities of specialty wire and cable products as well as limited quantities of complementary products 

k tec is a manufacturer whose capabilities include custom made electronic interconnect assemblies  printed circuit board assemblies  sheet metal fabrication  powder painting  plastic injection molding  specially fabricated battery power packs  other subassemblies that are built to customers specifications and final system integration box build 
the company focuses on providing its customers a continuum of products and services that emphasizes technology based materials management and manufacturing solutions 
to successfully execute its strategy  during the three fiscal years ended march   the company invested approximately million in capital expenditures 
these expenditures were primarily for construction of the state of the art k tec facility in sugar land  texas completed in spring  consisting of approximately  square feet for manufacturing and warehousing operations and the adjacent state of the art  square foot distribution facility that is scheduled for completion in late summer industry overview outsourcing is a rapidly growing trend in many industry sectors in the united states as companies seek to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies 
electronics original equipment manufacturers oems are increasingly outsourcing materials management and manufacturing operations  ranging from inventory management to complete box build combined with distribution to the end customer 
manufacturers of electronic products are responding to this trend by utilizing technology based materials management and logistical solutions provided by distributors 
in addition  the company believes that there is an emerging trend of oems to align with contract manufacturers who have distribution capabilities and expertise 
because of its experience in both distribution and manufacturing  the company is particularly well positioned to capitalize on these trends 
the potential benefits from outsourcing materials management and manufacturing operations include focused resources 
because the electronics industry is experiencing greater levels of competition and more rapid technological change  many oems are focusing their resources on activities and technologies in which they add the greatest value 
by offering comprehensive materials management solutions and integrated manufacturing services  the company allows oems to focus on their core competencies  such as product development and marketing 
improved inventory management and purchasing power 
electronics oems are faced with increasing difficulties in efficiently planning  procuring and managing their inventories due to frequent design changes  short product life cycles  large investments in electronic components  component price fluctuations and the need to achieve economies of scale in materials procurement 
by using the company s volume procurement capabilities and expertise in inventory management  an oem can reduce production and inventory costs 
reduced time to market 
due to intense competitive pressures and rapid technological developments in the electronics industry  oems are faced with increasingly shorter product life cycles and therefore have a growing need to reduce the time required to bring a product to market 
oems can reduce their time to market by using the company s expertise in providing materials management  logistical and manufacturing solutions 
reduced costs and capital investment 
as electronic products have become more technologically advanced and shipped in greater volumes  the distribution and manufacturing processes have become increasingly automated  requiring greater investments in technology and capital equipment on an ongoing basis 
the company s materials management services allow manufacturers to operate more efficiently by relying on scheduled deliveries of components at the time they are needed in the production process  thereby reducing inventory levels 
k tec s contract manufacturing services enable an oem to gain access to advanced  high volume manufacturing and distribution capabilities while reducing the oem s capital requirements 
access to leading manufacturing technology 
electronic products and electronics manufacturing technology have become increasingly sophisticated and complex  making it more difficult and expensive for oems to maintain the necessary technological expertise to manufacture products internally 
oems are motivated to work with a contract manufacturer in order to gain access to specialized process expertise and manufacturing know how 
company strategy the company is pursuing the following strategies to capitalize on current and emerging electronics industry trends 
providing a continuum of customer services 
the company provides a continuum of services to its customers  ranging from order fulfillment to box build combined with direct distribution to an oem s customers 
in response to evolving customer needs  the company continues to shift from order fulfillment to technology based materials management services 
in addition  the company continues to expand its manufacturing relationships from subassemblies to box build as oems increase their demand for outsourced supply chain management solutions 
remaining a key player in target markets 
the company has focused on markets where it strives to maintain and enhance its position as a national distributor of premier products 
the company believes it can strengthen its position within these markets by expanding its supplier relationships and capitalizing on oems shift toward using distribution channels 
capitalizing on industry consolidation 
the company expects consolidation within the distribution and contract manufacturing sectors of the electronics industry to continue in response to increasing demands on suppliers by oems to provide integrated  technology based materials management and manufacturing solutions 
in addition  the company anticipates increased opportunities to acquire the production capacity of oems following the trend toward outsourcing manufacturing operations 
the company will continue to evaluate and pursue acquisition opportunities that enhance its position as a national distributor and contract manufacturer of electronic products 
capitalizing on network technology proliferation 
the company expects large networking customers to rely increasingly on value added resources to install  fine tune and maintain complex systems 
in response to these customer needs  the company has expanded its professional services  including network design  product configuration  remote network monitoring and troubleshooting  maintenance programs  and technical support 
professional services are a source of incremental revenues  as well as a means of solidifying relationships with customers and suppliers 
maximizing synergies between business units 
the company believes its four business units will continue to enjoy revenue and cost synergies and economies of scale 
these benefits include i greater product offerings to the company s customers across business units  ii purchasing and volume procurement synergies  iii cost efficient opportunities to expand into new geographic markets by utilizing existing facilities and personnel  and iv shared warehousing and materials handling capabilities 
focusing on customer service 
the company continues to emphasize customer service as a competitive advantage 
the company s technology based materials management services enable the company to offer value added solutions to its customers 
similarly  k tec customers have internet access to k tec s intranet in order to monitor printed circuit board production quality  board and box build assembly methods and product throughput in a real time environment 
each customer s internet site is secured and tailored for the customer s unique needs 
the company believes that through these and other customer service innovations it will continue to strengthen and develop customer relationships 
distribution kent components 
kent components focuses primarily on providing its industrial and oem customers with rapid and reliable deliveries of interconnect  passive and electromechanical products as well as a wide variety of materials management services 
the division also provides value added services such as cable assembly  fan assembly  taping and reeling  and component modification 
kent components utilizes a computerized inventory control system to assist in the marketing of its products and to coordinate purchases from suppliers with sales to customers 
the division s computer system provides detailed on line information regarding the availability of the company s entire stock of inventory located at its stocking facilities as well as on line access to the inventories of most of the company s major suppliers 
through its integrated real time information system  the company can readily track customers orders through the entire process of entering the order  reserving products to fill the order  ordering components from suppliers  if necessary  and shipping products to customers on scheduled dates 
kent components is thus able to provide the type of distributor service required by its oem customers that have adopted the just in time method of inventory procurement 
kent components serves numerous markets  including the computer  instrumentation  medical  networking systems and telecommunications markets 
kent datacomm 
kent datacomm designs  delivers  installs and supports a broad array of networking products used in local area networks lans and wide area networks wans 
among the voice and data communication products it offers are network interface cards  switches  hubs  routers  modems  connectivity devices  fiber optics and copper cabling 
kent datacomm s expanded professional services include network design  product configuration  remote network monitoring and troubleshooting  maintenance programs  and day a week  hour a day technical support 
through a focused sales effort  the company believes it is able to participate directly in the large and rapidly growing market for connection devices  reflecting the increasing use of microcomputers in lans and wans and the continued growth in networking and cabling needs of minicomputer and mainframe users 
kent datacomm serves numerous industries  including the aerospace  airline  financial  food  government  manufacturing and medical industries 
futronix systems 
futronix systems is a redistributor of specialty wire and cable  serving more than  electrical distributors throughout the united states 
futronix systems seeks to serve as an efficient single source of supply and as the distributor of choice for electrical distributors by maintaining for immediate delivery large quantities of over  specialty wire and cable products purchased from more than manufacturers worldwide  as well as limited quantities of complementary products 
as a redistributor  futronix systems enables electrical distributors to purchase exact quantities  gain immediate access to products  obtain a wider variety of products and lower overall materials acquisition costs 
the products of futronix systems typically are used in industrial applications  including computer systems  factory automation  intelligent buildings and telecommunication systems 
futronix systems generally does not sell commodity wire and cable  such as that used in commercial and residential construction 
the company believes that there are opportunities for redistribution of existing company product offerings through futronix systems 
contract manufacturing k tec provides vertically integrated electronic manufacturing products and services  including printed circuit board assembly and test  electronic interconnect assemblies  specially fabricated battery power packs  subassemblies  sheet metal fabrication and powder paint  plastic injection molding and box build 
the company has developed innovative material requirements planning relationships with a select group of oems in the data processing  energy  medical instrumentation and telecommunications industries 
these relationships are supported by sophisticated in house product design and technical support capabilities 
k tec support teams work closely with k tec s customers through all stages of product planning and production to apply advanced design and production technology 
k tec s computer systems have a computer aided design capability that allows its engineers to be on line with an oem s engineers when developing and changing product designs 
in addition  k tec customers have internet access to k tec s intranet in order to monitor printed circuit board production quality  board and box build assembly methods and product throughput in a real time environment 
each customer s internet site is secured and tailored for the customer s unique needs 
k tec s quality control standards provide another means of serving the needs of the company s customers  since oems rely on suppliers to assure quality control for subassemblies rather than providing such quality control themselves 
the company believes that k tec s adherence to strict quality control standards and investment in state of the art production facilities and equipment have attracted and retained important customers who have established extremely rigid product quality standards 
k tec further compliments its offering by providing full logistics support which allows the final assembly to be shipped directly to the customer s end customer 
this supply chain management ability differentiates k tec as a resource in enhancing customers cost efficiency and time to market 
marketing each of the company s business units maintains its own direct sales force 
at march   the company employed approximately sales representatives operating out of sales offices in cities in states 
the company s sales representatives undergo continuous training and attend classes in order to enhance both their technical expertise and sales techniques 
sales associates are compensated primarily on a commission basis 
in the marketing of its products  the company supplements the efforts of its direct sales force with direct mailings of brochures and catalogs as well as advertisements in trade journals 
the company concentrates its efforts in certain targeted markets in which it only distributes the products of a select group of leading suppliers 
this facilitates sales personnel specialization within related product groupings  and permits sales representatives to develop a high degree of technical expertise 
competition the company faces intense competition from a large number of distributors  suppliers and domestic and foreign manufacturers  some of which are larger  have greater financial resources  broader name recognition  and may  in some instances  have lower costs than the company 
according to industry publications  the company was the ninth largest electronics distributor in the united states based on total calendar year sales 
industry publications estimate that eleven distributors each had calendar year north american sales in excess of million 
the company s manufacturing operations encounter competition from both domestic and foreign manufacturers 
foreign manufactured products are often sold at prices below the company s prices for comparable products 
the company s products are not protected from competition by any proprietary or intellectual property rights such as trade secrets or patents 
the company competes by providing its customers with reliable  rapid delivery of products that are priced at competitive levels and meet strict quality control standards 
backlog the company s backlog consisting of orders the company believes to be firm is based upon its internal tracking system  including verbal orders from customers  as well as written purchase orders  all of which may be modified  rescheduled or canceled without penalty 
historically  the company s backlog figures have provided an indication of future sales in the short term  but traditional backlog has become a less meaningful indicator of future sales for the company 
in recent years  since the company s business has been increasingly conducted through just in time and other materials management programs  the company is required to provide materials in accordance with continually changing forecasts 
this trend continued in fiscal and is reflected in the decline in the company s estimated backlog  exclusive of just in time and other materials management programs and forecasts  to million as of march   from million as of march  the company is currently evaluating another means of indication of future sales arising from just in time and other materials management programs and forecasts 
employees at march   the company employed approximately  persons  all on a full time basis 
the company s employees are not subject to any collective bargaining agreement 
in addition to its employees  the company uses other workers on a contract basis  as its needs require 
trademarks the company has registered a number of trademarks and service marks relating to the operation of its business 
these have been of value to the company in the past and are expected to be of value in the future 
the loss of a single trademark or service mark other than ke kent electronics or k tec electronics  in the opinion of management  would not have a material adverse effect on the conduct of its business 
item properties in october  the company moved its headquarters to its k tec facility located in sugar land  texas 
the company s k tec facility was completed in spring and consists of approximately  square feet for manufacturing and warehousing operations and approximately  square feet for office purposes 
in addition  the company expects to complete in late summer its new sugar land distribution facility which consists of approximately  square feet 
the company s facilities in sugar land are located on a acre parcel of land 
the company owns a  square foot office facility in houston  texas 
the company also owns a acre tract of vacant land adjacent to the office facility 
in nearby owned facilities  the company uses approximately  square feet of space for office purposes and approximately  square feet for distribution operations 
in addition  the company owns a acre tract of vacant land adjoining these facilities which is the subject of a contract of sale 
the contract of sale provides for the sale of this tract on or before august  provided that this date may be extended under certain circumstances for a sale price payable in cash at the closing 
the purchaser has the right to terminate the contract of sale  with or without cause  at any time on or before july   but as of june   this termination right had not been exercised

although the company intends to continue to invest future earnings in its business  it may determine at some future date that payment of cash dividends on common stock would be desirable 
the payment of any such dividends would depend  among other things  upon the earnings and financial condition of the company 
item selected financial data the following table summarizes selected consolidated financial data of the company for each fiscal year of the five year period ended march  the following selected consolidated financial data should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  included elsewhere herein 
fiscal years ended march  march  march  april  april  in thousands  except per share data and ratio statement of earnings data net sales      cost of sales      gross profit      selling  general and administrative expenses      merger and integration costs  operating profit      other income expense interest expense   other net principally interest and dividend income     earnings before income taxes      income taxes      net earnings      earnings per common share basic diluted weighted average shares basic      diluted      ratio of earnings to fixed charges x x x x x march  march  march  april  april  in thousands balance sheet data working capital      total assets      long term debt  less current maturities    mandatorily redeemable preferred stock   stockholders equity      includes non recurring merger and integration charges of million million  net of taxes  or basic and diluted per share 
exclusive of such charges  fiscal net earnings were million  or basic and diluted per share  and the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was x 
the company adopted financial accounting standard no 
 earnings per share  in fiscal all prior period earnings per common share data have been restated to conform to the provisions of this statement 
for purposes of computing the ratio of earnings to fixed charges  earnings consist of earnings before income taxes plus fixed charges 
fixed charges consist of interest expense  amortization of deferred financing costs and that portion of rental expense deemed representative of the interest factor 
includes million of convertible subordinated notes due issued in fiscal item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  included elsewhere herein 
results of operations the following table presents  as a percentage of net sales  certain selected consolidated financial data for each of the three fiscal years indicated 
fiscal years ended march  march  march  distribution a manufacturing net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses merger and integration costs operating profit other income expense interest expense other net principally interest and dividend income earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings a the principal products the company distributes consist of connectors  receptacles and sockets  which collectively accounted for approximately  and of the company s total sales in its fiscal years ended in  and  respectively  and other electronic connecting components  such as cable and wiring products  which accounted for approximately  and of the company s total sales in such years 
in addition  the company distributes capacitors  resistors and electromechanical parts 
comparison of fiscal with fiscal net sales for the fiscal year ended march  increased million  or  to million 
sales from the company s distribution businesses  which represented of net sales  increased while contract manufacturing sales increased 
the sales increase reflected internal growth primarily from increased demand from existing customers  an expanded customer base and the introduction of new and expanded services from the company s contract manufacturing business 
distribution sales also benefited from a full year of operations of the emc distribution division of electronics marketing corporation  which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal gross profit increased million  or  compared to the prior year 
gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to from from fiscal to fiscal the increase in gross profit was primarily due to increased sales  offset by a decrease in the gross profit percentage 
the decrease in the gross profit percentage was due to continued pricing pressures in the contract manufacturing business and a product mix with a lower percentage of certain higher margin contract manufacturing business 
the company believes that the gross profit percentage could decline if revenues from certain contract manufacturing services  such as printed circuit board assembly and final integration  become a larger percentage of total revenues 
exclusive of non recurring merger and integration charges associated with the acquisition of futronix corporation futronix and wire cable specialties corporation wire cable in fiscal  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased million  or  when compared to the prior fiscal year 
however  as a percentage of sales  expenses declined to from in the preceding year 
the decline as a percentage of sales reflects the company s continued focus on cost containment to reduce such expenses as a percentage of sales 
the increase in expenses was primarily due to the expenses necessary to support the growth in the company s existing operations 
the company believes that its investment in technology in recent years should increase its efficiency and reduce sg a expenses as a percentage of sales 
interest expense increased million due to interest on the convertible subordinated notes due the notes  partially offset by the retirement of all the outstanding debt of futronix and wire cable in the fourth quarter of fiscal other net consists principally of interest and dividend income generated by cash and cash equivalents and trading securities 
the increase in interest and dividend income resulted from investment of the net proceeds from the notes 
net earnings for fiscal were million compared to million for fiscal net earnings for fiscal included merger and integration charges of million  pre tax million  after tax 
excluding these charges  net income increased million  or 
the improved profitability was primarily due to the incremental profit associated with the increase in sales volume  partially offset by the decrease in the gross profit percentage  combined with the company s continued focus on cost containment 
comparison of fiscal with fiscal net sales for the fiscal year ended march  were million  an increase of over the million reported for fiscal the increase in sales was primarily the result of continued gains in market share in the company s distribution operations  which had a increase over fiscal distribution sales also benefited from the december acquisition of the emc distribution division of electronics marketing corporation and a full year of operations in geographical markets entered during fiscal by futronix and wire cable 
the company s contract manufacturing operations posted an increase over the prior year despite a significant downturn in the semiconductor capital equipment sector during the september quarter of fiscal the semiconductor capital equipment sector accounted for approximately of the manufacturing division revenue in fiscal compared to approximately in fiscal gross profit increased million  or  from fiscal to fiscal due to an increase in net sales 
the decrease in gross profit margin from to reflected continued pricing pressures and a product mix with a lower percentage of certain higher margin contract manufacturing business 
excluding merger and integration charges associated with the acquisition of futronix and wire cable  sg a expenses increased million  or  compared to the prior year 
this increase reflected the costs necessary to support the continued growth in the company s operations 
as a percentage of sales  however  expenses decreased to from in the prior year 
the decrease was the result of the company s continued focus on cost containment as well as specific cost reduction initiatives taken in response to the difficult business conditions the company experienced during the year 
sg a expenses do not reflect the cost savings or synergies which may result from the merger of futronix and wire cable 
merger and integration charges of million include abandoned registration costs associated with the planned business combination of futronix and wire cable  professional expenses associated with the acquisition  an employee bonus and integration costs incurred to consolidate operations 
interest expense increased due to higher short term borrowing by futronix and wire cable prior to acquisition by the company 
all outstanding debt was retired in the fourth quarter of fiscal other net consists principally of interest and dividend income generated by cash  cash equivalents and trading securities 
the increase in interest and dividend income was primarily due to the net proceeds from the september public offering invested for approximately four months longer than the prior year 
net earnings for fiscal were million compared to million for fiscal net earnings for fiscal included merger and integration charges of million  pre tax million after tax 
excluding these charges  net income increased million  or  to million 
the improved profitability was primarily due to the incremental profit associated with the increase in sales volume  offset by lower gross profit margins  combined with the company s continued focus on cost containment 
liquidity and capital resources at march   working capital was million  an increase of million  or  since march  the increase was primarily the result of net proceeds from the notes offering  and to a lesser extent  growth in accounts receivable and inventories  offset by an increase in accounts payable  in relation to current and future sales levels 
included in the company s working capital at march  are investments  including trading securities  of million  an increase of million since march  the increase was primarily the result of the notes offering  offset by capital expenditures of million 
the company s investment strategy is low risk and short term  keeping the funds readily available to meet capital requirements as they arise in the normal course of business 
at march   funds were invested primarily in a reverse repurchase agreement  institutional money market funds and a managed fund consisting primarily of taxable  high quality corporate debt instruments 
these investments are compatible with the company s stated investment strategy 
the company maintains a million unsecured line of credit with a bank 
there have been no borrowings  and as of march   there was no indebtedness outstanding under the line of credit 
the company intends to apply its capital resources to expand its business by establishing or acquiring similar distribution and manufacturing operations in geographic areas that are attractive to the company  by acquiring new facilities and by enlarging or improving existing facilities 
in addition to the capital required to purchase existing businesses or to fund start up operations  the expansion of the company s operations at both new and existing locations will require greater levels of capital to finance the purchase of additional equipment  increased levels of inventory and greater accounts receivable 
the company believes that current resources  including the line of credit  along with funds generated from operations  should be sufficient to meet its current capital requirements 
year compliance the year issue results from computer hardware and software systems as well as computer controlled devices  including equipment used in the manufacture or distribution of the company s products  collectively computer systems that do not differentiate between centuries  accordingly  these computer systems can potentially fail 
as a result of the company s strategic migration to new application systems in recent years  many of the company s computer systems are year compliant 
in general  the company expects to resolve any remaining year issues through planned replacement or upgrades of its computer systems 
the company presently intends to utilize internal and external resources to identify  correct or reprogram and test its computer systems for year compliance 
in addition  the company is monitoring the compliance efforts of suppliers  service providers and other entities with which it has a business relationship regarding compliance with year requirements 
until the assessments are complete  the company cannot state with certainty whether it has  or will have  significant year issues 
however  based on the information currently available  the company has no reason to believe that the year issues will be material to its results of operations  consolidated financial position or liquidity 
risks relating to forward looking statements the company is including the following cautionary statements to secure the protection of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of for all forward looking statements made by the company in this annual report on form k 
forward looking statements include  without limitation  any statement that may predict  forecast  indicate  or imply future results  performance  or trends  and may contain the words believe  anticipate  expect  estimate  project  will be  will continue  will likely result  or words or phrases of similar meaning 
in addition  from time to time  the company or its representatives may make forward looking statements of this nature in its annual report to shareholders  proxy statement  quarterly reports on form q  current reports on form k or in oral or written presentations to shareholders  securities analysts  members of the financial press or others 
all such forward looking statements  whether written or oral  and whether made by or on behalf of the company  are expressly qualified by these cautionary statements and any other cautionary statements which may accompany the forward looking statements 
in addition  the forward looking statements speak only of the company s view as of the date the statement was made  and the company disclaims any obligation to update any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results  performance or trends to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
the company believes that all forward looking statements made by it have a reasonable basis  but there can be no assurance that management s expectations  beliefs or projections as expressed in the forward looking statements will actually occur or prove to be correct 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below 
downward pressure on margins 
in recent quarters  the company has experienced downward pressure on its gross profit margin primarily due to a lower percentage of certain high margin sales within its contract manufacturing business 
the company s decrease in gross profit margin has been partially offset by growth in sales and a reduction in sg a expenses as a percentage of sales resulting from the company s continued focus on cost containment 
the company believes that these recent gross profit margin trends will continue 
cycles in the electronics industry  general economic conditions 
the company s business depends on sustained demand for the products it distributes and manufactures 
although the company has enjoyed high rates of growth in sales in recent years  the electronics industry is cyclical  and there can be no assurance that such growth will continue at rates comparable to the company s historical levels 
in addition  the company s business is subject to general business  economic  market  financial and industry conditions 
for example  certain customers of the company sell and distribute their products in asia and have seen the demand for their products decline substantially during the current economic downturn in asia  which has had an adverse effect on the company 
a continued downturn in the asian market or a downturn in the electronics industry in general could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition  especially if a downturn occurred in the company s distribution and manufacturing businesses simultaneously 
dependence on k tec customers  uncertainty of increasing contract manufacturing sales 
for many years k tec has strategically developed long term relationships with a select group of oems resulting in a concentrated customer base 
the company expects that sales to a relatively small number of customers will continue to account for a significant portion of k tec s sales in the future 
the loss of  or a significant decline in orders from  one or more of k tec s key customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  with the completion of its k tec facility  the company has increased substantially its contract manufacturing capacity 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to secure the new oem relationships that will be essential to utilizing this additional capacity and achieving significant sales growth in the company s contract manufacturing business 
management of growth 
in recent years  the company has expanded its business through internal growth and acquisitions  and the company anticipates that it will continue this expansion in the future 
to effectively manage this expansion  the company will be required to attract and retain highly skilled managers and personnel and to evaluate the adequacy of existing systems and procedures  including  but not limited to  information management systems  financial and internal control systems  and management structure 
in addition  if the company enters new markets  it will be required to  among other things  establish suitable distribution centers  hire personnel and establish distribution channels 
moreover  the company anticipates that in response to the growing trend of oems to outsource manufacturing operations  the company will expand k tec s box build operations and increasingly combine those operations with the company s distribution capabilities 
there can be no assurance that management will adequately anticipate all of the changing demands that growth and industry conditions and trends will impose on the company or that the company will be able to adapt timely its pricing  costs  systems  procedures and structure to such demands 
any failure to anticipate and respond promptly and effectively to such changing demands and industry trends could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
competition 
the markets for the company s products and services are highly competitive 
the company competes with a large number of distributors  suppliers and domestic and foreign manufacturers 
foreign manufactured products are often sold at prices below the company s prices for comparable products 
the company s products are not protected from competition by any proprietary or intellectual property rights such as trade secrets or patents 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to compete successfully against the distributors  suppliers and manufacturers within its industry  some of which are larger  have greater financial resources and broader name recognition  and may  in some instances  have lower costs than the company 
in addition  although the company continues to focus on cost containment  there can be no assurance that increasingly intense competition will not cause pricing or marketing pressures that reduce gross profit margins or increase sg a expenses as a percentage of sales 
reduced gross profit margins and increased sg a expenses as a percentage of sales  either alone or together  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
risks associated with acquisitions 
the company will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire complementary businesses  assets or technologies  and the company expects to pursue acquisitions that it believes will enhance its position as a national distributor and contract manufacturer of electronic products 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to identify and acquire complementary businesses  assets or technologies 
among other things  the company may not be able to identify acquisition candidates in desirable geographic or product markets on terms that are satisfactory to the company 
moreover  acquisitions require the expenditure of large amounts of capital  and the company s competitors for acquisitions may have significantly greater financial resources than the company 
therefore  to finance acquisitions  the company may have to raise additional funds through either public or private financings 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to integrate successfully the operations  facilities and management of any acquired business or realize any expected synergies  including cost reductions  from any acquisition 
moreover  there can be no assurance that any acquisition will not have an adverse effect on the company s relationships with customers or suppliers of an acquired business 
failure to integrate successfully any acquisition made by the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on significant suppliers 
as is customary in the electronics distribution industry  the company primarily operates under short term contracts with its suppliers 
in the company s past experience  such contracts have typically been renewed from year to year 
in the fiscal year ended march   the company s purchases from amp incorporated and belden inc represented approximately and  respectively  of the company s total purchases 
although the company believes that it may be able to obtain competitive products of comparable quality from other suppliers  the loss of such suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition
