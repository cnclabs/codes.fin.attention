the maximum amount available under the revolver at the end of the third quarter was million and was scheduled to be reduced by million and million on october  and april   respectively 
under the terms of the credit agreement  the company would have been required to repay million on october  to reduce the outstanding revolver balance including letters of credit to the scheduled maximum of million 
in addition  the company had a mortgage financing of million due on november  based on the company s operating results during the first three quarters of and expected operating results for the fourth quarter  including the expenses incurred in connection with the proxy contest  the company s cash flow from operations  supplemented by its available unused line of credit  were insufficient to permit the company to fund the scheduled payments 
in addition  management did not expect to be in compliance with certain financial covenants in its credit agreements at the end of  which together with the company s inability to fund the scheduled principal payment due during the fourth quarter would have placed the company in default under its credit agreements 
as a result of the foregoing issues  during the fourth quarter of  the company obtained a firm commitment from nationsbank  na to refinance certain existing debt obligations 
the company obtained waivers from its lenders for the payments of million and million due in october and november  respectively  until december   by which date the refinancing was expected to have been completed 
the lenders also waived  until december   the company s anticipated non compliance with its debt covenants for the year ended october  the company closed the refinancing on december  the new million credit facility consists of a million revolving line of credit the revolver and two term notes of million and million  respectively  due in the term notes replace the revolver  bridge loan  and a series of mortgage financings 
the new term facilities and revolver provide the company with additional liquidity and a debt amortization schedule which supports the company s business improvement plans 
based upon its commitment letter and waivers from its lending banks  the company classified the amounts due under the revolver  bridge loan and mortgage financings subsequently refinanced as long term at october  during the first quarter of  the company elected to close approximately under performing shoney s restaurants  of which had been closed and had been sold  leased  or had the leases terminated as of october  the company is marketing these properties and leasehold interests and is required to apply all proceeds to reduce senior bank debt 
in the first quarter of  the company also identified additional shoney s restaurants which have been given increased supervisory management attention in an effort to improve their financial performance 
at october   there were of these restaurants in operation which had revenues of million  a loss before interest and taxes of million  and a carrying value of million at october  during the first and second quarters of  management plans to reassess the performance of these restaurants and  for those units which have limited improvement potential  will consider the closure and the sale or sublease of such properties to generate additional cash flow to reduce debt 
to the extent the company determines to close such restaurants which are leased  the company will incur additional expense charges in related to the accrual of lease costs for the unexpired lease terms 
the company also has approximately surplus and rental properties which are being marketed and the proceeds from such sales will be used to reduce debt 
the company utilizes its net cash flow principally for capital expenditures for the construction  acquisition  and remodeling of its restaurants and for its distribution and manufacturing operation  the reduction of debt and for the payment of its litigation settlement see note to the consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures for were originally budgeted for million  however  in light of the company s negative comparable store sales trends and poor operating performance  such expenditures were reduced to million 
the reduction in capital spending was achieved by postponement of restaurant construction  reductions in maintenance capital expenditures and postponement of restaurant remodeling 
the company balances its capital spending plan throughout the year based on operating results and will decrease capital spending  if needed  to balance cash from operations  capital expenditures and debt service requirements 
the company has planned capital expenditures for of million  the maximum amount permitted under its new credit agreement 
the company does not plan to build new restaurants during and will focus its capital expenditures on improvements to existing operations 
budgeted capital expenditures for include million for remodeling and refurbishment of restaurants  million for capitalizable maintenance  and million for other assets 
the company s lending agreements contain covenants that impose limitations on capital expenditures  require satisfaction of certain financial ratios and tests which generally become more restrictive each year and prohibit the company from paying dividends and places limitations on its ability to incur additional indebtedness 
the company believes that it can meet its needs for debt service  capital expenditures  the litigation settlement and other general corporate purposes for the next twelve months through cash generated by the company s operations  the sale of assets and the revolver 
the company s new credit facility has a debt amortization schedule that defers  until the latter part of the term of the credit facility  significant debt repayments for the million term loan due in in addition  million principal amount of the company s subordinated convertible debentures mature in  resulting in scheduled debt payments in that year of approximately million 
the company currently believes its cash flow from operations and from proceeds from asset sales of surplus restaurants  land and certain rental properties will be sufficient to reduce its debt balances under the new credit facility in excess of amounts required by the credit agreement 
as a result  the company expects its debt due in to be substantially less than million and plans to refinance a portion of its long term debt prior to management s plans are predicated on modest improvements in operating performance of its shoney s and captain d s restaurants which it believes to be conservative 
however  if performance of the company s shoney s restaurants does not improve  its cash flow would be negatively affected  and it may experience difficulty in refinancing its debt in the future 
in such an event  management believes the company can meet its needs for liquidity from the sale of other operating assets 
at october   the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and had an available secured line of credit totaling million with an interest rate of 
this million secured line of credit was terminated in conjunction with the refinancing of the company s senior debt on december  and was replaced by the revolver  of which million of availability has been used to support letters of credit as of january  risk factors the company s business is highly competitive with respect to food quality  concept  location  service and price 
in addition  there are a number of well established food service competitors with substantially greater financial and other resources compared to the company 
the company s shoney s restaurants have experienced declining customer traffic during the past five years as a result of intense competition and a decline in operational execution  food quality and service standards 
the company has initiated a number of programs to address the decline in customer traffic  however  performance improvement efforts for the shoney s restaurants during the past three years have not resulted in improvements in sales and margins and there can be no assurance that the current programs will be successful 
the company has experienced increased costs for labor and operating expenses at its restaurant concepts  which coupled with a decrease in average restaurant sales volumes  has reduced its operating margins 
the company does not expect to be able to significantly improve operating margins until it can increase its comparable restaurant sales and restaurant average sales volumes 
the company is highly leveraged and  under the terms of its credit agreements  generally is not permitted to incur additional debt and its annual capital expenditures are limited to million 
the company has recently completed a million refinancing of its senior debt 
the interest rates for the new debt agreements are higher than those for the debt refinanced  and may result in increased interest costs 
management believes that planned asset sales will permit a reduction in total debt outstanding and should reduce the impact of the higher interest rates 
however  there is no assurance that such asset sales will occur as quickly as management anticipates or that actual sales proceeds will correspond to management s estimates 
management believes the annual capital expenditures permitted under the new credit agreement will be sufficient for the execution of its business plan  however  the restrictions on capital spending will cause delay in the implementation of certain improvement initiatives 
in the past five years  the company has had significant turnover of its senior management 
in august  the company settled a dissident shareholder proxy contest that had sought to replace the company s board of directors 
these changes have resulted in disruption to its business operations  increased costs for executive recruitment  relocation  salaries and severance costs 
in november  the company s board of directors appointed j 
michael bodnar as ceo and president 
mr 
bodnar had been named to the company s board in august in connection with the settlement of the proxy contest 
since  the company has closed a number of under performing restaurants and has identified certain additional under performing restaurants that it may close in the future 
management plans to sell or lease these restaurant properties and will be required to utilize the proceeds to reduce its indebtedness 
these restaurants are not profitable and generally have negative cash flow so that their closure and sale are expected to have a positive effect on profitability and cash flow in future periods 
however  in the event management elects to close additional restaurants during  the company may incur additional expense charges for lease termination costs 
as more fully discussed in note and note to the consolidated financial statements  the company is a defendant in three lawsuits  two of which have been provisionally certified as class actions  which allege that the company violated certain provisions of the fair labor standards act 
discovery is proceeding in two cases but is in a preliminary stage 
the third case was filed in december subsequent to the company s year end and discovery in that case has not yet commenced 
management believes that it has substantial defenses to the claims made and intends to vigorously defend these cases 
however  neither the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome nor the amount of ultimate liability  if any  with respect to these cases can currently be determined and  accordingly  no provision for any potential liability has been accrued in the financial statements 
in the event of an unfavorable outcome in these cases resulting in a material award for the plaintiffs  the company s financial position  results of operations and liquidity could be adversely affected 
impact of the year the company has completed an assessment of its year information systems compliance issues and has begun implementation of a plan to ensure its systems are fully year compliant 
management believes that the company has resolved its material year compliance issues  and the cost of such compliance has not had a material impact on the company s results of operations
