item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
wherever in this discussion the term company is used  it should be understood to refer to shpi and shp  on a consolidated basis  except where the context clearly indicates to the contrary 
prior to the acquisition  shpi had no operations 
overview from its inception  the company has incurred losses from operations 
as of december   the company had cumulative net losses totaling  to date  the company s principal focus has been the design  development  testing  and evaluation of its safety cradle r sharps containers  extresafe r lancet strip  extresafe r medical needle withdrawal technology  intravenous flow gauge  blood collection device  and other products  and the design and development of its molds and production processes relating to its safety cradle r sharps containers and extresafe r lancet strip 
financial position the company had  in cash and cash equivalents as of december  this represented an increase of  from december  working capital as of december   also increased to  as compared to  at december  these increases were largely due to the company raising  in funding from the private placement of company securities and receiving  in prepaid royalties and  in development fees during years ended december   and during the year ended december   the company had total operating revenues of  compared with total operating revenues of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
total operating revenues were comprised of product sales and development fees 
during  bdit paid the company  in development fees for services provided in there was no revenue from similar sources during the prior years 
during the year ended december   the company had net product sales of  compared with net product sales of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
substantially all of the sales during these periods related to the company s sharps containers 
as discussed below  the company will look to several other sources for future sales revenues 
the company employs a limited number of sales people and seeks to market and sell its products through third party distributors and or licensees 
consistent with this strategy  substantially all of the  sales during were generated by sales through or to third party distributors 
during  the company began negotiating for the distribution of the safety cradle r sharps containers by bdsds 
during such negotiations  which began during the first quarter of and ended in august of when the bdsds distribution agreement was signed  the company agreed not to enter into any exclusive marketing or distribution agreements 
sales under the bdsds distribution agreement did not begin until the restrictions imposed by the negotiation and execution of the bdsds distribution agreement and certain improvements that were made to the safety cradle r sharps containers that were completed during the first quarter of had a substantial negative impact on the company s sales of safety cradle r sharps containers 
bdsds began selling the safety cradle r sharps containers under the bdsds distribution agreement in the first quarter of during  however  bdsds did not order the minimum required amount of product under the terms of the bdsds distribution agreement and  therefore  bdsds exclusive distribution rights became nonexclusive 
in addition  the company gave notice of termination of the bdsds distribution agreement  as it is authorized to do in the case of bdsds failure to purchase the minimum amount of product required by the bdsds distribution agreement 
the parties subsequently agreed to extend the termination date and exclusivity provision of the bdsds distribution agreement until may  the distribution agreement provides that products may be sold  at bd s option  either under the company s name or under bd s label 
the products will  however  be imprinted with the company s name 
the sales price of the products to bd under the distribution agreement can be adjusted under certain circumstances for changes in raw material costs during the initial term of the distribution agreement 
the company is not required to distribute any future  unrelated products through bd 
company management is disappointed with sales of the safety cradle r sharps containers under the bdsds distribution agreement and hopes to increase sales in by negotiating a more favorable agreement with bdsds or one or more other distributors and or licensees with the proper focus and strategy to accelerate sales of the company s sharps containers into the home healthcare market 
bdsds and the company are presently negotiating the terms of a new distribution agreement 
there is no assurance  however  that a favorable distribution and or license agreement will be negotiated between the company and bdsds or any other party or that sales will improve 
in may  the company entered into the license agreement relating to a single application of the company s extresafe r safety needle withdrawal technology 
pursuant to the terms of the license agreement  bdit made payments of  and  to the company in june and september  respectively  and is required to make an additional payment of  upon the earlier of the date of the first sales by bdit of a product utilizing the technology or april  of these total payments   represents advanced royalties for sales occurring before the year and the  represents a product development fee 
bdit is also required to pay ongoing royalties to the company based on sales of products utilizing the technology 
in addition  beginning in bdit s fiscal year  bdit is required to pay minimum royalties in order to maintain exclusive rights under the license agreement 
sales are expected to begin under the license agreement in the second half of the extresafe r lancet strip has previously been assembled manually by the company with some automated assembly beginning in november the automated production equipment is not yet in full operation 
the costs of manual assembly exceeded the related revenues from the minimal sales of the extresafe r lancet strip 
the use of automated production equipment substantially reduces the cost to manufacture the extresafe r lancet strip and increases manufacturing capacity 
in september  the company entered into the alliance agreement with alliance medical which provides for the company to manufacture and alliance medical to market and sell the extresafe r lancet strip on an exclusive basis in hospitals  alternate site eg  homecare  plasma centers and blood banks and consumer markets in the united states 
effective march   the alliance agreement was converted to a non exclusive agreement with no sales minimums so that the company can pursue additional sources of distribution 
there is no assurance that the company will realize significant sales under the alliance agreement or that the company will enter into any other arrangements with respect to the marketing and distribution of extresafe r lancet strips 
in december  the company entered into the j j agreement with j j to commercialize two applications of the extresafe r safety needle technology the j j products 
the j j agreement provides for monthly development payments by j j  sharing of field related patent costs  payments for initial periods of low volume manufacturing  an ongoing royalty stream and a j j investment in molds  assembly equipment and other capital costs related to commercialization of each product 
the j j agreement also provides for an ongoing joint cooperative program between the company and j j which derives future funding directly from sales of company created products  payments for initial periods of low volume manufacturing and an ongoing royalty stream for additional safety products which are jointly approved for development 
in connection with the j j agreement  johnson johnson development corporation also purchased  of company securities in a private placement that closed in january in addition  beginning in the later of j j s fiscal year or twelve months following fda approval for sale of the j j products  j j is required to pay minimum royalties 
sales are expected to begin under the j j agreement in the first half of license and distribution arrangements  such as those discussed above  create certain risks for the company  including i reliance for sales of products on other parties  and therefore reliance on the other parties marketing ability  marketing plans and credit worthiness  ii if the company s products are marketed under other parties labels  goodwill associated with use of the products may inure to the benefit of the other parties rather than the company  iii the company may have only limited protection from changes in manufacturing costs and raw materials costs  and iv if the company is reliant on other parties for all or substantially all of its sales  the company may be limited in its ability to negotiate with such other parties upon any renewals of their agreements 
further  because such arrangements are generally expected to provide the company s marketing partners with certain elements of exclusivity with respect to the products to be marketed by those partners  the company s success will be highly dependent on the results obtained by its partners 
research and development expenses were  for the year ended december   compared with  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company s efforts during focused on completing final development of the extresafe r lancet strip  development relating to several products utilizing the extresafe r medical needle withdrawal technology and development work on the filmless digitized imaging technology which was performed by qic  but which was funded by the company 
the company s efforts in focused on making certain improvements to the safety cradle r sharps container products that were required by the bdsds distribution agreement and otherwise  development of the extresafe r lancet strip  extresafe r medical needle withdrawal technology  intravenous flow gauge and blood collection device 
the company s efforts in focused on refining the design and molds for its safety cradle r sharps container products  and upon the design and development of its extresafe r lancet strip  extresafe r medical needle withdrawal technology  intravenous flow gauge and blood collection device 
during the year ended december   the company received  in development fees for services provided in there was no revenue from similar sources during the prior years 
it is anticipated that company revenues from development fees will increase during as a result of the j j agreement 
research and development expenses during through were limited because of funding constraints 
funding constraints also set back the anticipated dates on which the company s products under development will be brought to market 
it is anticipated that if the company has adequate funding during  research and development expenses will increase over levels 
reductions in r d expenditures are not anticipated unless funding constraints require the company to make such reductions 
reductions in r d expenditures would comprise primarily reductions in r d staff 
such staff reductions could have a material adverse effect on product development and on the company 
management does not intend to downsize 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december   compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increases in expenditures between the and periods resulted primarily from an increased number of employees  amounts paid to financial advisors and public relations firms and legal and accounting fees 
the increased costs between and resulted mainly from increases in the following expenditures 
first  selling and consulting costs increased as a result of increased efforts to market and sell the safety cradle r sharps container products 
second  salaries and benefits increased as a result of hiring additional product development  sales and marketing personnel to support sales and commercialization of the company s products as well as pay increases made to certain of the company s employees 
third  consulting  legal and accounting fees increased as a result of the company s entrance into the financial markets  the increased level of operational sophistication and of the company s reporting obligations under applicable securities laws 
finally  travel and entertainment costs increased as a result of expenses associated with financing  manufacturing  selling  and marketing activities 
net other income was  for the year ended december   compared with net other income of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the difference in net other income between said periods relates mainly to interest earned on funds on deposit 
net interest income varies in direct proportion to the amount of funds on deposit 
the company anticipates that net interest income during will be greater than net interest income during because the amount of funds on deposit is expected to increase 
liquidity and capital resources to date  the company has financed its operations principally through private placements of equity securities  proceeds from the exercise of common stock options  and advanced royalties and a development fee received under the license agreement 
the company generated  and  in net proceeds through financing activities from inception through december  and in  respectively 
the company used net cash in operating activities of  during the year ended december  as of december   the company s liabilities totaled  which included  in deferred royalty revenues relating to the license agreement 
the company had working capital as of december  of  the company s working capital and other capital requirements for the foreseeable future will vary based upon a number of factors  including the costs to complete development and bring the extresafe r medical needle withdrawal technology  intravenous flow gauge  blood collection device and other products to commercial viability  and the level of sales of and marketing for the safety cradle r sharps containers and extresafe r lancet strip 
at december   the company had committed to spend approximately  during on automated assembly equipment 
the company believes that existing funds  the million payment from bdit under the license agreement  development fees from j j under the j j agreement  license fees and funds generated from sales  will be sufficient to support the company s operations and planned capital expenditures through see years ended december   and the company may  however  raise additional funds through a subsequent public or private offering if  in the opinion of management  the company is in need of additional funding 
there is no assurance that any such offering will be completed or that  if completed  the terms of such offering will be favorable to the company 
at march   the company had  series a warrants   series b warrants   series d warrants and  other warrants the shpi warrants outstanding which are exercisable for the same number of shares of common stock of the company at per share in the case of series a warrants and per share in the case of series b warrants  series d warrants and shpi warrants 
in the event that the closing price of the common stock for any ten consecutive trading days exceeds per share  and subject to the availability of a current prospectus covering the underlying stock  the company may redeem the warrants 
the series a  b and d warrants expire on the earlier of a two years from the date of effectiveness of a registration statement under the act covering the sale of the shares of common stock underlying such warrants  which period shall be extended day for day for any time that a prospectus meeting the requirements of the act is not available  or b the redemption date if such warrants are redeemed subject to the right of the holder to exercise the warrants within days of notice of such redemption 
the shpi warrants expire on december  the exercise of all the warrants would result in an equity infusion to the company of  the company presently intends to redeem the warrants when and if the necessary conditions are met 
the series a and b warrants were issued in july and august  and a registration statement covering the resale of the shares of common stock underlying the series a and b warrants became effective on july  the series d warrants were issued in december  january and february a registration statement covering the resale of the shares of common stock underlying the series d warrants and shpi warrants has not been filed 
as of the date hereof  no warrants have been exercised and there can be no assurance that any warrants will ever be exercised 
on september   the company adopted a non qualified stock option plan nqsop which  as amended  authorizes the company to grant options to purchase up to  shares of common stock 
all nqsop options must be granted at exercise prices at least equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant 
as of march   the company had granted stock options to purchase  shares of common stock under the nqsop 
the exercise of all the stock options issued under the nqsop would result in an equity infusion to the company of  in addition to the options outstanding under the nqsop  there are  options outstanding that were issued under shp s non qualified stock option plan the shp nqsop 
these options became obligations of the company pursuant to the terms of the acquisition 
the exercise of these stock options will result in an equity infusion to the company of  in  the company entered into an agreement with a former director  the president and a vice president of the company  whereby these individuals have the opportunity to receive up to an aggregate of  additional shares of common stock 
these individuals have the right to divide the earn out shares among themselves or their assigns  if earned  based on performance  contributions to the company and or other factors relating to the business success of the company 
any issuance of earn out shares would be based upon the level of pre tax consolidated net income  adjusted to exclude any expense arising from the obligation to issue or the issuance of the earn out shares and any income or expense associated with non recurring or extraordinary items as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles adjusted ptni 
at the date the earn out shares agreement was adopted  the value of the common stock was per share 
at december   the company s common stock closed at 
the earn out shares have not vested 
no dividends will be paid on the earn out shares unless and until they vest 
the earn out shares will vest as follows 
if adjusted ptni for equals or exceeds  then an aggregate of  earn out shares will be issued  but only one issuance of  earn out shares will be made based on the  level of adjusted ptni 
if adjusted ptni for equals or exceeds  then there will be issued that aggregate number of earn out shares calculated by subtracting the number of earn out shares previously issued or issuable if any from  provided that only one issuance of earn out shares will be made based on the  level of adjusted ptni 
if adjusted ptni for equals or exceeds  then there will be issued that aggregate number of earn out shares calculated by subtracting the number of earn out shares previously issued or issuable if any from  provided that in no event will an aggregate of more than  earn out shares be issued 
in addition  upon purchase  take over or change in control of the company in a hostile or friendly transaction in  all of earn out shares shall become vested 
the company expects that the issuance of earn out shares will be deemed to be the payment of compensation to the recipients and will result in a charge to the earnings of the company in the year the earn out shares are earned  in an amount equal to the fair market value of the earn out shares 
this charge to earnings could have a substantial negative impact on the earnings of the company in the year in which the compensation expense is recognized 
as a result  the board is working with a compensation consulting firm to discuss equitable modifications to the earn out program to address this matter and expect to make changes with respect thereto 
on march   the company completed a private placement wherein it raised gross proceeds of  through an offering of units to accredited investors for per unit 
each unit consisted of shares of common stock and five series c warrants 
in january  the company completed the january private placement wherein it raised gross proceeds of  through an offering of units to accredited investors for per unit 
each unit consisted of one share of common stock and one series d warrant 
pursuant to requirements of the january private placement  the company provided each march private placement investor with the opportunity to exchange the securities purchased in the march placement for a number of units the investor could have purchased in the january private placement had the investment been made under the january private placement terms rather than the march terms 
in february  all of the march investors elected to convert to the january private placement terms 
as a result of the conversion  all outstanding series c warrants were canceled and the company issued  additional shares of common stock and  additional series d warrants 
pursuant to the requirements of the january private placement  dr 
gale h 
thorne released the company from certain future royalty obligations and the company issued to dr 
thorne and his assigns  shpi warrants 
the company also issued  shares of common stock and  series d warrants to a unaffiliated financial advisor in connection with the january private placement 
at present  shp and zerbec are equal owners of qic  but zerbec has an option to acquire two thirds of shp s current fifty percent interest in qic for one dollar because certain funding objectives were not met 
the parties are in the process of negotiating an arrangement so that the zerbec option will be eliminated or its exercise will be subject to substantial restriction 
no assurance can be given  however  that an agreement will be reached that eliminates or materially restricts the exercise of the zerbec option or that if such agreement is reached that it will be on terms that are favorable to the company 
the company estimates that between  and  in new funding will be required by qic for it to achieve its objectives 
inflation the company does not expect the impact of inflation on operations to be significant 
year management is in the process of determining whether all of the company s accounting and operational systems are year compliant 
management does not expect the costs associated with any required conversions of systems to ensure year compliance to be in excess of  forward looking statements when used in this form k  in filings by the company with the sec  in the company s press releases or other public or stockholder communications  or in oral statements made with the approval of an authorized executive officer of the company  the words or phrases would be  will allow  intends to  will likely result  are expected to  will continue  is anticipated  estimate  project  or similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date made  are based on certain assumptions and expectations which may or may not be valid or actually occur  and which involve various risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to risk of product demand  market acceptance  economic conditions  competitive products and pricing  difficulties in product development  commercialization  and technology  changes in the regulation of safety health care products  and other risks 
furthermore  manufacturing delays may result from additional mold redesigns or delays may result from the failure to timely obtain fda approval to sell future products 
in addition  sales and other revenues may not commence as anticipated due to delays or otherwise 
if and when product sales commence  sales may not reach the levels anticipated 
as a result  the company s actual results for future periods could differ materially from those anticipated or projected 
unless otherwise required by applicable law  the company does not undertake  and specifically disclaims any obligation  to update any forward looking statements to reflect occurrences  developments  unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statement 
other factors the company is subject to certain other risk factors due to its development stage status  the industry in which it competes and the nature of its operations 
these risk factors include the following 
history of losses profitability uncertain 
the company is in the development stage and has reported losses each year since at december   it had an accumulated deficit of  the company s products are in various stages of production  pre production  development and research 
the company has made only limited sales of its sharps container products and the extresafe r lancet strips  the only products it was selling as of december  sales of the company s safety cradle r sharps container products commenced in march pursuant to the bdsds distribution agreement 
limited commercial sales of the extresafe r lancet strip  which the company is producing manually until automated production equipment was put in place in november  also commenced in march there is no assurance that the company s products will be commercially viable and no assurance can be given that the company will become profitable 
in addition  prospects for the company s profitability will be affected by expenses  operational difficulties and other factors frequently encountered in the development of a business enterprise in a competitive environment  many of which factors may be unforeseen and beyond the company s control 
need for additional funds 
due to the development stage status of the company and the uncertainty of future profits  the report of independent public accountants relating to the company s audited financial statements  attached hereto  contains a going concern explanatory paragraph 
see consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the company believes that its existing funds  the million payment from bdit under the license agreement to be received in april  license fees and funds generated from sales will be sufficient to support the company s operations and planned capital expenditures through december  the company s future need for capital will depend on a number of factors  including the rate at which demand for products expands  the level of sales and marketing activities for the safety cradle r sharps container and extresafe r lancet strip products  and the level of expenditures needed to develop and commercialize the extresafe r medical needle withdrawal technology  intravenous flow gauge  blood collection devices  and the imaging technology 
moreover  the company s business plans may change or unforeseen events may occur which affect the amount of additional funds required by the company 
if additional funds are not obtained if and when required  the lack thereof could have a material adverse effect on the company 
further  there is no assurance that the terms on which any funds obtained by the company will be favorable to stockholders of the company at that time 
manufacturing strategy dependence on single manufacturers 
the company intends to subcontract the manufacture of certain of its products 
this strategy could result in various problems that could have a materially adverse effect on the company 
further  the company may not be able to arrange for the manufacture of its products through other companies which could delay sales and result in increased expenses if the company establishes its own manufacturing capability 
this could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s safety cradle r sharps containers and extresafe r lancet strip are its only products currently available for sale 
the safety cradle r sharps containers are produced by a single manufacturer 
the company has made arrangements for the manufacture of the extresafe r lancet strip to be performed by a single manufacturer 
if one of the company s manufacturers fails to perform its obligations in a timely and satisfactory manner  or if there is a change in the company s manufacturers  it could have a material adverse effect on the company 
there can be no assurance that the company would be successful in replacing its current manufacturers on terms favorable to the company 
also  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in finding additional manufacturers to manufacture future products on favorable terms 
negative pricing pressures on the company s safety products 
prices for the company s safety products may be higher than for competing conventional products which are not designed to provide the safety protection afforded by the company s products 
the company s prices  however  are expected to be competitive with those of competing safety products 
continuing pressure from third party payors to reduce costs in the health care industry as well as increasing competition from safety products made by other companies  could adversely affect the company s selling prices 
reductions in selling prices could adversely affect operating margins if the company cannot achieve corresponding reductions in manufacturing costs 
rapidly changing technology 
the company is in various stages of production  pre production  development and research with respect to its safety cradle r sharps containers  extresafe r lancet strip  extresafe r medical needle retraction technology  intravenous flow gauge  blood collection devices  filmless digitized imaging technology and other products 
there is no assurance that development of superior products by competitors or changes in technology will not eliminate the need for the company s products 
the introduction of competing products using different technology could adversely affect the company s attempts to develop and market its products 
potential lack of market acceptance 
the use of safety medical products  including the company s products  is relatively new 
the company s products may not be accepted by the market and their acceptance will depend in large part on i the company s ability directly or through its marketing partners to demonstrate the operational advantages  safety  efficacy  and cost effectiveness of its products in comparison with competing products and ii its ability to distribute its products through major medical products companies 
there can be no assurance that the company s products will achieve market acceptance or that major medical products companies will sell the company s products 
dependence on continued research and development 
the extresafe r medical needle withdrawal technology  intravenous flow gauge  phlebotomy device and imaging technology are still in various stages of development 
the company is also exploring additional applications for all of its products 
the continued development of its products and development of additional applications and new products is important to the long term success of the company 
there can be no assurance that such applications or products will be developed or  if developed  that they will be successful 
dependence on patents and proprietary rights 
the company s future success depends in part on its ability to protect its intellectual property and maintain the proprietary nature of its technology through a combination of patents and other intellectual property arrangements 
there can be no assurance that the protection provided by patents  if issued  will be broad enough to prevent competitors from introducing similar products or that such patents  if challenged  will be upheld by the courts of any jurisdiction 
patent infringement litigation  either to enforce the company s patents or defend the company from infringement suits  would be expensive and  if it occurs  could divert company resources from other planned uses 
any adverse outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on the company 
patent applications filed in foreign countries and patents in such countries are subject to laws and procedures that differ from those in the united states 
patent protection in such countries may be different from patent protection under us laws and may not be as favorable to the company 
the company also attempts to protect its proprietary information through the use of confidentiality agreements and by limiting access to its facilities 
there can be no assurance that the company s program of patents  confidentiality agreements and restricted access to its facilities will be sufficient to protect the company s proprietary technology 
ability to manage expanding operations 
the company intends to pursue a strategy of rapid growth although there can be no assurance that any growth will be achieved 
the company plans to significantly expand its product lines and to devote substantial resources to support operations  research and development  marketing and administrative functions 
there can be no assurance that the company will obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity on favorable terms  arrange for the marketing and distribution of its products  attract qualified personnel or effectively manage expanded operations 
the failure to properly manage growth could have a material adverse effect on the company 
competition potential inability to compete 
the company is engaged in a highly competitive business and will compete directly with firms that have longer operating histories  more experience  substantially greater financial resources  greater size  more substantial research and development and marketing organizations  established distribution channels and that are better situated in the market than the company 
the company s competitors and potential competitors include baxter international  inc  becton dickinson and company  devon industries  inc sage products  inc  surgicutt  inc  miles  inc  diagnostic corporation  boehringer mannheim  inc  sherwood medical company  inc 
and terumo medical corporation 
see business competition 
such competitors may use their economic strength to influence the market to continue to buy their existing products 
the company does not have an established customer base and is likely to encounter a high degree of competition in developing a customer base 
one or more of these competitors could use their resources to improve their current products or develop new products that may compete more effectively with the company s products 
new competitors may emerge and may develop products which compete with the company s products 
no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in competing in this industry 
product liability 
the sale of medical devices entails an inherent risk of liability in the event of product failure or claim of harm caused by product operation 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be subject to such claims  that any claim will be successfully defended or  if the company is found liable  that the claim will not exceed the limits of the company s insurance 
the company s current insurance coverage is in the amount of million per occurrence and million in aggregate 
there is no assurance that the company will maintain product liability insurance on acceptable terms in the future or that such insurance will be available 
product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on the company 
uncertainty in the health care industry 
the health care industry is subject to changing political  economic and regulatory influences that may affect the procurement practices and operations of health care facilities 
during the past several years  the health care industry has been subject to increased government regulation of reimbursement rates and capital expenditures 
among other things  third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and reimbursement levels for health care products and procedures 
because prices of the company s products may exceed the price of conventional products  the cost control policies of third party payors  including government agencies  may adversely affect use of the company s products 
the company believes that the costs associated with accidental needlesticks  however  exceed the procurement costs of safety products such as those of the company 
there are numerous proposals to reform the us health care system and the health care systems of various states 
many of these proposals seek to increase government involvement in health care  lower reimbursement rates  contain costs and otherwise change the operating environment for the company s prospective customers 
health care providers may react to these proposals and the uncertainty surrounding such proposals by curtailing or deferring investments in new technology and new products  including those of the company 
the company cannot predict what impact  if any  such proposals or health care reforms might have on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
management dependence on key personnel board 
the success of the company depends upon the skills  experience and efforts of its management and other key personnel 
should the services of one or more members of its present management or other key personnel become unavailable to the company for any reason  the business of the company could be adversely affected 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to retain existing employees or attract new employees of the caliber needed to achieve the company s objectives 
the company has noncompetition agreements in place with its key personnel 
the board currently consists of five members  four of whom are employed by the company 
market volatility 
market prices of securities of medical technology companies are highly volatile from time to time 
the trading price of the company s securities may be significantly affected by factors such as the announcement of new product or technical innovations by the company or its competitors  proposed changes in the regulatory environment  or by other factors that may or may not relate directly to the company 
sales of substantial amounts of common stock including stock which may be issued upon exercise of warrants or stock options  or the perception that such sales may occur  could adversely affect the trading price of the common stock 
no assurance of dividends 
the company has never paid dividends on its common stock 
the payment of dividends  if any  on the common stock in the future is at the discretion of the board and will depend upon the company s earnings  if any  capital requirements  financial condition and other relevant factors 
the board does not intend to declare any dividends on the common stock in the foreseeable future 
limitations on director liability 
the company s certificate of incorporation provides  as permitted by delaware law  that a director of the company shall not be personally liable to the company or its stockholders for monetary damages for any action or failure to take any action  with certain exceptions 
these provisions may discourage stockholders from bringing suit against a director for breach of duty and may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation brought by stockholders on behalf of the company against a director 
in addition  the company has agreed and its certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide  for mandatory indemnification of directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law and it has entered into contracts with its directors and officers providing for such indemnification 
anti takeover provisions of certificate and bylaws 
the certificate of incorporation of the company provides for the division of the board into three classes substantially equal in number 
at each annual meeting of stockholders one class of directors is to be elected for a three year term 
amendments to this provision must be approved by a two thirds vote of all the outstanding stock entitled to vote  the number of directors may be changed by a majority of the entire board or by a two thirds vote of the outstanding stock entitled to vote 
meetings of stockholders may be called only by the board  the chief executive officer or the president of the company  and stockholder action may not be taken by written consent 
these provisions could have the effect of i discouraging attempts at non negotiated takeovers of the company which may provide for stockholders to receive a premium price for their stock or ii delaying or preventing a change of control of the company which some stockholders may believe is in their interest 
effect of the issuance of preferred stock 
the company has an authorized class of preferred stock  shares of which may be issued with the approval of its board on such terms and with such rights  preferences and designations as the board may determine 
issuance of additional series of preferred stock  depending upon the rights  preferences and designations thereof  may have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in control of the company 
in addition  certain anti takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law  among other things  may restrict the ability of stockholders to effect a merger or business combination or obtain control of the company and may be considered disadvantageous by some stockholders 
management of the company presently does not intend to issue any shares of preferred stock 
preferred stock may  however  be issued at some future date which stock might have substantially more than one vote per share or other provisions designed to deter a change in control of the company 
the issuance of such stock to a limited group of management stockholders may vest in such persons absolute voting control of the company  including  among other things  the ability to elect all of the directors  control certain matters submitted to a vote of stockholders and prevent any change in management despite their performance
