item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section presents management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of first united corporation and subsidiaries collectively  the corporation including first united national bank trust the bank  and oakfirst life insurance corporation 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements which appear elsewhere in this report 
on january   the board of directors declared a stock dividend to shareholders on record at march   paid march  the dividend resulted in the issuance of  shares 
earnings and dividends per share have been restated to reflect the stock dividend 
on july   as part of the corporation s capital plan  the board of directors authorized the corporation s officers to repurchase up to of its outstanding common stock 
purchases of the corporation s stock under this program were completed in brokered transactions or directly from the corporation s market makers 
the repurchased stock was retired as required by maryland law 
as of december    shares were repurchased and retired under the plan authorized by the board of directors 
earnings analysis overview the corporation s net earnings for increased to million  or over the million reported for earnings for the year represent a record level of performance for the corporation  exceeding the previous record of million achieved in return on average assets was   and in   and  respectively 
the return on average shareholders equity for increased to from the reported in the return on average equity was in the earnings per share increased to in from in  compared with in during the first and second quarter of the company engaged the services of alex sheshunoff management services  inc  a highly respected financial consulting group  to facilitate a process improvement program 
based on the recommendations of the alex shesunoff management group  inc  and the vision of the executive management  several positions in the organization were changed  new positions were created  and a few positions were eliminated 
all employees were offered a severance package during the restructuring process  and employees chose to accept this package 
throughout this process first united national bank trust maintained its tradition of no lay offs affecting its employees 
for those employees accepting the voluntary severance package  the board of directors authorized a total of  to be charged against earnings during the first six months of forward looking statements the corporation has made certain forward looking statements with respect to this discussion 
such statements should not be construed as guarantees of future performance 
actual results may differ from forward looking information as a result of any number of unforeseeable factors  which include  but are not limited to  the effect of prevailing economic conditions  the overall direction of government policies  unforeseeable changes in the general interest rate environment  competitive factors in the marketplace  and business risk associated with credit extensions and trust activities 
these and other factors could lead to actual results which differ materially from management s statements regarding future performance 
net interest income the primary source of earnings continued to be net interest income the difference between interest income and related fees on earning assets  and the interest expense incurred on deposits and other borrowed funds 
this segment of earnings is affected by changes in interest rates  account balances and the mix of earning assets and interest bearing funding sources 
total interest income for increased over  from million to million  primarily due to growth in earning assets 
total interest expense at million represented an increase of from in this increase was the result of growth in our depository accounts as well as the effect of higher rates being paid 
the net effect of these changes was a improvement in net interest income to million in from million in this compares to million in the improvement in represents an increase of over s net interest income 
table analyzes the changes in net interest income attributable to volume and rate components 
for analytical purposes  net interest income is adjusted to a taxable equivalent basis 
this adjustment facilitates performance comparisons between taxable and tax exempt assets by increasing tax exempt income by an amount equal to the federal income taxes which would have been paid if this income were taxable at the statutorily applicable rate 
the taxable equivalent net interest margin decreased to in from in  compared with in table compares the components of the net interest margin and the changes occurring between  and allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is based on management s continuing evaluation of the quality of the loan portfolio  assessment of current economic conditions  diversification and size of the portfolio  adequacy of collateral  past and anticipated loss experience and the amount of non performing loans 
during  management continued to place emphasis on procedures for credit analysis  problem loan detection  and delinquency follow ups 
as a result of these efforts  the provision for credit losses in was million or of gross loans 
the provision for credit losses was 
and 
for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross charge offs for the years ended december    and totaled   and 
million  respectively 
table presents the activity in the allowance for loan losses by major loan category for the past five years 
table presents management s allocation of the allowance for loan losses by major loan catagory 
specific allocations in any particular category may be reallocated in the future to reflect current conditions 
accordingly  the entire allowance is considered available to absorb losses in any category 
other operating income non interest income for  at million  increased over the million earned in in  the corporation experienced an increase in income from insurance premiums  trust and fiduciary activities  service charges on depository accounts and real estate appraisal services 
the corporation and its subsidiaries continue to seek ways of obtaining additional other operating income 
throughout  the corporation implemented many new fee structures which should enhance income for years to come 
the growth in our nontraditional services mentioned above accounted for most of the increase of in non interest income over the million earned in other operating expense non interest expense increased million or from million in to million in as previously mentioned  first united had one time restructuring costs of 
million in  
million of which were related to severance payments to employees incurred during the first six months of other expenses contributing to the increase were costs to increase market awareness through various advertising campaigns  developing an office supply inventory  restructuring of a our data processing network  and expenses incurred in the closing of certain loan campaigns 
while some of these expenses will continue  others represent investments in future efficiencies 
the corporation incurred an increase of 
million in salary and employee benefits including the severance costs expense 
this increase can primarily be attributed to the 
million severance package as discussed above 
the corporation incurred a slight decrease in of 
million in occupancy expense of premises to 
million 
occupancy expense of premises was comparable at million and 
million in and  respectively 
expenditures to further increase the role of technology in improving the efficiency of customer service delivery and internal processing activities accounted for much of the increase in equipment expenses 
an expansion in the customer service center also contributed to an increase in equipment related expenses 
it is anticipated that the long run efficiencies gained by projects such as these will be a net benefit to the earnings performance of the corporation 
impact of year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the corporation s computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send customer statements  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the majority of the corporation s transaction processing is provided by a third party processor 
based on a recent assessment  the corporation determined that it and its third party processor will be required to modify or replace portions of its software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the corporation presently believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the corporation 
the corporation has initiated formal communications with all of its suppliers and third party processors to deter mine the extent to which the corporation s interface systems are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
the corporation s total year project cost and estimates to complete include the estimates costs and time associated with the impact of third party year issues based on presently available information 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the corporation s systems rely will be timely converted and would not have an adverse effect on the corporation s systems 
the corporation will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  and test the software for year modifications 
the corporation anticipates completing the year project within one year but not later than december   which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
the total cost of the year project is estimated at  and is being funded through operating cash flows 
costs attributable to the purchase of new software will be capitalized  and other costs will be expensed as incurred 
the costs of the project and the date on which the corporation believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
applicable income taxes applicable income taxes are detailed in note of the corporation s audited consolidated financial statements 
income tax expense amounted to million in as compared with million in and million in these amounts represented effective tax rates of   and for   and  respectively 
investment securities investment securities classified as available for sale are held for an indefinite period of time and may be sold in response to changing market and interest rate conditions as part of the asset liability management strategy 
available for sale securities are carried at market value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity net of income taxes 
investment securities classified as held to maturity are those securities that management has both the positive intent and the ability to hold to maturity  and are reported at amortized cost 
the corporation does not currently follow a strategy of making security purchases with a view to near term resales and therefore  does not own trading securities 
for additional information  see notes and to the corporation s audited consolidated financial statements 
total investment securties decreased million or in from million in to million in the corporation reported an decrease of million or during in its us treasury securities from million in to million in total obligations of state and political subdivision investments increased 
million or in to million as a result of efforts by management to extend the maturity of the portfolio and to obtain a higher yield 
the decline in investment securities was primarily due to the extraordinary loan growth experienced by the corporation in and the resulting liquity needs 
total investment securities were million as of december  the corporation manages its investment portfolios utilizing policies which seek to achieve desired levels of liquidity  manage interest rate sensitivity risk  meet earnings objectives and provide required collateral support for deposit activities 
excluding the us government and us government sponsored agencies  the corporation had no concentrations of investment securities from any single issues that exceeded of shareholders equity 
table exhibits the distribution  by type  of the investment portfolio for the three years ended december   and  respectively 
loan portfolio the corporation  through its bank  is actively engaged in originating loans to customers primarily in garrett  allegany  washington and frederick counties in maryland  mineral  hardy  berkeley and hampshire counties in west virginia and the surrounding regions of west virginia and pennsylvania 
the corporation has policies and procedures designed to mitigate credit risk and to maintain the quality of the corporation s loan portfolio 
these policies include underwriting standards for new credits and the continuous monitoring and reporting of asset quality and the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses 
these policies  coupled with ongoing training efforts  have provided an effective check and balance for the risk associated with the lending process 
lending authority is based on the level of risk  size of the loan and the experience of the lending officer 
table presents the composition of the corporation s loan portfolio 
the corporation s policy is to make the majority of its loan commitments in the market area it serves 
this tends to reduce risk because management is familiar with the credit histories of loan applicants  has an in depth knowledge of the risk to which a given credit is subject  and is familiar with the local economies 
the corporation had no foreign loans in its portfolio as of december during  gross loans increased million or to a total of million 
in comparison  gross loans at year end increased million or to a total of million as compared to the balances 
mortgage lending continued to be the primary source of loan growth in a portion of the mortgage growth includes a increase in our home equity product 
home equity loans increased from million from year end to million at year end we anticipate our home equity product to continue to expe rience growth as more of our customers look for tax advantages associated with this product 
small business loans also contributed to the overall growth of mortgage portfolio increasing million or by year end the corporation also experienced particularly strong growth in our installment portfolio 
the growth of the indirect install ment loan portfolio accounted for most of the million growth in installment loans 
managment believes this product line should continue to see growth for years to come 
table details the dollar amount and percentage distribution of the various key categories of credit in the loan portfolio 
funding for loan growth during and was provided by increased levels of deposits from within our market area as well as borrowings from federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb and our upstream correspon dent banks 
it is the policy of the corporation to place a loan in non accrual status whenever there is substantial doubt about the ability of a borrower to pay principal or interest on any outstanding credit 
management considers such factors as payment history  the nature of the collateral securing the loan and the overall economic situation of the borrower when making a non accrual decision 
non accrual loans are closely monitored by management 
a non accruing loan is restored to accrual status when principal and interest payments have been brought current  it becomes well secured or is in the process of collection and the prospects of future contractual payments are no longer in doubt 
at december   the corporation had 
million of non accrual loans 
table details the historical activity of non accural loans 
as of december   the corporation had million in loans for which payments were current  but the borrowers were experiencing financial difficulties 
the corresponding total for year end was million 
these loans are subject to ongoing management attention and their classifications are reviewed monthly 
deposit and other funding deposit liabilities increased to million in from million at the end of  or an increase of 
the million in deposit growth compares favorably to the million growth in deposits experienced in time deposits continue to be the main source of deposit growth during both and the corporation continues to experience strong competition for deposits from other commercial banks  credit unions  and the stock market and mutual funds 
table displays the average balances and average rates paid on all major deposit classifications for   and in addition to deposits  the corporation also has available a line of credit with the federal home loan bank fhlb of atlanta in an amount up to million 
the total borrowings from fhlb equaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
capital resources the bank and the corporation itself are subject to risk based capital regulations which were adopted by federal banking regulators and became fully phased in on december  these guidelines are used to evaluate capital adequacy  and are based on an institution s asset risk profile and off balance sheet exposures  such as unused loan commitments and stand by letters of credit 
the regulatory guidelines require that a portion of total capital be tier capital  consisting of common shareholders equity and perpetual preferred stock  less goodwill and certain other deductions 
the remaining capital  or tier capital  consists of elements such as subordinated debt  mandatory convertible debt  and grandfathered senior debt  plus the allowance for credit losses  subject to certain limitations 
under the risk based capital regulations  banking organizations are required to maintain a minimum for well capitalized banks total risk based capital ratio total qualifying capital divided by risk weighted assets  including a tier ratio of 
the risk based capital rules have been further supplemented by a leverage ratio  defined as tier capital divided by average assets  after certain adjustments 
the minimum leverage ratio is for banking organizations that do not anticipate significant growth and have well diversified risk including no undue interest rate risk exposure  excellent asset quality  high liquidity and good earnings 
other banking organizations not in this category are expected to have ratios of at least  depending on their particular condition and growth plans 
higher capital ratios could be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profile of a given banking organization 
in the current regulatory environment  banking companies must stay well capitalized in order to receive favorable regulatory treatment on acquisition and other expansion activities and favorable risk based deposit insurance assessments 
the corporation s capital policy establishes guidelines meeting these regulatory requirements  and takes into account current or anticipated risks and future growth opportunities 
on december   the corporation s total risk based capital ratio was  well above the regulatory minimum of 
the risk based capital ratios for year end and were and  respectively 
total shareholder s equity remained stable  dropping slightly from million at year end to million at year end the main reasons for the lack of growth are the corporation s participation in the stock buyback program and increases in the dividends paid to shareholders 
total shareholders equity at december  was million 
the equity to assets ratio at december   was  compared with and at year end and on july   as part of the corporation s capital plan  the board of directors also authorized the corporation s officers to repurchase up to of its outstanding common stock 
purchases of the corporation s stock under the program were completed in brokered transactions or directly from the corporation s market makers 
as of december    or shares have been repurchased and retired under the plan authorized by the board of directors

asset and liability management introduction the investment and funds management committee of the corporation seeks to assess and manage the risks associated with fluctuating interest rates while maintaining adequate liquidity 
this is accomplished by formulating and implementing policies that take into account the sources and uses of funds  maturity and repricing distributions of assets and liabilities  pricing strategies  and marketability of assets 
liquidity the objective of liquidity management is to assure that the withdrawal demands of depositors and the legitimate credit needs of the corporation s delineated market areas are accommodated 
total liquid assets  represented by cash  investment securities available for sale and held to maturity maturing within one year and loans maturing within one year  amounted to million  or of total assets at december  this compares with million  or of year end assets  and million  or of year end assets 
additional liquidity of million is available from unused lines of credit at various upstream correspondent banks and the fhlb of atlanta 
interest rate sensitivity interest rate sensitivity refers to the degree that earnings will be impacted by changes in the prevailing level of interest rates 
interest rate risk arises from mismatches in the repricing or maturity characteristics between assets and liabilities 
management seeks to avoid fluctuating net interest margin  and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
the corporation uses interest sensitivity gap analysis and simulation models to measure and manage these risks 
the interest rate sensitivity gap analysis assigns each interest earning asset and interest bearing liability to a time frame reflecting its next repricing or maturity date 
the differences between total interest sensitive assets and liabilities at each time interval represent the interest sensitivity gap for that interval 
a positive gap generally indicates that rising interest rates during a given interval will increase net interest income  as more assets than liabilities will reprice 
a negative gap position would benefit the corporation during a period of declining interest rates 
in order to manage interest sensitivity risk  management of the corporation formulates guidelines regarding asset generation and pricing  funding sources and pricing  and off balance sheet commitments 
these guidelines are based on management s outlook regarding future interest rate movements  the state of the regional and national economy  and other financial and business risk factors 
management uses computer simulations to measure the effect on net interest income of various interest rate scenarios 
key assumptions used in the computer simulations include cash flows and maturities of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities  changes in asset volumes and pricing and management s capital plans 
this modeling reflects interest rate changes and the related impact on net income over specified periods 
management does not use derivative financial instruments to effect its interest rate sensitivity 
at december   the static gap analysis prepared by management indicated that the corporation was liability sensitive over the next year 
in computing the effect on pre tax income of changes in interest rates  management has assumed that any changes would immediately effect earnings 
normally when an organization is liability sensitive there is a positive impact to income when interest rates decline 
the simulation analysis shown below shows a negative impact when interest rates decline or basis points 
management explains this affect due to the current position of interest rates  whereby certain liability accounts are currently priced at a level where management feels they cannot be reduced further in rate  therefore  the full impact of repricing liabilities in the declining rate environment is not realized 
based on the simula tion analysis performed at year end  the corporation estimates the following changes in income before taxes assuming the indicated interest rate changes basis point increase million basis point increase 
million basis point decline 
million basis point decline 
million this estimate is based on assumptions that may be affected by unforeseeable changes in the general interest rate environment and any number of unforeseeable factors 
rates on different assets and liabilities within a single maturity category adjust to changes in interest rates to varying degrees and over varying periods of time 
the relationships between prime rates and rates paid on purchased funds are not constant over time 
management can respond to current or anticipated market conditions by lengthening or shortening the corporation s sensitivity through loan repricings or changing its funding mix 
the rate of growth in interest free sources of funds will influence the level of interest sensitive funding sources 
in addition  the absolute level of interest rates will affect the volume of earning assets and funding sources 
as a result of these limitations  the interest sensitive gap is only one factor to be considered in estimating the net interest margin
