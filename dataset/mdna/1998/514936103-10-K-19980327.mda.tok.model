item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general overview the company reported improved operating earnings in and the company s primary business is the insurance of titles to real property  which is greatly influenced by the real estate economy 
during the three year period from to  the company benefited from the execution of three distinct portions of its business strategy 
operations were expanded through the acquisition of title insurance agents and underwriters  expenses were tightly monitored and controlled  and claims experience improved due to quality control efforts and an improved claims environment 
revenues the company s operating revenues are dependent on overall levels of real estate activity  which are influenced by a number of factors including interest rates  access to capital  housing starts  housing resales and the general state of the economy 
in addition  the company s revenues are affected by the company s sales and marketing efforts  its acquisition program and its strategic decisions based on the rate structure and claims environment in particular markets 
premiums and related fees are determined both by competition and by state regulation 
operating revenues from direct title operations are recognized at the time real estate transactions close  which is generally to days after the opening of a title order 
operating revenues from agents are recognized when the issuance of a policy is reported to the company by an agent 
although agents generally report the issuance of policies on a monthly basis  heightened levels of real estate activity may slow this reporting process 
this typically results in delays of to days from the closing of real estate transactions until the recognition of revenues from agents 
as a result  there can be a significant lag between changes in general real estate activity and their impact on the company s revenues 
in addition to the premiums and related fees  the company earns investment income from its portfolio of fixed maturity and equity securities 
investment income includes dividends and interest as well as realized capital gains or losses on the portfolio 
the company regularly reexamines its portfolio strategies in light of changing earnings or tax situations 
in the fourth quarter of the company shifted its investment strategy  eliminating its investment in equity securities and beginning to move the majority of its investment portfolio into fixed maturity securities 
the repositioning of the portfolio eliminated the exposure of the regulated surplus of the company s insurance subsidiaries to market fluctuations inherent in equity portfolios 
additionally  the commensurate increase in fixed maturity securities increased the level of more stable  predictable interest income earned 
factors affecting profit margins and pre tax profits the company s profit margins are affected by several factors  including the volume of real estate activity  policy amount and the nature of real estate transactions 
volume is an important determinant of profitability because the company  like any other title insurance company  has a significant level of fixed costs arising from personnel  occupancy costs and maintenance of title plants 
because premiums are based on the face amount of the policy  larger policies generate higher premiums although expenses of issuance do not necessarily increase in proportion to policy size 
profit margins are lower on refinancings than on sales due to premium discounts and higher cancellation rates generally experienced on refinancings 
cancellations affect profitability because costs incurred both in opening and in processing orders typically are not offset by fees 
the company s principal variable expense is commissions paid to independent agents 
the company regularly reviews the profitability of its agency revenues  adjusting commission levels or cancelling certain agents where profitability objectives are not being met and expanding operations where acceptable levels of profitability are available 
the company continually monitors its expense ratio net of interest and goodwill  which is the sum of salaries and employee benefits  agency commissions and other expenses expressed as a percentage of operating revenues 
claims generally  title insurance claim rates are lower than for other types of insurance because title insurance policies insure against prior events affecting the quality of real estate titles  rather than against unforeseen  and therefore less predictable  future events 
a provision is made for estimated future claim payments at the time revenue is recognized 
both the company s experience and industry data indicate that claims activity continues through years after the policy is issued 
management uses actuarial techniques to estimate future claims by analyzing past claim payment patterns 
management has continued to emphasize and strengthen claims prevention and product quality programs 
in the fourth quarter of the company made a change from reporting policy and contract claims on a discounted to an undiscounted basis 
this change was made to conform with industry practice and because it is considered preferable by rating agencies and investment analysts 
the effect of the change for was to increase the provision for policy and contract claims by million and decrease net income by million and net income per share by and net income per share assuming dilution by 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of the company changed its estimate of the ultimate net cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred through september  to reflect favorable experience 
under the company s reserving methodology  the provision for losses on policies issued in each year is based on historical experience determined over a period of years 
as a result  the very high incidence of losses on policies issued in the s had the effect of pushing up the rate at which losses were provided in the s 
the early s were also affected by a high volume of residential refinance business which time has proven is experiencing a lower incidence of losses 
the company began to see favorable development indications on the policy years as those years began to develop some meaningful experience  ie  years 
however  because title losses are paid over a long period of time and experience has shown that significant losses can be reported and paid more than years out  the company chose to proceed cautiously with respect to projecting its favorable experience over these early years to the projected ultimate losses for the subject policy years 
the company monitored development of these years very closely through and the first three quarters of and  while indications continued to be favorable for the policy years  the company as of september  did not believe that the limited development of those years was sufficient to justify a significant reduction in the projected ultimate losses for those years 
in the fourth quarter of  in connection with the performance of initial due diligence procedures related to the negotiation of the acquisition of commonwealth and transnation  the company had the opportunity to see how the experience of these two major title underwriters compared to its own experience 
the information gained from this experience along with extensive actuarial studies of the company s book of business resulted in a determination that the projected ultimate losses for certain policy year business should be reduced to give greater weight to the favorable development on those years through december  the effect of the change in estimate was to decrease the provision for policy and contract claims by million and increase net income by million and net income per share by and net income per share assuming dilution by 
both the change in reserve estimate and the change from discounting to not discounting reserves were contemplated by the company as a result of the shift in the business that now reflects a higher amount of refinance transactions and an increase in frequency of housing resales 
because the change in accounting principle to no longer discount policy and contract claims is inseparable from the change in estimate  both have been accounted for as a change in estimate 
accordingly  the net effect of the two changes  a decrease of million in the provision for policy and contract claims  has been included in operations for the fourth quarter of the above changes were both made to conform with general industry practice 
the changes are included in the provision for policy and contract claims  and no prior amounts have been restated 
other expenses the most significant components of other expenses are rent for office space  outside costs of title production  travel  communications and taxes levied by states on premiums 
seasonality historically  real estate activity has been generally slower in the winter months with volumes showing significant improvements in the spring and summer months 
the percentage of title orders closed to title orders opened is typically lower in the first six months than at year end because of this seasonal variance 
see business seasonality  backlog and cyclicality 
in recent years low levels of mortgage interest rates have caused fluctuations in real estate activity levels outside of the usual  seasonal pattern 
the company cannot predict whether or when the historical seasonal pattern of real estate activity will resume 
contingencies see item legal proceedings for a discussion of pending legal proceedings

in the fourth quarter of  the company changed its investment strategy  selling a majority of its equity portfolio and beginning to move the proceeds into fixed maturity securities

expenses salaries and employee benefits 
personnel related expenses are a significant portion of total operating expenses in the title insurance industry 
these expenses require management through the often rapidly changing conditions in the real estate economy 
salaries and employee benefits increased in compared to this increase was largely tied to higher business volumes  which necessitated increased staffing levels to meet customer service demands  incentive increases and normal merit raises 
the expense ratio improved in to from in salaries and employee benefits increased in over  and the expense ratio decreased to from in in the fourth quarter of  in response to a severe fall in order counts  a special staff and salary reduction program was implemented that lasted through the second quarter of on a same store basis  the company reduced its overall headcount by approximately from its peak level

general  administrative and other expenses 
the most significant components of other expenses are rent for office space  outside costs of title production  travel  communications and taxes levied by states on premiums

provision for policy and contract claims 
the company s claims experience has shown improvement in recent years 
the loss ratio was  and in  and  respectively 
as previously discussed  the company changed its method of reporting policy and contract claims in the fourth quarter of claims paid as a percentage of operating revenues were  and in  and  respectively 
income taxes the company pays us federal and state income taxes based on laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates 
the effective tax rates reflected in the income statement for  and differ from the us federal statutory rate principally due to non taxable interest  dividend deductions  travel and entertainment and company owned life insurance 
at december  the company had recorded gross deferred tax assets of million related primarily to policy and contract claims and employee benefit plans 
substantially all of this deferred tax asset balance could be realized in the future through the reversal of existing temporary taxable differences 
accordingly  it is more likely than not that the income tax benefits will be realized for all of the temporary deductible differences existing at december  the company reassesses the realization of deferred assets quarterly and  if necessary  adjusts its valuation allowance accordingly 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition to million of cash and invested cash on hand and million of fixed maturity securities at december   the company had no long term debt and maintained a million working credit facility  of which million was used at december  historically  the company has not maintained significant levels of debt 
upon closing the acquisition as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company incurred debt of million under the credit facility and issued million shares of series b preferred stock 
the company estimates that servicing the debt and preferred stock will require approximately million per year  which management expects to be funded largely from increased cash flow from operations resulting from the acquisition 
additionally  management believes that these cash requirements will be partially offset by approximately million of federal income tax benefits related to the tax deductibility of both interest expense  amortization of intangibles and amortization of tax reserve discount 
in view of the historical ability of the company and commonwealth transnation to generate strong  positive cash flows  and the projected strong cash position and relatively conservative capitalization structure of the company following consummation of the acquisition  the company believes that the company will have sufficient liquidity and adequate capital resources to meet both its short and long term capital needs 
further  the company expects to maintain approximately million in unused credit facilities 
emerging issues many existing computer programs use only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
these programs were designed and developed without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century 
if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results by or in the year the potential costs and uncertainties to companies in addressing this issue the year issue will depend on a number of factors  including their software and hardware and the nature of their industries 
companies must also coordinate with other entities with which they electronically interact  both domestically and globally  including suppliers  customers  creditors  borrowers and financial service organizations 
the company has closely examined the year issue and the potential costs and consequences to the company in addressing this issue 
as part of its business and growth strategy  the company is currently investing in new information technology  including the replacement of multiple independent personal computer systems throughout its direct operations with an upgraded centralized system  that is year compliant 
the software for such new centralized system is being developed by elliptus software solutions  inc  a lawyers title subsidiary that develops and markets title and escrow production software 
as development of such software is nearly complete  management believes that the remaining software development costs will not be material 
management estimates that the company s investment in hardware for the project will total approximately million over the next eighteen months 
the company is also communicating with third parties with which it does business to coordinate further action with respect to the year issue 
as a result  management believes that  with the replacement of certain computer systems as described above  the year issue is not expected to have a material impact on the company s operations and that the cost of the company s addressing the year issue is not a material event or uncertainty that would cause its reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating results or financial condition
