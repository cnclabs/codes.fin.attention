other issues the company is party to more than collective bargaining agreements with local unions representing approximately  of the company s employees 
during the company negotiated over labor contracts without any work stoppages 
typical agreements are to years in duration and  as agreements expire  the company expects to enter into new collective bargaining agreements 
there can be no assurance  however  that such agreements will be reached without work stoppage

no major union contracts will be negotiated in outlook the company s outlook for is positive 
statements below regarding the company s expectations  hopes  beliefs  intentions or strategies are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of while we believe that the statements are accurate  uncertainties and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements 
in particular 
the company s food store strategy is to invest in existing kroger markets or in areas adjacent to markets where the company has a strong franchise and can leverage marketing  distribution  and overhead dollars 
the company expects consistent sales and earnings increases from the existing store base combined with incremental sales and earnings contributions as a result of the capital investment program 

management believes that the combination store format and the company s geographic diversity are strategic advantages that will allow kroger to withstand continued competition from other food retailers  supercenters  mass merchandisers  and restaurants 

as new stores mature and capital spending levels off  the company expects to achieve increases in sales per average food store square foot 

the company continues to invest capital in technology to enhance kroger s distribution network in order to improve store operations  product procurement and distribution practices 
these initiatives  combined with increasing private label sales  are expected to have a favorable influence on the gross profit rate 

the company s goal is to further reduce operating  general and administrative expense rates 
increased sales volume combined with investments in new technologies and lower costs  while maintaining or improving customer service  should help achieve this goal 

the company currently expects net interest expense  estimated using year end rates  to total approximately million 
a increase in market rates would increase the estimated expense by approximately million 
a decrease in market rates would reduce the estimated expense by approximately million 

the company expects to increase retail food store square footage by approximately in both and in  the company plans to open or expand stores compared to in the company expects capital expenditures  including additional company owned real estate  logistics projects  and continuing technology investments  to total approximately million 
the company also expects to complete within the wall remodels of food stores 
the increased square footage is planned for existing company markets where the company has an established market position and an existing administrative and logistical network 

the company is currently working to resolve the potential impact of the year on the processing of date sensitive information by the company s computerized information systems 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in miscalculations or system failures 
based on current information  costs of addressing potential problems are not expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows in future periods 
however  if the company  its customers or vendors are unable to resolve such processing issues in a timely manner  it could result in a material financial risk 
accordingly  the company believes it has allocated the resources necessary to resolve all significant year issues in a timely manner 
inflationary factors  increased competition  construction delays  and labor disputes could affect the company s ability to obtain expected increases in sales and earnings 
delays in store maturity  increased competition and increased capital spending could adversely affect the anticipated increase in sales per square foot 
increases in gross profit rate may not be achieved if start up costs are higher than expected or if problems associated with integrating new systems occur 
increased operating costs and changes in inflationary trends  could prevent the company from reducing operating  general and administrative expenses  while new technologies could fail to achieve the desired savings and efficiencies 
net interest expenses could exceed expectations due to acquisitions  inflation  or increased competition 
the company s ability to achieve its construction goals could be hampered by construction delays  labor disputes  increase competition  delays in technology projects  and its ability to generate continued ebitd growth 
the inherent complexity of computer software and reliance on third party software vendors to interface with the company s systems could affect the completion of necessary year modifications
