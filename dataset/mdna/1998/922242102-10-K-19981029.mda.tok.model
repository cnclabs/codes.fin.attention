results of operations year ended july  compared to year ended july  net sales 
net sales for the fiscal year ended july  totaled  a decrease of  or from fiscal net sales of  decreases in volume and average selling prices with respect to the company s in line skate  athletic protective equipment  skateboards and scooter categories  offset to a lesser degree by increases in volume in the helmet and instant canopy categories  were the primary factors leading to the decline in total sales 
net sales were also adversely affected during fiscal by competitive pressures  which caused sales prices to decline in many of the company s product categories 
with respect to in line skates  gross sales for fiscal totaled  a decrease of approximately  or  compared to fiscal  as unit volume in fiscal totaled  units  a decrease of approximately  or 
the average price per unit gross revenues divided by units sold of the company s in line skates was approximately during fiscal  compared to for fiscal the decrease in in line skate sales was primarily due to a continuing industry wide decline in consumer demand compared to the prior year  as well as to the fact that kmart corporation  which accounted for of the company s gross sales for fiscal only accounted for for fiscal  and is no longer a major customer for the company s in line skates and skateboards 
gross sales for athletic protective equipment during fiscal totaled  a decrease of approximately  or  compared to fiscal  while unit volume in fiscal was  a decrease of approximately  or 
the company s sales of these products generally correlate with sales of in line skates  thus the decrease in sales of protective equipment also is primarily attributable to the factors discussed above 
gross sales of bicycle and recreational safety helmets during fiscal totaled  an increase of approximately  or  compared to fiscal  while unit volume increased approximately  or  to a total of  units during fiscal the increase in helmet sales is primarily due to the introduction of the new d recreational helmets during fiscal gross sales of skateboards and scooters during fiscal totaled  a decrease of approximately  or  compared to fiscal  on total volume of  units  a decrease of approximately  units  or 
the decrease is primarily due to a reduction in skateboard sales to kmart corporation of  between fiscal and fiscal  since kmart is no longer a major customer for this product category 
gross sales of snowboards and snowboarding accessories  such as bindings  leashes and miscellaneous apparel items  during fiscal totaled  an increase of approximately  or  compared to fiscal  while unit volume of snowboards increased approximately  or  to a total of  units during fiscal the increase in snowboard and snowboarding accessories sales is primarily due to the introduction of this product category to the major mass market merchandisers during fiscal gross sales of portable instant canopies totaled  during fiscal  which was the company s first full year in the category 
gross sales for fiscal totaled  the company sold a total of approximately  quik shade r instant canopies in compared to approximately  in the prior year  with the major portion of sales primarily due to the company opening a national program in the home improvement distribution market 
sales to the company s four largest accounts  each of which is a major mass market merchandiser  represented of the company s gross sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the decrease is the result of several factors including the deletion of kmart corporation during the year as a major customer for the company s in line skates and skateboards 
this decrease in sales was partially offset by the addition of the home depot  which was not one of the company s four largest accounts  as a significant customer for the quik shade r canopy 
by product category  in line skates  athletic protective equipment and helmets accounted for  and  respectively  of the company s total gross sales during fiscal  compared to  and  respectively  during fiscal skateboards and scooters accounted for of the company s total gross sales during fiscal  compared to during fiscal portable instant canopies represented of total gross sales during  compared to in the prior year 
snowboards and snowboarding accessories represented of total gross sales during fiscal  compared to in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit for the fiscal year ended july  decreased by  compared to the fiscal year ended july   representing a decrease 
the company s gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal  compared with in fiscal the increase in gross margin percentage is due to several factors  including the impact of the addition to the sales product mix of quik shade canopies which had a higher margin  as well as lower product costs as a result of beneficial sourcing during fiscal  the effects of higher than usual amounts of close out sales during fiscal and the decrease in sales to kmart corporation during fiscal which had a positive impact on the company s gross margin due to the pricing structure for kmart 
there can be no assurance that the company can continue to obtain its products from suppliers at sufficiently low costs to fully offset the downward pressure on sales prices in order to sustain or improve present gross profit margins 
operating expenses 
the company s operating expenses consisting of selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses for fiscal totaled  or of net sales 
operating expenses for fiscal were  or of net sales 
selling and marketing expenses decreased by  or  to  for fiscal compared to fiscal selling and marketing expenses for fiscal amounted to of net sales  compared to in the prior year 
the decrease in amount and as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to decreased advertising expenses for co op programs with certain of the company s major customers as a result of the elimination or reduction of certain advertising programs that were fixed dollar allowances  or replacement of such programs with volume based programs 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  for fiscal compared to fiscal general and administrative expenses for fiscal amounted to of net sales  compared to in fiscal the dollar increase is primarily due to non cash consulting expenses of  recognized in connection with the company entering into consultation agreements  and issuing stock warrants as compensation under the agreements  with remy capital partners iv  lp  a private investment partnership remy and raymond h 
losi  the company s co founder and former chairman of the board 
as compensation under these agreements  remy and mr 
losi received warrants to purchase  and  shares  respectively  of the company s common stock 
excluding such consulting expenses  the company s general and administrative expense for fiscal decreased  or compared to fiscal  due primarily to minor changes in various expenses 
during fiscal the company recognized an impairment loss of  for write downs of fixed assets and a write off of the remaining unamortized balance of goodwill relating to the snowboard operations of its wholly owned subsidiary  static snowboards  inc static s operating losses and the continuing challenges facing the snowboard industry in general led to the conclusion that impairment of the subsidiary s assets had occurred 
in fiscal  the company sold certain assets of static  resulting in no significant gain or loss  and closed its manufacturing facility with the intention of sourcing snowboards from independent contractors located in asia 
other income expense 
other income for the fiscal year ended july  was  an increase of  or  compared to fiscal this increase is due to a decrease in interest expense of  resulting from no short term borrowings during fiscal compared to fiscal  as well as an increase in interest income of  due primarily to a change during the year in the investment of marketable securities from lower yielding tax exempt securities to higher yielding taxable securities  of which was invested in high yield bond funds  compared to fiscal provision for benefit from income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for fiscal consists of the valuation allowance established against the prior year net deferred tax asset 
no tax benefit was recorded for the fiscal net operating losses due to either the non deductibility of certain charges included in the net operating loss or the uncertainty of realizing the tax benefits of such losses under statement of financial accounting standard no 
accounting for income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate and provision benefit from income taxes in fiscal differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to interest income  some of which is exempt from federal income taxes due to the nature of the investments from which it is derived

for the quarter  sales of in line skates  athletic protective equipment  skateboards and scooters  and snowboards and snowboarding accessories were down   and  respectively  while helmets and portable instant canopies increased and  respectively  in comparison to the fourth quarter of the prior year 
these fluctuations were due to similar factors as discussed above in the year over year comparisons for each of these product categories 
the company s net loss for the quarter ended july  was  or per share  compared with a net loss of  or per share for the corresponding period of the prior year 
the decrease in loss is primarily due to an increase in gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales of as a result of a higher margin sales product mix for the quarter ended july  versus the quarter ended july   and decreased advertising expenses for co op programs as discussed above in the year over year comparisons 
year ended july  compared to year ended july  net sales

the average price per unit gross revenues divided by units sold of the company s in line skates was approximately during fiscal  compared to for fiscal the decrease in in line skate sales was primarily due to heavy inventory levels at retail throughout much of the year  as well as an industry wide decline in consumer demand for in line skates in general compared to prior year 
these factors  as well as the influences of strong competition in the mass market  in turn led to continued significant pricing pressures within the category during the year 
gross sales for athletic protective equipment during fiscal totaled  a decrease of approximately  or  compared to fiscal  while unit volume in fiscal was  a decrease of approximately  or 
the company s sales of these products generally correlate with sales of in line skates  thus the decrease in sales of protective equipment also was primarily attributable to the factors discussed above 
additionally  consumer preferences within the market have led to substantially all of the company s sales of protective equipment now being made via multiple unit packages  usually triple packs containing three pairs of equipment one pair each of knee pads  elbow pads and wrist guards which yields less total revenue than sales of separate single unit packages 
gross sales of bicycle and recreational safety helmets during fiscal totaled  a decrease of approximately  or  compared to fiscal  while unit volume decreased approximately  or  to a total of  units during fiscal these decreases in comparison with the prior year were primarily due to continued high inventory levels at the retail level  increased competition and pricing pressures within the category and less safety awareness programs and legislation designed to promote helmet use by bicyclists 
the year over year decrease in gross sales was greater as a percentage than the decrease in unit volume due to discounting and other price reductions in response to competitive pressures in the marketplace 
the average price per unit for the company s helmets was approximately during fiscal  compared to during fiscal competition and high inventory levels put downward pressure on retail and wholesale prices throughout the industry 
gross sales of skateboards and scooters during fiscal totaled  an increase of approximately  or  compared to fiscal  on total volume of  units  an increase of approximately  units  or 
a resurgence in the demand for skateboards began during fiscal and carried through the first half of fiscal  with momentum then slowing in the latter half of the year as more inventory became available at retail and a greater proportion of the company s shipments represented customer re orders

gross profit 
gross profit for the fiscal year ended july  decreased by  compared to the fiscal year ended july   representing a decrease 
the company s gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal  compared with in fiscal the decrease in gross margin was due primarily to the price reductions mentioned above  particularly within the in line skate and helmet categories and the effects of higher than usual amounts of close out sales during the year 
surplus inventory and increased competition in the mass market  again principally with respect to in line skates and safety helmets  had an impact upon the company s gross margin 
operating expenses 
the company s operating expenses consisting of selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses for fiscal totaled  or of net sales 
operating expenses for fiscal were  or of net sales 
selling and marketing expenses decreased by  or  to  for fiscal compared to fiscal selling and marketing expenses for fiscal amounted to of net sales  compared to in the prior year 
the increase as a percentage of net sales was due to several factors  including increased advertising expenses for co op programs with certain of the company s major customers and increases in other marketing related expenses such as for trade shows  catalogs and promotional materials  particularly with respect to the company s snowboard operations  and the increased percentage that these types of expenses  as well as corporate sales and marketing salaries  represented upon a lower sales base 
in dollars  these increases were more than offset by decreases in sales commissions because of the decline in sales during the year 
general and administrative expenses decreased by  or  to  for fiscal compared to fiscal general and administrative expenses for fiscal amounted to of net sales  compared to in fiscal the dollar decrease was primarily due to decreases in legal and other professional fees  expenses associated with the company s defined benefit pension plan  donations and other expenditures resulting from management s enhanced efforts to control administrative costs  offset in part by increases in expenses associated with the first full year of the company s new snowboard operations 
other income expense 
other income for the fiscal year ended july  was  an increase of  or  compared to fiscal this increase was due to a decrease in interest expense of  resulting from a decrease in the level of short term borrowings under the company s line of credit  as well as an increase in interest income of  due to higher balances of marketable securities and other investments during fiscal compared to the prior year

liquidity and capital resources since its initial public offering  the company funded its activities principally from cash flow generated from operations and credit facilities with institutional lenders 
in june  the company completed an initial public stock offering  issuing a total of  new common shares which raised approximately  in proceeds to the company  net of fees and expenses 
a portion of these proceeds was used by the company to pay off borrowings on its line of credit and for other working capital purposes 
the remainder was invested in marketable securities 
the company has a credit agreement with a major bank providing a million revolving line of credit  for the issuance of commercial letters of credit 
the agreement  which expires december   is unsecured 
the agreement requires that the company satisfy certain financial covenants 
over the past several years  borrowings have varied  typically reaching highest levels in the pre christmas periods 
however  more recently the company has borrowed against its line of credit less frequently due to the ability to finance operations internally from cash and marketable securities available for sale 
balances on the line of credit are classified as current liabilities on the company s balance sheet 
cash and marketable securities available for sale totaled  as of july   compared to  as of july  net working capital as of july  was  compared to  as of july   and the company s current ratio was as of july   compared to as of july  these fluctuations are primarily due to cash used in and generated from operations  particularly via increases and decreases in inventory and increases in and collections of accounts receivable  that result in daily fluctuations in short term investments 
the company had no long term debt as of july  and the company had net stockholders equity of  as of july   compared to  as of july   with such decrease due primarily to operating results for the fiscal year ended july   as well as fluctuations in unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities investments 
management believes that inflation has not had a significant impact upon the company s costs and prices during the past three fiscal years 
capital expenditures for fiscal totaled  compared to  during fiscal the decrease is primarily due to significantly less machinery and equipment expenditures for the snowboard manufacturing facility and for production molds than made in the prior year 
of the fiscal total  approximately  represented machinery and equipment expenditures for the snowboard plant and  represented production molds compared to  and  respectively  for such expenditures during the prior year 
sales and disposals of property and equipment for fiscal totaled  with approximately  due to the closure of the static snowboards  inc manufacturing facility and sale of the majority of the snowboard manufacturing assets 
future liquidity and financial position the company intends to continue to focus upon building and maintaining its existing product lines  including its new line of quik shade r instant canopies 
the company also plans to continue to devote resources toward the pursuit and development of new products 
in addition  management continues to explore the possibility of making selected acquisitions of other companies or products which would offer a strategic fit with the company s existing products and its sourcing and distribution channels in the mass market 
the company also is considering expanding international distribution and developing additional distribution arrangements in order to take further advantage of growth opportunities which management believes exist for its products outside the united states 
management believes that its current cash position  funds available under existing banking arrangements  and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the company s presently projected cash and working capital requirements for the next fiscal year assuming continued financial performance at present levels 
foreign exchange management does not believe that the fluctuation in the value of the dollar in relation to the currency of its suppliers has in the last three fiscal years had any significant material and adverse impact on the company s ability to purchase products at agreed upon prices 
typically  the company and its suppliers negotiate prices in us dollars and payments to suppliers are also made in us dollars 
nonetheless  there can be no assurance that the value of the dollar will not have an impact upon the company in the future 
additional factors that could affect operating results the following factors  together with other risk factors discussed in the overview section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other information contained elsewhere herein  should be considered carefully in evaluating the company and its business 
reliance on major customers 
in the past three fiscal years  the company has had several customers which accounted for a majority of the company s sales 
as is customary in the industry  the company does not have long term contracts with any of its customers 
the loss of  or a reduction in business from  any of its major customers could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  because a large percentage of the company s accounts receivables are due from the major customers  the failure of any of them to make timely payments with respect to its account could have a material and adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
kmart corporation  which accounted for of the company s gross sales for fiscal  is no longer a major customer for the company s in line skates and skateboards 
however  due to the pricing structure for kmart corporation  this event had a positive impact on the company s gross margin for fiscal on the other hand  the company has added the home depot as a new significant customer for its quik shade r instant canopy 
the company believes that the home depot could become a major customer in the future 
however  the company does not have a long term contract with the home depot and  accordingly  there can be no assurance that the home depot will become a major customer of the company for the balance of fiscal or thereafter 
competition from other manufacturers developers of products  price sensitivity of customers 
the company operates in a highly competitive environment and there are no significant technological or manufacturing barriers to entry 
while the company believes that the principal competitive factors in its market are price  quality of product  brand recognition  accessibility and customer service  the company s primary customers  mass merchandisers  are extremely price sensitive 
as a result  the company must continually monitor and control its costs while refining its products to maintain its market position 
there can be no assurance that the company can continue to provide its products at prices which are competitive or that it can continue to design and market products that appeal to consumers even if price competitive 
many of the company s current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  larger customer bases  greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial  marketing and other resources than the company 
in addition  smaller retailers may be acquired by  receive investments from or enter into other commercial relationships with larger  well established and well financed companies 
the company also competes to a lesser degree with manufacturers of specialty or premium priced products 
the company s primary competitors in the mass market include first team sports  inc skate attack  roller derby cas  seneca and certain models from rollerblade  inc blade runner 
in the case of athletic protective equipment  franklin sports is the company s primary competitor in the mass market 
bell sports corp 
bell and bsi  protective technologies  inc pti and troxel pro action are the primary competitors in the bicycle safety helmet mass market 
for instant canopies  a new category introduced in  the company s primary competitors are international e z up  inc and kd kanopy  inc 
in addition  the company may compete with its primary customers when such customers directly source products that the company sells 
at present  the company believes that its products in each category  when compared to competitors products of comparable quality  are currently offered at comparable or lower prices than most or all of its competitors 
however there can be no assurance that other companies  whether new enterprises or established members of the retail or sporting goods industries  will not be able to develop products of comparable or higher quality at lower prices  or that the company s price structure will not be affected by future circumstances 
shifting and uncertain consumer demand 
the company must continually anticipate the emergence of  and adapt its products to  the popular demands of consumers 
in the past  a substantial amount of the company s net sales have been generated by sales of in line skates  skateboards and athletic protective equipment 
since then the company has developed other product lines  including safety helmets  snowboards and portable canopies 
no assurance can be given  however  that consumer demand for these products in general or the company s products in particular will continue into the future 
a reduction in the demand for these products could have a material and adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
quik shade r is a line of instant portable canopies recently introduced by the company 
no assurance can be given that the market for these instant canopies will continue or that the company s product offerings in this market will become or remain competitive 
also in fiscal  static snowboards  inc  the company s wholly owned subsidiary  experienced operating losses  primarily due to the continuing challenges facing the snowboard industry in general 
accordingly  an impairment loss totaling  representing the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value of assets  was recognized during the second quarter for write downs of fixed assets and write off of the remaining unamortized balance of goodwill relating to such subsidiary 
during the assets of the static manufacturing operation were sold and the manufacturing plant was closed  with the intention of sourcing snowboards from independent contractors 
reliance on foreign suppliers to source the company s products 
the company s products are primarily sourced from suppliers located in asia with whom the company does not have long term contractual agreements 
if the company were unable to develop and maintain relationships with suppliers that would allow it to obtain sufficient quantities of merchandise on acceptable commercial terms  its business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
moreover  the company may not be able to obtain its products and supplies on substantially similar terms  including cost  in order to sustain its operating margins 
although management presently believes that other suppliers could be obtained in such instances  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to obtain products and supplies on substantial similar terms  including cost  in the future 
in addition  purchasing products from foreign suppliers subjects the company to the general risks of doing business abroad 
these risks include potential delays in shipment  work stoppages  adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates  changes in import duties and tariffs  changes in foreign regulations and political instability 
a significant portion of the company s products  including various models of its in line skates  are manufactured in mainland china  which trades with the united states under a most favored nation mfn trade status 
while the company believes that alternative manufacturing sources could be found  maintaining existing costs will depend upon these products continuing to be treated under mfn tariff rates 
from time to time  the us has threatened to rescind mfn tariff rates and impose trade sanctions on certain goods manufactured in china 
to date  no such sanctions have been imposed that have affected the company or its products  however there can be no assurance with regard to the possible imposition of sanctions in the future 
in addition  the current market crisis in asia may have a material and adverse impact upon the company s ability to procure products from suppliers 
however  the company may be able to move production quickly to alternate sources in response to economic or political circumstances that might arise in any particular country 
product liability claims  insurance 
due to the nature of its products  the company is subject to product liability claims  including claims for serious personal injury or death 
coverage is on a claims made basis  and is subject to certain deductibles 
although the company believes that it has adequate liability insurance for risks arising in the normal course of business  including product liability insurance with respect to all of its products  there can be no assurance that insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover one or more large claims or that the applicable insurer will be solvent at the time of any covered loss 
further  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain insurance coverage at acceptable levels and cost in the future 
successful assertion against the company of one or a series of large uninsured claims  or of one or a series of claims exceeding any insurance coverage  could have a material and adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
trademarks and proprietary rights 
there are risks inherent in the design and development of new products and product enhancements  including those associated with patent issues and marketability 
potential liability from patent and other intellectual property infringements can have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
more specifically  in march  the company was served with two lawsuits entitled i mark c 
carter and international ez up  inc v 
variflex  inc and service merchandise co  inc 
case no 
wjr rnbx in the united states district court for the central district of california in los angeles and ii james p 
lynch and kd kanopy  inc v 
variflex  inc 
civil action no 
d in the united states district court of colorado 
the first complaint i alleges  among other things  that the company s quik shade r product infringes a patent owned by plaintiff and used in a competing instant set up  collapsible canopy product and ii prays for unspecified monetary damages  treble damages  punitive damages  costs and attorney s fees  an injunction and the destruction of all allegedly infringing products 
the second complaint i alleges that the company s quik shade r product infringes two patents owned by the plaintiff and ii prays for an accounting  general damages  treble damages  an injunction and costs and attorney fees 
the company has filed an answer in both lawsuits denying the allegations of the complaints and has filed counterclaims in both lawsuits seeking declarations of patent invalidity and non infringement as to the plaintiffs patents  as well as damages against the plaintiffs for alleged antitrust violations 
in september  the company received a demand for defense and indemnification of service merchandise company  inc in that action entitled mark c 
carter  et 
al 
v 
service merchandise company  inc  case no 
c dlj enb in the united states district court for the northern district of california 
the complaint in this action is virtually identical to the complaint against service merchandise in the above referenced action by carter in the central district of california in los angeles 
the company has agreed to indemnify and defend service merchandise which is a retailer of the company s product in this action 
the company and service merchandise filed an answer to the complaint on behalf of service merchandise in the central district of california los angeles action 
in october  counsel for the company and service merchandise plan to move to dismiss the northern district of california oakland action based on another action pending  or  in the alternative  to transfer it to the central district of california in los angeles 
these lawsuits are in an early stage 
the company believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims alleged in the complaints and intends to conduct a vigorous defense 
the company also intends to vigorously pursue its counterclaims 
an unfavorable outcome in the above matters could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business prospects and financial condition 
in addition  even if the ultimate outcome in both cases is resolved in favor of the company  the defense of such litigation may involve considerable costs  which could be material  and could divert the efforts of management  which could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
with respect to the company s own patents  service marks  trademarks  trade secrets and similar intellectual property  the company considers such proprietary rights as critical to its success  and relies on patent and trademark law  trade secret protection and confidentiality and or license agreements with its employees  customers  partners and others to protect its proprietary rights 
the company holds or has pending certain design patents and employs various trademarks  trade names  including its own logos  in the packaging and advertising of its products 
the company has registered the variflex r and static r trademarks in the united states  and has secured a worldwide watch to alert the company to any unauthorized use in any other parts of the world 
registration of various other trademarks of the company s products are pending 
however  effective patent  trademark  service mark and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which the company s products and services are made available 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary rights will be adequate or that third parties will not infringe or misappropriate the company s patents  trademarks and similar proprietary rights 
in addition  there can be no assurance that other parties will not assert infringement claims against the company 
the company has been subject to claims and expects to be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time in the ordinary course of its business  including claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by the company 
such claims  even if not meritorious  could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources 
year many computer programs were designed and developed utilizing only two digits in date fields  thereby creating the inability to recognize the year or years thereafter 
beginning in the year  these date codes will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
this year issue creates risks for the company from unforeseen or unanticipated problems in its internal computer systems as well as from computer systems of third parties on which the company s systems and operations rely 
failures to address the year issue could result in system failures and the generation of erroneous data 
the company is currently working to resolve the potential impact of the year on the processing of date sensitive information by the company s computerized information systems 
the company has been advised by its outside information systems consultant that the company s primary information management hardware and software systems have been thoroughly tested and verified to be year compliant 
the company believes that its secondary personal computer based information systems will require hardware and software updating prior to january  at an estimated cost of approximately  this program is targeted for completion by the end of fiscal the company believes that it does not have any significant non information technology embedded systems that require year assessment 
the company is contacting its primary suppliers  customers and other third party providers of significant services to determine that they have a program in place to address year issues and to monitor their progress 
the initial contacts should be completed by december  the company presently believes that the year problem will not pose a significant operational problem to the company 
however  there can be no assurance that the systems of other parties upon which the company s business also relies  including but not limited to the company s customers and suppliers  will be converted on a timely basis 
the company s business  financial condition  or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the failure of its systems or those of other parties to operate or properly manage dates beyond risks associated with entry into new business areas 
the company may choose to expand its operations by developing and promoting new or complementary products  expanding the breadth and depth of products and services offered or expanding the acquisition of new or complementary businesses  products or technologies  although it has no present understandings  commitments or agreements with respect to any material acquisitions or investments 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to expand its efforts and operations in a cost effective or timely manner or that any such efforts would increase overall market acceptance 
furthermore  any new business or product line launched by the company that is not favorably received by consumers could damage the company s reputation or the variflex r brand 
expansion of the company s operations in this manner would also require significant additional development and operations expenses and would strain the company s management  financial and operational resources 
the lack of market acceptance of such efforts or the company s inability to generate satisfactory revenues from such expanded businesses or products to offset their cost could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s performance is substantially dependent on the continued services and on the performance of its senior management and other key personnel  particularly raymond jay h 
losi ii  who has entered into an employment agreement with the company 
the loss of mr 
losi ii could have a material and adverse effect on the company 
although the company carries a  life insurance policy on mr 
losi ii  no assurance can be given that the proceeds will be sufficient to protect against such a loss 
the company s performance also depends on the company s ability to retain and motivate its other officers and key employees 
the loss of the services of any of its executive officers or other key employees could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
other than the aforementioned exceptions  the company has long term employment agreements with only a few of its key personnel 
the company s future success also depends on its ability to identify  attract  hire  train  retain and motivate other highly skilled technical  managerial  merchandising  marketing and customer service personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully attract  assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel 
the failure to retain and attract the necessary technical  managerial  merchandising  marketing and customer service personnel could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
consumer regulation of company products 
certain of the company s products are subject to regulation by the federal consumer products safety commission the cpsc  and may therefore be subject to recall request by the cpsc 
although the company is not aware of any current proceeding by the cpsc which would result in the recall of the company s products  any such proceeding could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations
