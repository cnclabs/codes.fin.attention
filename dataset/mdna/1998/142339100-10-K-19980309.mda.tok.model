item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
carlisle companies incorporated carlisle or the company sales grew to billion in  up  or million  from sales of billion 
this increase is due to the expansion of product lines and market shares of carlisle s core businesses and the integration into existing operations of several acquisitions made in in  net earnings reached million  or per share of common stock  a increase over net earnings of million  or per share 
this increase in earnings is attributable to the higher sales level  and the improved operating margins resulting from our continued focus on manufacturing and distribution costs 
in  sales increased  or million  due to continued growth in core businesses  as well as acquisitions made in and to the full year effect of acquisitions made in net earnings increased  or million  in reflecting both the increased sales levels and reductions in costs 
although not having a significant effect on this year s sales or earnings  a record number of acquisitions were completed in throughout the year we acquired several small bias ply tire and wheel manufacturing and distributing companies  which extend both our product offerings and geographic distribution of tire and wheel assemblies to lawn and garden  trailer and other original equipment manufacturers 
these transactions were as follows i the city machine wheel company  ii the neilson wheel company  inc  iii conestoga tire rim inc  iv wheeltech north america  inc  and v tilden corporation 
in april  we purchased overland brakes  inc  a small spring brake manufacturing company  complementing our heavy duty friction products 
in december  we purchased zimmerman brush co  a small  privately owned manufacturer of brushes for the janitorial and sanitation market 
also in december  we signed letters of intent to purchase hardcast europe  a dutch manufacturer of specialty adhesive and sealant products for the european construction market  and to establish a joint venture with lander plastics  a british manufacturer of plastic automotive components 
the hardcast europe acquisition was completed in january in addition  we completed the following divestitures in i in february  we divested the remaining operations of carlisle engineered metals incorporated  a metal roofing company and  ii in october  we sold braemar  inc  a small manufacturer of medical monitoring devices 
several acquisitions made in were integrated into carlisle during these acquisitions include the following i insul foam  inc  which brought new technology to the epdm rubber roofing market  ii intero  inc and unique wheel  inc  manufacturers of steel and aluminum wheels and rims  iii scherping systems  inc and scherping controls  inc  companies that design and manufacture in plant processing equipment for the cheese industry  iv hartstone  inc  which designs and manufactures ceramic tableware  and v the engineered plastics division of johnson controls  inc  which manufactures highly engineered plastic components for the automotive industry 
operating segments construction materials segment sales declined by to million in  as a slight increase in sales of the ongoing business was offset by the effect of the divestiture of the remaining assets of carlisle engineered metals 
the earnings of million in this segment were up over earnings of million  reflecting improving margins from a changing product mix  improved warranty results and the elimination of losses due to the divestiture of the metal roofing company 
the sales of million reflect an increase of over sales of million 
an jump in over earnings is attributable to the increased sales levels and improved operating margins 
transportation products segment sales reached million in   or million  over sales of million 
the sales level is an increase of  or million over the level 
the increases in sales reflect the full year effect of the consolidation of the engineered plastics division of johnson controls  acquired in october  with geauga company to form carlisle engineered products  inc  which supplies highly engineered plastic  rubber and metal components to the automotive industry 
also contributing to the sales growth in this segment are the continued robust sales of aircraft wire  increased direct sales of refrigerated containers  penetration of additional channels of distribution of heavy duty friction products to the aftermarket  and increased sales of specialty trailers to construction markets 
the sales increase reflects record sales gains from all operations  and  to a lesser extent  companies acquired in and operating earnings in this segment climbed  or million  to million 
this increase reflects the higher level of sales of components to the automotive industry  aircraft wire and specialty trailers  as well as increased margins due to improved manufacturing processes in the specialty trailer business and especially in the refrigerated container business 
general industry segment sales grew  or million  to million in this increase is primarily due to internal growth of tire and wheel assemblies  plastic foodservice products and in plant processing equipment through expanding our market shares of current products and extending existing products to new markets 
the full year effect of acquisitions made in and acquisitions made in account for approximately of the increase in sales in this segment 
in  sales in this segment increased  or million  to million  reflecting both growth in internal businesses and acquisitions 
operating earnings in this segment in increased  or million  to million  reflecting the higher level of sales 
segment earnings in were million  a or million increase over earnings 
the increase in sales results from the contribution of the specialty wheel businesses of intero and unique wheel acquired in march and from market share gains in the lawn and garden  trailer and golf car markets 
financial results total costs  which include raw material  manufacturing  selling  general and administrative costs  expressed as a percentage of total sales  continued to decline in to of sales  down from of sales in in  these costs were percent of sales 
this decline in total costs reflects an ongoing focus on improving purchasing  manufacturing and distribution of products throughout all carlisle operations 
gross margins  expressed as a percent of sales  represent what is left after costs of purchasing raw materials and of manufacturing products ie  cost of goods sold are subtracted from sales 
these margins declined from of sales in to in and in while operations across all segments maintained consistent gross margins generally  this decline largely reflects the changing mix in carlisle s total sales 
in  operations with lower gross margins  but also with lower corresponding selling  general and administrative costs  represent greater proportions of total carlisle sales 
selling and administrative costs  expressed as a percent of sales  declined from in to in and in reflecting both disciplined cost control throughout all operations and the increasing proportion of activities with lower cost structures in carlisle s overall sales 
interest expense increased to million in from million in and million in  due to the increasing level of debt used to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures and relatively constant interest rates 
income taxes  for financial reporting purposes  have remained constant at an effective rate of of earnings before tax in  and  generally reflecting stable federal and state tax rates 
taxes are discussed more completely in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable were million  an increase of over the level of million 
this increase is consistent with a higher level of sales  partially offset by an increasing portion of sales from businesses that require a lower investment in accounts receivable  and an ongoing effort to manage receivables at all operations 
the level of accounts receivable represent a increase over  and is primarily attributable to acquisitions made during the year 
inventories  valued primarily by the last in  first out lifo method  were million at year end  a increase over year end level of million 
approximately one third of this increase is due to acquisitions made during the year  while normal seasonal buildup  strong demand and backlogs at most operations explain the remaining two thirds 
the year end inventory level increased million over levels  or  due primarily to acquisitions made during the year 
capital expenditures totaled million in  a significant increase over level of million 
this increase is primarily attributable to investments in injection molding and blow molding equipment to meet growth opportunities in carlisle s automotive components operation 
additionally  other significant projects in include plant and equipment to manufacture tpo roofing membranes  additional warehousing space for finished specialty tire and wheel assemblies and epdm roofing products  increased production capacity of heavy duty friction products  increased capacity to produce tufflite tm wire and in plant processing equipment for the food and pharmaceutical industries 
in  the major projects include equipment to produce a pressure sensitive tape line for epdm rubber roofing systems  presses and tire building machines for a specialty tire plant in trinidad  and cable wrapping equipment for tufflite tm wire 
liquidity  capital resources and environmental cash flows provided by operating activities were million in  a slight decline from million in this decline is primarily due to higher levels of inventories offsetting increases in net earnings and depreciation and amortization charges to earnings 
cash flows from operating activities were million in cash used in investing activities was million  a decrease from the level of million  resulting from lower levels of acquisitions in partially offset by the increased level of capital expenditures 
in  the cash used in investing activities was million  which includes acquisition expenditures of million 
the net cash provided by financing activities in was million  which reflects increases in debt offset by dividend payments and stock repurchases 
the cash provided by financing activities of million in was essentially due to increases in debt financing 
carlisle has a million revolving credit facility available for acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
in january  carlisle issued to the public million of ten year bonds at a rate of 
the net proceeds from these bonds were used to repay amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility and to fund other needs throughout the company s primary sources of liquidity and capital are cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity 
carlisle continues to maintain substantial flexibility to meet anticipated needs for liquidity and capital investment opportunities 
carlisle management recognizes the importance of the company s responsibilities toward matters of environmental concern 
programs are in place to monitor and test facilities and surrounding environments and  where practical  to recycle materials 
carlisle has not incurred any material charges relating to environmental matters in or in prior years  and none are currently anticipated 
the company has remediation programs in place for its systems that are not currently year compliant 
the total cost of compliance is not expected to have a material impact on the company s operations  liquidity or capital resources 
however  we are unable to predict all the implications of the year issue as it relates to our customers  suppliers and other entities 
backlog and future outlook backlog was million at december  compared to million in this increase in backlog reflects stronger positions at all major operations within the company  especially in the container manufacturing operation 
our companies have developed consistent strategies to grow their businesses both internally and through acquisitions 
in  carlisle continued to increase market shares  improve manufacturing processes and target new markets with expanded products to complement the company s core strengths 
with a record backlog  management is confident that our ongoing commitment to these proven strategies will yield favorable results in accounting pronouncement in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no
