although the percentage of the company s advertising budget allocated to the renewal product line has decreased  the company has begun aggressively marketing renewal s money saving benefit over disposable alkaline batteries and performance advantage over rechargeable nickel cadmium batteries and has lowered the prices of the recharger system for renewal 
in addition  the company is focused on growing renewal s market share by expanding distribution into new channels such as electronics specialty stores and other speciality retailers in the domestic market

see note q to notes to consolidated financial statements 
year the company has established a year project the year project designed to remediate the impact of the year issue on its hardware and software systems as well as other business processes 
project 
the company s year project addresses four major areas core information technology it business systems including hardware and application software  other it infrastructure systems including hardware and application software  non it systems including facilities  production  research and development  and special purpose computer systems  and external providers of materials or services 
the project involves inventories of systems or services evaluation of compliance prioritization of non compliant systems or services and remediation and testing involving repair or replacement of non compliant systems or services 
state of readiness 
the company s legacy core it business systems are generally not year compliant and would require substantial resources to make them so 
core it systems for north america are being replaced by an integrated information system purchased from sap that is year compliant 
this system is being implemented primarily to achieve operational efficiencies and  in addition  addresses year issues 
the selection and procurement phase was completed in september the compliant hardware necessary to operate sap was installed in january the sap software was configured by november and will be gradually tested and implemented over the succeeding six months  with conclusion of the implementation expected by mid the process is being assisted by consulting services from sap personnel 
core it systems for european operations are being modified with final testing scheduled for december other it infrastructure systems running support functions are generally current technology although certain software applications will require upgrading or replacement 
hardware for such systems is normally leased with all existing leases of potentially non compliant equipment expiring on or before september compliant replacements are being obtained continuously as the leases expire 
software for such systems is being inventoried and evaluated by third party specialists 
this inventory and evaluation process is expected to be complete by february with remediation expected by mid non it systems  such as systems to manage buildings heating cooling  security  etc  manufacturing systems equipment involved directly in the manufacture of products and research and development systems prototype production  etc 
are generally not materially affected by the year issue 
some support systems  ie equipment involved indirectly in the manufacture of products monitoring  testing  etc 
require remediation 
non it systems were inventoried and evaluated as of september remediation of non compliant systems is occurring with the assistance of an outside consultant 
key systems are expected to be compliant by march   with other systems compliant by mid the company currently expects to identify the state of year compliance of all key suppliers by mid at that time  the company will seek to replace any key non compliant suppliers with alternate year compliant suppliers 
see contingency plans 
products manufactured and or distributed by the company do not utilize programmable logic to function and thus are not affected by year issues 
costs to address year issues 
expenditures directly related to identification  evaluation and remediation of year exposures were million for fiscal with additional expenditures of million projected for fiscal these costs are not expected to be material to the company s financial position 
capital expenditures for projects undertaken for operational efficiencies but which also addressed year issues primarily sap amounted to million for fiscal  million for fiscal with additional expenditures of million projected for fiscal other expenditures associated with these capital expenditures were million in fiscal  million in fiscal with additional expenditures of million projected for fiscal risk of year issues 
the timing of a year related disruption would coincide with a seasonal low in the company s business cycle and thus have less impact on the business than it otherwise would during other parts of the cycle 
the company estimates the most reasonably likely worst case year scenarios as follows a portion of non core it systems experience temporary disruption 
such disruption is not expected to have a material impact on the company s ability to function 
a portion of manufacturing operations experience temporary disruption 
such disruption is not expected to have a material impact on the company s ability to function 
a minor portion of the customer base experiences disruption 
such disruption could result in a temporary slight reduction in sales however  this reduction is not readily quantifiable 
a portion of the supplier base experiences disruption 
contingency plans 
although the company has not yet developed a contingency plan for each of the various most reasonably likely worst case scenarios noted above  the company would respond to these scenarios respectively above as follows and a contingency plan will be developed if the perceived risk increases 
it is expected that normal safety stock levels would cover such a scenario 
the company will determine the appropriate level based on business conditions and perceived risk 
unrelated to year  the company maintains alternate suppliers in the event of disruption of supply of a material or resource 
it is expected that it could source from alternates until the normal supplier were back on line
