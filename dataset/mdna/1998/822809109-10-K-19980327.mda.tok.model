the company believes that cash flows from operations coupled with the funds available from anticipated third party financing and cash balances at december   will be sufficient to satisfy its contemplated cash requirements for at least months 
the company s expansion strategy is dependent upon obtaining third party financing and achieving projected cash flow from operations 
the third party financing may include  but is not limited to  traditional lending sources such as bank lines of credit  equipment leasing  and or restaurant sale leaseback arrangements that may be available to the company 
the company currently has access to a  line of credit to finance restaurant equipment 
the company from time to time utilized mortgage financing with various banks as necessary to facilitate expansion 
in the event that the company s plans change or its assumptions prove to be inaccurate due to unanticipated expenses or construction or other delays or difficulties or otherwise  third party financing or projected cash flow otherwise prove to be insufficient to fund operations and fully implement the company s expansion strategy  the company could be required to seek additional financing from sources not currently anticipated or reduce its expansion plans 
there can be no assurance that third party financing will be available to the company when needed  on acceptable terms  or at all 
the company has  of principal indebtedness due in as well as a maximum of  of shells inc preferred share repurchases which are expected to be repaid out of the company s cash flow from operations 
quarterly fluctuation of financial results the restaurant industry in general is seasonal  depending on restaurant location and the type of food served 
the company has experienced fluctuations in its quarter to quarter operating results due to various factors  including the seasonal nature of its business  weather conditions in florida and the health of florida s economy in general and the tourism industry in particular 
the company s restaurant sales are generally highest from january through april and june through august  the peaks of the florida tourism season  and generally lower from september through mid december 
seasonality at the company s restaurants is magnified due to their present concentration in florida and  in many cases  locations are in coastal cities  where sales are significantly dependent on tourism and its seasonality patterns 
it is anticipated that implementation of the company s expansion program into the midwest markets will  over time  partially reduce some of the existing seasonal fluctuations 
in addition  quarterly results have been  and in the future are likely to be  substantially affected by the timing of new restaurant openings both in and outside of florida 
because of the seasonality of the company s business and the impact of new restaurant openings  results for any quarter are not generally indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year on an annualized basis and cannot be used to indicate financial performance for the entire year 
year issue the company s computer systems  both hardware and software  were designed in recent years  and concerns relating to the year issue have generally been addressed at initial development 
the company intends to continually review both its systems and the systems of its vendors relative to year compliance during and at this time  the company does not believe the year issue will present a material event or uncertainty relative to the company s ability to operate its business 
impact of inflation and price changes the company has not operated in a highly inflationary period and its management does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on sales or expenses 
as expenses increase  the company expects to recover increased costs by increasing prices  to the extent permitted by competition 
due to the fact that the company s business is somewhat dependent on tourism in florida  any significant decrease in tourism due to inflation would likely have a material adverse effect on revenues and profitability
