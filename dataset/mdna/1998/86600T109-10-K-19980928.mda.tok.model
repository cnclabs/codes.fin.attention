year the company has focused on year with an inside out approach and has completed a survey to guide the process 
the primary focus has been on information systems is compliance 
upon examination of our current systems  we have determined that the is area is nearly compliant 
we have achieved compliance through replacement of systems 
management believes that existing capital budgets are adequate for any remaining hardware and software replacements 
we have purchased our host ibm rs  model j  and have upgraded our ibm rs  model j in addition  we have added a backup disk system that is also yk compliant 
our new version of the aix operating system is also compliant 
our relocation to nashville  tennessee  has helped in our compliance efforts by requiring the replacement of key network equipment 
since the move  we have upgraded approximately of our computer systems to compliant windows nt systems 
additionally  we have replaced our pbx and voice response system  both of which are compliant 
finally  we have upgraded our aspect callcenter software and server 
the only outstanding year issues surround our www web server and a software program utilized by human resources 
thus  from an internal standpoint  shop at home is now more than yk compliant 
we plan to establish a year committee by november  this committee will focus on businesses external to shop at home 
the focus of the committee will be on systems and service suppliers that are electronically linked to the company s business units 
the company has provided many major vendors with an edi software package which is yk compliant and the company is not presently aware of any material problems in the year compliance plans of its major vendors or service providers  however  the committee will focus on risk analysis in relation to our credit card processor or other possible non compliant vendors 
a contingency plan will be established by june in the event that these service providers do not meet the compliance deadline 
despite the concern surrounding discussions of year  the company does not anticipate major interruptions 
the development and testing of a contingency plan will help to ensure this 
the company believes its yk program is adequate to detect in advance compliance issues  and that the necessary resources to remedy them are available 
however  the year problem has many aspects and potential consequences  some of which are not reasonably foreseeable  therefore  there can be no assurance that unforeseen consequences will not occur
