item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general rfm designs  develops  manufactures and markets a broad range of rf components and modules for the low power component  virtual wire r short range radio device system  frequency control module and filter product areas 
the company s products are based on saw technology  and the company s strategy is to leverage its rf design skills and its packaging technology to provide saw based solutions to the current and emerging needs of the electronics industry 
the company s products include more than resonators  filters  high frequency clocks  oscillators  and transmitter and receiver modules 
the company s average selling prices within these product lines generally range from 
to for low power products components and radio systems  to for frequency control modules and to for filter products 
during fiscal and the first two quarters of fiscal  the company constructed and tested its new surface mount technology smt manufacturing facility 
the purpose of the facility is to provide the capability to manufacture products utilizing surface mount packaging in a highly automated environment 
during this period  the facility had not reached production status  so the related equipment was not placed into service  and certain associated costs were capitalized as start up costs 
the related costs were included in property and equipment as construction in progress 
in the third quarter of fiscal  this facility achieved production status  accordingly  depreciation on the equipment and amortization of capitalized start up costs began 
except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section  as well as in the sections entitled business  legal proceedings and selected financial data in this report 
results of operations the following discussion relates to the financial statements of the company for the fiscal year ended august  current year or fiscal  in comparison to the fiscal year ended august  prior year or fiscal  as well as the fiscal year ended august  fiscal 
in addition  there is discussion of the financial statements for the three months ended august  fourth quarter  in comparison to the three months ended august  comparable quarter of the prior year 
the following table sets forth  for the years ended august the percentage relationship of certain items from the company s statements of income to total sales and the percentage change in these items from year to year percentage of sales year to year change to to sales cost of sales gross profit research and development sales and marketing general and administrative litigation total operating expenses income from operations other income expense  net income before income taxes income tax expense net income sales the following table sets forth the components of the company s sales and percentage relationship of the components to total sales for the periods indicated year ended august  amount of total amount of total amount of total dollars in thousands product sales low power components    short range radio devices    frequency control modules    filters    total product sales    technology development sales total sales    sales increased in fiscal  due to increased demand for each of the company s four product lines 
sales increased in fiscal due to increases in three of the company s product lines 
low power component sales increased in fiscal and in fiscal  due to an increase in number of units sold in both periods  particularly to automotive customers 
this was despite a decrease in average selling prices due to the competitive markets in which these products are sold 
the company believes that the markets for its low power component products is approximately million and is growing in terms of unit volume 
these markets have attracted a number of large international competitors  particularly for the automotive segment 
the increased competition has resulted in lower average selling prices in many cases 
the company believes that the impact of lower average selling prices may be significant enough in future periods to offset the impact of selling an increased number of units 
there can be no assurance that sales for low power components will continue to increase  or even stay at the same level they have been in previous periods 
the company continues to devote a considerable amount of its capital  technical  sales and marketing resources to the virtual wire r short range radio device products 
sales for these products have increased in both fiscal years and  due to an increase in the number of units sold for these products 
the latest product offering in this product family  is the transceiver module  a fully integrated short range radio device module 
the transceiver module offers robust operation  small size  low power consumption and low costs for short range wireless data applications 
in addition  the company believes this product will match applications being identified by the home rf working group  sponsored by intel and hp  and bluetooth consortium  sponsored by ericsson and nokia 
the company believes this product group provides an opportunity to exploit its proprietary technology and pursue its strategy of focusing on value added products 
the timing of when any sales resulting from such new applications reach the production phase is dependent upon the timing of both the customers product development cycles and their product introduction cycles 
it is difficult to project if  and when  these new products will have a significant impact on the company s sales 
filter sales continue year to year growth as sales increased in fiscal and in fiscal  primarily due to an increase in the number of units sold for these products 
the lower growth rate is a result of some erosion of pricing in the filter market and the long development and introduction cycle for our new filter products 
the company continues to invest resources in this area and expects to continue increasing its filter offering  as well as enhancing design capability for cdma and w cdma products 
in addition  the company is also capitalizing on its strengths in product packaging and believes these initiatives will result in an increase in our share of the filter market 
it is difficult to predict if  and when  this strategy to focus on filter products will have a significant impact on the company s sales 
frequency control module sales increased in fiscal  an increase from a decrease in fiscal these products accounted for of total sales in fiscal and in frequency control module sales in prior years predominately included sales to the company s then largest customer  digital equipment corporation digital  for use in systems based on the alpha microprocessor 
sales to digital decreased in fiscal compared to  primarily as a result of lower average selling prices  as this customer converted to lower priced units as well as reduced number of units sold 
sales to digital accounted for approximately and of total sales during fiscal and respectively 
the company s top five customers accounted for approximately   and of the company s total sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
over the last three fiscal years  a significant portion of the increased sales were due to new customers 
no single customer accounted for more than of total sales in international sales primarily in europe and asia were approximately of the company s total sales during the last three fiscal years 
the company considers all product sales with a delivery destination outside north america to be international sales 
these sales are denominated primarily in us currency 
sales to customers in asian markets ranged from to of total sales during the last three years 
the company intends to continue its focus on international sales in the future and expects that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of its business 
this focus on international sales may not be achieved 
even if achieved  the company s international sales are highly sensitive to fluctuations in such markets 
for example  recent instability in asian economies may result in fluctuations in asian sales and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
while the company has achieved sales increases in prior periods  there can be no assurance that this can be achieved in future periods 
the company s success is highly dependent on achieving technological advances in its product design and manufacturing capabilities  as well as its ability to sell its products in a competitive marketplace that can be influenced by outside factors such as economic and regulatory conditions 
the company experiences increased competition from companies that offer alternative solutions such as phased locked loop technology 
competition from alternative technologies or from competitors duplicating the company s technologies could adversely affect selling prices and market share 
gross profit margin gross profit margin decreased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal  and in fiscal  primarily as a result of decreased gross profit margin for the company s low power component and virtual wire r short range radio device products 
margins for these products decreased because the per unit selling prices decreased due to competitive pressures more rapidly than per unit manufacturing costs 
per unit manufacturing costs continued to decrease due to improved production processes that increased yields and productivity  and increased demand creating an increase in the number of units produced 
the increased number of units produced allowed relatively high fixed overhead costs to be lower on a per unit basis 
the increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to an increase in gross margin for the company s low power component and virtual wire r short range radio device products 
in  per unit manufacturing costs decreased more rapidly than selling prices for these products 
however  the trend toward lower per unit manufacturing costs  which occurred in recent years  may not be able to continue 
if average selling prices were to decrease faster than per unit manufacturing costs decrease  then the company s gross profit margins would be adversely impacted 
gross margins for the company s frequency control and filter products were relatively stable during these periods 
the company has in the past experienced sudden increases in demand which have put pressure on its manufacturing facilities to increase capacity to meet this demand 
in addition  new products sometimes require different manufacturing processes than the company currently possesses 
the company has devoted the bulk of its capital expenditures to increase capacity and improve its manufacturing processes 
the company may not be able to continue to increase its manufacturing capacity and improve its manufacturing processes in a timely manner so as to take advantage of increased market demand 
failure to do this would result in a loss of potential sales in the periods impacted 
research and development research and development expenses increased approximately in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in both fiscal and was due to the increased cost of process engineering  document control services  and enhancing design capability for its product development efforts 
since sales increased comparably to research and development expenses  such expenses maintained a level at of total sales for the last three fiscal years 
the company believes that the continued development of its technology and new products is essential to its success and is committed to continuing its investment in research and development  which is expected to increase in absolute dollars in future periods 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses decreased approximately in fiscal and increased in fiscal this decrease was due primarily to decrease in sales incentives and marketing costs 
since sales increased comparably to sales and marketing expenses  such expenses decreased to of total sales in fiscal from of total sales in fiscal the company expects to incur higher sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars in future periods as it expands its sales and marketing efforts 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased approximately in fiscal and increased in fiscal the decrease in was primarily attributable to decreased incentive and legal costs 
the increase in was due to support for the company s expansion and increased costs for write offs of certain receivable accounts 
there can be no assurance that the company will not continue to incur bad debt write offs as it expands its business to new customers and new geographic areas 
the company currently expects general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods 
since sales increased faster than general and administrative expenses  such expenses decreased to of sales in fiscal from in fiscal litigation expense litigation expense  which amounted to  in fiscal year  consists of expenses related to the resolution of the legal matter with timekeeping systems  inc expenses include legal expenses  settlement costs and related travel 
legal expenses related to the timekeeping systems  inc matter were substantially lower in the prior fiscal year 
the company does not expect to incur significant expenses with regard to this matter in future periods 
other income expense during the current year  the company maintained indebtedness at an lower average balance compared to prior years  resulting in a decrease in interest expense for fiscal  compared to fiscal additionally  improved results of invested cash and currency conversion resulted in increases in interest income and gains losses on currency exchange transactions 
all of these factors contributed to an increase in other income expense 
income tax expense the company s income tax expense was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  and  in fiscal fiscal included the one time favorable impact of  
per share  resulting from recognition of research and development tax credits 
the company s effective tax rate  exclusive of the fiscal one time tax credit  was approximately   and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the reduction in tax rate in compared to was primarily due to the company taking advantage of foreign sales corporation benefits 
earnings per share net income increased to million in the current year as compared to million in the prior year 
the company s earnings per share was 
per diluted share for fiscal  compared to 
per diluted share for fiscal and 
per diluted share for fiscal fourth quarter of fiscal unaudited quarterly financial data is presented in note of the accompanying financial statements 
sales for the fourth quarter increased to million  compared to million in the comparable quarter of the prior year 
the sales increase was primarily due to an increase virtual wire r short range radio device modules and frequency control modules sales of approximately and  respectively  compared to the comparable quarter of the prior year 
this was primarily due the increased demand for some of the company s newer value added products 
sales were impacted negatively due to the general motors strike during this period 
gross profit margins were in the fourth quarter  compared to for the comparable quarter of the prior year 
this was primarily due to significant additional cost in increasing production late in the quarter and in bringing newly developed products to production status in our filter and virtual wire r short range radio device modules product lines 
as a result  start up costs  lower than desired yields and some loss of productivity occurred 
the company plans to put the same cost reduction efforts on these products that have historically resulted in lower per unit manufacturing costs for low power components 
operating income for the fourth quarter was million  or of total sales which is comparable to the prior year 
this stability in operating income as a percentage of total sales was due to control of expenses which decreased million in the fourth quarter  compared to the comparable quarter of the prior year 
operating expenses  including incentive costs  were reduced in anticipation of the negative impact of the general motors strike 
earnings per diluted share was 
in the fourth quarter  compared to 
for the comparable quarter of the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources principal sources of liquidity at august   consisted of million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and million of unused credit facilities 
the unutilized portion of the credit facilities includes million under a line of credit agreement and million under an equipment collateralized operating lease facility 
the equipment collateralized operating lease facility is to be advanced in stages prior to december  subsequent to august   the company negotiated an additional equipment collateralized operating lease facility for million  to be advanced in stages prior to october  the credit facilities contain financial covenants and restrictions relating to various matters  including a minimum net worth requirement  a minimum ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest expense and current maturity of the term loan  a minimum quick ratio and a maximum ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth 
as of august   the company was in compliance with such covenants and restrictions 
net cash from operations decreased to million due to million of cash used in working capital  such as inventory  offset by a million increase in net income and non cash items included in net income  such as depreciation and amortization 
included in the accounts receivable balance is a past due receivable totaling  from a customer 
the company is seeking to recover the entire  of this past due account plus an additional  for custom finished goods manufactured and raw material purchased for this customer 
the company believes that reserves are not necessary with regard to this matter and  as a result  no additional allowance for uncollectible amounts has been established 
cash used in investing activities in the current year was million 
fiscal year and capital acquisitions included significant purchases of property and equipment to enhance the company s manufacturing facilities 
the company expects to acquire approximately million to million of capital equipment by the end of fiscal  consisting primarily of equipment needed for its manufacturing facilities 
some of this equipment may be acquired under an equipment collateralized operating lease facility 
net cash from financing activities was million in and 
million in funds raised from operations and exercises of stock options were mostly used to repay other debt and acquire property and equipment 
the company believes that cash generated from operations  if any  banking facilities  and the million balance in cash and short term investments will be sufficient to meet the company s operating cash requirements through fiscal to the extent that these sources of funds are insufficient to also meet the company s capital expenditure requirements  the company will be required to raise additional funds 
additional financing for capital expenditures may not be available 
if available  it may not be available on acceptable terms 
year readiness disclosure the year issue involves potential inability of information or other data dependent systems to properly distinguish year references as of the turn of the century 
the company believes the year issue represents a material risk to the company 
the company itself is heavily dependent upon the proper functioning of its own computer systems  including computers and related software for its financial and manufacturing information systems  computers  programmable logic controllers and other data dependent equipment in its manufacturing processes  and computers  scientific equipment and related software for its engineering  research and development activities 
any failure or malfunctioning on the part of these or other systems could cause disruptions of operations  including a temporary inability to process financial transactions  manufacture products or engage in ordinary business activities in ways that are not currently known  discernible  quantifiable or otherwise anticipated by the company 
the company has formed a team to evaluate and deal with the impact of the year issue 
it has developed a plan the plan for the company to become year compliant in a timely manner 
the plan covers both systems such as networked computers and software that are commonly called information technology it systems and those such as embedded technology in manufacturing equipment non it systems 
the company s plan consists of several phases 
the first is the inventory and prioritization of potential year items  and the assessment of year compliance 
the next phase is the remediation of any noted problems 
the third phase is the testing of material items 
the last phase is the preparation of contingency plans 
for the company s most significant it systems  the inventory and remediation phases have been completed 
most of the company s business information systems have been recently replaced by glovia tm and oracle r software  which are represented by providers to be year compliant 
the inventory of non it systems is nearing completion and is scheduled for completion prior to december  the remediation of remaining systems and testing for all systems is scheduled for completion by june  the company currently has no contingency plans to deal with the most likely worst case scenarios 
the company currently anticipates that it will complete contingency planning by june  the company s suppliers particularly sole source and long lead time suppliers and key customers may be adversely affected by their respective failures to address the year issue 
if the company s suppliers are unable to provide goods or services  the company s operations could be materially adversely effected 
key customers which encounter year difficulties could fail to order or take delivery of the company s products  or could fail to make or delay payments to the company 
such failure or delay could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
while some of these risks are outside the control of the company  the company s plan includes communications with suppliers and customers to ascertain the state of their year compliance program 
the questionnaire phase of this activity is scheduled for completion by december  remediation activities and preparation of contingency plans related to suppliers and customers is scheduled for completion by june  the total cost of the purchase and implementation of the business information systems recently implemented is expected to be approximately million  of which approximately has already been incurred 
the remediation costs for the other it and non it systems is expected to be less than  such costs will be funded either from operating cash flows or by utilizing existing company credit facilities 
time spent by implementation team members is not included in the above estimates but are included in the company s normal operating budget 
the year implementation program is not expected to cause material delays in non year related it projects 
the company has determined that its products are not effected by calendar dating 
therefore  there is no known or anticipated year impact on its product offering 
the company believes its year plan will significantly reduce the probability of significant interruptions of normal operations resulting from year issues 
however  the company may not properly identify and assess all year issues  or it may not remediate and test all its it and non it systems in a timely or adequate manner 
in addition  its key suppliers or customers could experience year problems 
if any of these potential situations occur  the company s contingency plans may not be adequate to protect the company from the adverse effects of such problems 
the worst case scenario resulting from year issues would be a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations  an interruption in normal business operations  or an adverse impact on the company s relationships with customers  suppliers or others
