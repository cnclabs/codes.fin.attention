the company generally does not directly compete with other racetracks or simulcast facilities for patrons due to geographic separation of such facilities 
however  the company competes with other sports  entertainment and gaming options  including riverboat casinos and lotteries  for patrons for both live racing and simulcasting 
the company attempts to attract patrons by providing the highest quality racing products in attractive entertainment facilities with well priced  appealing concession services 
the company is the premier racetrack in kentucky for both live racing and simulcasting  based upon total handle and attendance  and the only facility in indiana providing live and simulcast racing 
the development of riverboat gaming facilities began in indiana pursuant to authorizing legislation passed by the state of indiana in illinois had previously authorized riverboat gaming 
there are currently four riverboat casinos operating on the ohio river along kentucky s border two in the southeastern indiana cities of lawrenceburg and rising sun  one in southwestern indiana in evansville and one at metropolis  illinois 
direct competition with these riverboats has negatively impacted wagering at churchill downs and other racetracks in western and northern kentucky 
however  churchill downs reversed this trend in with the increase in attendance and wagering experienced during its spring and fall meets  due primarily to an aggressive on track marketing program  and further expansion of interstate simulcasting 
one  and possibly two  additional riverboats are anticipated to open along the indiana shore of the ohio river 
in may  the indiana gaming commission awarded a preliminary license to rdi caesars world to operate the world s largest riverboat casino in harrison county  indiana  just miles from louisville 
a construction permit was issued to rdi caesars world by the us army corps of engineers in february  and they have announced that the riverboat will open in the summer of however  the us environmental protection agency is now conducting a separate review of the corps decision  and its recommendation could result in further delays for the project 
the indiana gaming commission voted in december to postpone indefinitely the page of churchill downs incorporated item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations granting of a license to open a fifth indiana riverboat along the ohio river in either crawford county or switzerland county  within or miles  respectively  of louisville 
the full impact of riverboat casinos on kentucky racing cannot be accurately determined until all riverboats are open and the markets are fully matured 
studies project that churchill downs could experience a material adverse impact on its wagering and attendance in the louisville market when the caesars world riverboat is open and mature 
these same studies projected similar declines in western and northern kentucky but recent experience at ellis park and turfway park indicates the impact may not be as severe as these studies projected 
in addition to those riverboats operating along the ohio river  five riverboat casinos have opened along the indiana shore of lake michigan near the company s sports spectrum in merrillville  indiana 
the company s pari mutuel wagering activities at the merrillville facility have been adversely impacted by the opening of these lake michigan riverboats 
additionally  the potawatomi indian tribe has expressed an interest in establishing land based casino operations in northeastern indiana 
at this time  proposed changes to the indian gaming regulatory act could have an impact on compact negotiations between the potawatomi tribe and the state of indiana 
the company continues to anticipate that development of any such indian casino operations will negatively impact pari mutuel wagering activities at its indiana facilities 
however  the extent of the impact is unknown at this time due  in part  to the uncertain geographic distances between the company s operations and the number of potential casino sites 
the company continues to pursue legislation to allow video lottery terminals at its racetrack facilities in kentucky and indiana 
the integration of alternative gaming products is one of four core business strategies developed by the company to position itself to compete in this changing environment 
implementing these strategies  the company has successfully grown its live racing product by strengthening its flagship operations  increasing its share of the interstate simulcast market  and geographically expanding its racing operations into indiana 
alternative gaming in the form of video lottery terminals and slot machines should enable churchill downs to more effectively compete with indiana riverboat casinos  and provide new revenue for purse money and capital investment 
currently  churchill downs is working with members of the kentucky horse industry to establish a consensus for a plan to operate video lottery terminals exclusively at kentucky s racetracks

per admission to riverboats in the state to compensate for the effect of riverboat competition 
riverboat admissions revenue from the company s indiana operations increased million as a result of the opening of additional riverboats along the ohio river and lake michigan since december  the net increase in riverboat admissions revenue  after required purse and marketing expense increases of approximately million  is million 
legislation challenging the allocation of the 
subsidy was introduced to the senate finance committee in the recent session of the indiana general assembly  but the bill did not pass out of the committee 
a change in hoosier park s share of the tax would significantly impact funding for operating expenditures and would in all likelihood reemphasize the need for the integration of alternative gaming products at the racetrack in order for it to effectively compete with riverboat casinos
