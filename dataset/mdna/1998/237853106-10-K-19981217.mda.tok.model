item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company s revenues are derived from three sources i computer hardware sales  ii software licenses  and iii sales of services  including training  conversion  networking  database access  system support  and product maintenance 
revenue is recognized on hardware sales and software licenses upon shipment of the product 
revenue from hardware and software maintenance contracts is recognized monthly over the term of the maintenance contracts 
other service revenues are recognized upon completion of the services 
the components of the cost for development of software primarily include salaries and employee benefits and are expensed as incurred 
all costs qualifying for deferral are reported on the balance sheet as deferred software costs and amortized over the estimated useful life of the product in accordance with sfas no 
the amortization of capitalized software is allocated as a direct cost of licensing dra software 
the company typically experiences greater gross margin on software licenses and services than on sales of hardware 
the company s profitability depends in part on the mix of its revenue components and not necessarily on total revenues 
this document contains a substantial number of forward looking statements  indicated by such words as expects  believes  estimates  anticipates  plans  assessment  should  will  and similar words 
these forward looking statements are based on the company s and management s beliefs  assumptions  expectations  estimates and projections any or all of which are subject to future change  depending on unknown developments and facts 
these forward looking statements should be read in conjunction with the company s disclosures under the heading cautionary statements additional important factors to be considered  below and in exhibit results of operations fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  hardware revenues decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease is due in part to three large hardware upgrades that produced million in hardware revenue in fiscal  in part to anticipation of taos delivery  and to a significant degree to customers increasing ability to buy high performance systems at a lower price 
management expects that hardware revenues will continue to decline 
the gross margin on hardware was in fiscal and in software license revenues increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase is primarily a result of a large dra classic turnkey contract that generated 
million in software license revenue in fiscal  and  in part  due to the first revenue recognized from taos 
the gross margin percentage on software was for fiscal and for fiscal the increase is due primarily to an increase in fiscal of revenues from dra classic software which has a higher margin than other types of software sold by the company 
service and other revenues increased 
million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase is primarily due to the larger installed base of licensed software products that annually generate maintenance revenues 
maintenance revenues increased million in fiscal management expects that maintenance revenues will continue to increase as the base of licensed software products increases 
the increase in maintenance revenues was offset by decreases in revenues from some of the company s contract implementation services 
these revenues decreased because the company implemented fewer new contracts in fiscal than in fiscal the gross margin percentage on service and other revenues remained consistent at in fiscal and in fiscal cost of revenues decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease is primarily a result of the decrease in hardware revenues in fiscal from fiscal salaries and employee benefits increased 
million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to annual raises and to the implementation of a formal pay scale 
the increase was mitigated somewhat by the continued capitalization in fiscal of salaries and benefits related to software development 
general and administrative expenses increased 
million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to the write off in fiscal of 
million of development tools that the company has discontinued using 
depreciation and amortization increased 
million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal primarily as a result of renovations made in to one of the company s headquarters buildings 
income from operations decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease is a result of a decrease in hardware sales and an increase in salaries and benefits and general and administrative expenses as discussed above 
other income expense increased 
million to million in fiscal from 
million in fiscal due to increased rates earned on cash investments 
the company s consolidated effective tax rate was in both fiscal and fiscal the consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal is less than the us statutory rate primarily due to the generation and utilization of significant research and development credits in the current year 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  hardware revenues decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease is primarily due to two large full service contracts that generated million in hardware revenues in fiscal and  in part  due to anticipation of taos delivery 
the gross margin percentage on hardware was for fiscal and for fiscal the increase is due primarily to a larger percentage of hardware sales being derived from pcs in fiscal pcs have historically had a lower gross margin than other components of integrated hardware systems 
management expects that customers increasing ability to buy high performance systems at lower prices may negatively impact the growth of hardware revenues in the future 
software license revenues decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease is primarily a result of two large full service contracts that generated million in software license revenues in fiscal and  in part  due to anticipation of taos delivery 
the gross margin percentage on software was for fiscal and for fiscal the decrease is due primarily to a decrease in software license revenues in fiscal from fiscal  coupled with increased amortization expense charged to costs of revenues in fiscal see note a to the consolidated financial statements software development 
service and other revenues increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase is primarily due to the larger installed base of licensed software products that annually generate maintenance revenues 
maintenance revenues increased million in fiscal management expects that maintenance revenues will continue to increase as the base of licensed software products increases 
the gross margin percentage on service and other revenues remained consistent at in fiscal and in fiscal cost of revenues decreased 
million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease is primarily a result of the decrease in hardware revenues in fiscal over fiscal salaries and employee benefits decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease is primarily attributable to higher capitalization in fiscal of salaries and employee benefits related to software development 
general and administrative expenses decreased 
million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease is primarily attributable to higher capitalization in fiscal of general and administrative expenses related to software development 
income from operations decreased 
million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease is a result of decreases in hardware sales and software licenses offset by a decrease in salaries and benefits and general administrative expenses as discussed above 
other income expense increased  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due to increased investment income from higher investment levels 
the company s consolidated effective tax rate was in fiscal and in fiscal this decrease is primarily attributable to the utilization of foreign subsidiaries loss carry forwards in fiscal for which no previous benefit had been recognized 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash needs are primarily for working capital and capital expenditures and historically have been met by cash flows from operations  bank borrowings  and equipment leases 
at september   the company s working capital was million  and its ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to  as compared to working capital of million and a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of to at september  the decrease in working capital is primarily attributable to the use of cash for the company s stock repurchase program 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the decrease in net cash provided by operations was primarily due to a million increase in the accounts receivable balance during fiscal  compared to a million decrease in the accounts receivable balance during fiscal the increase in accounts receivable relates to the timing of payments received from customers

year readiness disclosure the arrival of the year poses certain technological challenges resulting from a reliance of some computer technologies on two digits rather than four digits to represent the calendar year eg  for 
it is generally believed that computer technologies programmed in this manner  if not corrected  may produce inaccurate or unpredictable results or system failures in connection with the transition from to  when dates will begin to have a lower two digit number than dates in the prior century 
this problem  the so called year problem or yk problem  could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations  business or business prospects because  in order to function properly  the company s products must interface with a multitude of software and hardware products manufactured by unrelated third parties 
the company has been working diligently to prevent or mitigate disruptions relating to the year as of september   the company has reviewed all of its proprietary software products and believes that all of such software products are currently capable of accurately processing date data related to the change from to  if used with third party products that are also capable of accurately processing such data 
the company has formed an oversight committee and has developed a plan to coordinate identification  evaluation and implementation of any necessary changes to the computer systems  applications and business processes used by the company in the operation of its business 
as of september   the oversight committee had identified the company s systems that could potentially be impacted by the yk problem 
the company is currently in the process of prioritizing the identified systems and undertaking three primary steps to validate systems readiness 
the three steps are obtaining a vendor readiness statement internal testing  and third party validation through an authorized organization that has already tested the systems 
the company plans to obtain a vendor readiness statement for all identified systems and to perform internal testing on those identified as critical to its operations that have not already been validated through a third party authorized organization 
the company expects to have finished identifying and prioritizing systems by march  by june   the company will have completed necessary testing of critical systems and will have compiled a list of identified problems and recommended solutions 
beginning in july  the company will begin applying solutions  verifying that such solutions make the system s avoid the yk problem  and developing a contingency plan for any critical system that remains susceptible to theyk problem 
the company plans to be complete with all yk readiness and contingency planning well before december the company anticipates that its yk action plan discussed above will be carried out solely by existing employees 
accordingly  the company has not incurred any material incremental costs and has not identified any incremental future costs associated with the yk problem 
no assurances can be given that the company will be able to completely identify or address all issues related to the year problem that affect the company  or that third parties with whom the company does business will not experience system failures as a result of the year problem  nor can the company fully predict the consequences of any such failure 
there is no single customer or product vendor which  in the company s assessment  is or may be likely to present any significant exposure due to the year problem 
however  management anticipates that there may be some negative impact on the timely receipt of accounts receivable due to the failure of certain customers to prepare adequately for the year problem 
in a worst case scenario  these accounts receivable related difficulties might require the company to draw down its own credit line or to reduce the amount of available cash on hand 
the company also could face some risk from the possible failure of one or more of its third party vendors to continue to provide uninterrupted service through the changeover to the year because the company outsources the delivery of hardware to its customers  such a failure could affect the installation of the company s products at customer locations 
while an evaluation of the year preparedness of its third party vendors has been part of the company s yk action plan  the company s ability to evaluate is limited to some extent by the willingness of vendors to supply information and the ability of vendors to verify the yk preparedness of their own systems or their sub providers 
however  the company has received assurances from its significant vendors that there will not be any such disruption  accordingly the company does not currently anticipate that any of its significant vendors will fail to provide continuing service due to the year problem 
the company  like similarly situated enterprises  is subject to certain risks as a result of possible industry wide or area wide failures triggered by the year problem 
for example  the failure of certain utility providers eg  electricity  gas  telecommunications to avoid disruption of service in connection with the transition from to could adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
in management s estimate  such a system wide or area wide failure presents a significant risk to the company in connection with the year problem because the resulting disruption may be entirely beyond the ability of the company to cure  and the company relies on such utilities for the delivery of its own products  particularly telecommunications 
the significance of any such disruption would depend on its duration and systemic and geographic magnitude 
of course  any such disruption would likely impact businesses other than the company 
the foregoing discussion of the company s year readiness contains a substantial number of forward looking statements  indicated by such words as expects  believes  estimates  anticipates  plans  assessment  should  will  and similar words 
these forward looking statements are based on the company s and management s beliefs  assumptions  expectations  estimates and projections any or all of which are subject to future change  depending on unknown developments and facts 
these forward looking statements should be read in conjunction with the company s disclosures under the heading cautionary statements additional important factors to be considered  below and in exhibit item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding market risk the company s exposure to potential near term losses in future earnings  fair value or cash flows resulting from reasonably possible changes in market rates or prices is not material 
cautionary statements additional important factors to be considered the company s future results could differ materially from those discussed in this document 
factors that could contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  the following rapid technological change 
the software industry is characterized by rapid change and uncertainty due to new and emerging technologies 
the pace of change has recently accelerated due to the internet  on line services  networking  and new programming languages 
there can be no assurance that dra will be successful in developing or acquiring product enhancements and new products necessary to keep pace with the changing technologies 
customer acceptance 
while the company performs extensive usability and beta testing of its new products  user acceptance and market penetration rates ultimately dictate the success of development and marketing efforts 
the company is currently in the later stages of development of a new system called taos 
contracts with governmental entities 
a substantial portion of the company s business is conducted with governmental entities 
both the award and execution of its governmental contracts are subject to numerous conditions  including the availability and appropriation of sufficient funding 
product ship schedules 
because a substantial portion of the company s revenues for each quarter is attributable to a limited number of orders and tends to be realized towards the end of each quarter  even short delays in new product releases or delays in the customers procurement processes can cause results to fluctuate substantially 
delays in the release of taos could have a significantly negative impact on the company s sales and results of operations 
because of the complexities inherent in developing software products as sophisticated as those sold by the company and the lengthy testing periods associated with such products  no assurance can be given that future product introductions by the company will not be delayed 
in the future  the company s revenues will be increasingly dependent on sales of taos  which is currently being developed 
the timing of the completion of this system  which is based on object oriented client server design  may be affected by multiple factors  including rapid technological change  dependence on third party suppliers  and the relative scarcity of qualified technical staff 
competition 
the library automation industry is highly competitive 
a number of companies offer products that target the library automation market 
dra competes with software vendors whose products operate on digital hardware platforms and software vendors whose products operate on different platforms 
certain of the company s competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  and sales resources than dra 
dependence on and relationship with compaq 
although dra is moving away from a strong dependence on compaq s digital computers  a substantial portion of the company s revenues are still derived from compaq s digital hardware and licensing of the company s software  which was originally designed to operate on digital computers 
dependence on key personnel 
dra s continued success depends in large part on certain key personnel  including michael j 
mellinger  its founder  president  and chief executive officer 
the loss of the services of mr 
mellinger and the inability of the company to attract and retain a suitable replacement could have a material adverse effect on the company 
principal shareholders 
michael j 
mellinger and f 
gilbert bickel iii combined own in excess of percent of the common stock outstanding 
as a result  mr 
mellinger and mr 
bickel may be able to effectively control the outcome of certain matters requiring a shareholder vote 
possible acquisitions 
the company may make acquisitions in the future 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations and products of the acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which the company has no or little direct experience  and potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies
