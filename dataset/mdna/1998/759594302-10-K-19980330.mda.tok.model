item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion will assist in the understanding of the company s financial position and results of operations 
the information below should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes to financial statements 
this discussion contains historical information and certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties about the business  long term strategy  financial condition and future of the company 
statements concerning results of future exploration  exploitation  development and acquisition expenditures and expense and reserve levels are forward looking statements 
these statements are based on assumptions concerning commodity prices  drilling results and production and administrative and interest costs that management believes are reasonable based on currently available information of known facts and trends 
however  management s assumptions and the company s future performance are both subject to a wide range of business risks and there is no assurance that these goals and projections can or will be met 
factors that may affect future results are included in the discussion below and in part i  item business and item properties 
remington oil and gas corporation the company is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company with activity and properties located in offshore gulf of mexico  mississippi alabama and onshore gulf coast 
the company acquired all of the assets and liabilities of okc limited partnership the partnership on april   in exchange for the common stock of the company the corporate conversion 
the partnership then distributed  as part of its liquidation and dissolution   shares of class a common voting stock the class a stock and  shares of class b non voting common stock the class b stock to the former general partners  limited partners and unitholders of the predecessor partnership 
after the corporate conversion  cloyce k 
box  one of the former general partners  owned approximately of the outstanding class a stock 
at the time of the corporate conversion  mr 
jr simplot  mr 
james arthur lyle and others had pending litigation against the partnership concerning voting issues and the purchase of an oil pipeline by a privately controlled affiliate of cloyce k 
box the griffin case 
see notes to the financial statements note contingencies griffin case 
after cloyce box s death in october  the class a stock was foreclosed upon by box brothers holding company bbhc 
at the time of the foreclosure  bbhc was primarily owned and controlled by the four sons of cloyce k 
box 
a number of disputes and lawsuits concerning the control of bbhc arose among the four brothers 
in march  the company appointed james a 
watt as president and chief operating officer 
subsequently  in february  the board of directors named mr 
watt chief executive officer 
mr 
watt  who has significant oil and gas experience  is the first executive from outside the controlling interest of the company to head the company 
in august  an entity controlled by mr 
simplot purchased the controlling interest in bbhc the simplot transaction 
shortly thereafter  bbhc changed its name to s sixteen holding company sshc 
in connection with this purchase  mr 
simplot and the four box brothers agreed to settle all lawsuits among them and the company 
the primary objective set by the new management for was to stop the decline in oil and natural gas reserves and bring average finding costs down to industry averages 
the company accomplished the first objective by increasing oil and natural gas reserves by approximately at december  compared to december  management also made great progress in the second objective by decreasing average finding costs from per boe in to per boe in the long term strategy now focuses on increasing reserves by sustaining an acceptable annual growth rate for reserves with finding and development costs that are in line with industry peers 
capital expenditures  financed primarily by operating cash flow  will entail a balanced exploration  development and acquisition program 
liquidity and capital resources the company s balance sheet liquidity decreased significantly during at december   current assets exceeded current liabilities by million  and the current ratio was approximately to at december   current assets exceeded current liabilities by million and the current ratio was approximately to the decline in liquidity resulted primarily from the sale of marketable securities in october  and the use of the proceeds to repurchase million of the convertible subordinated notes the notes 
the simplot transaction caused a change in control as defined in the indenture for the notes the indenture that required the company to make an offer to purchase the notes at of the face amount 
in addition  during  the company used some of the liquid assets and borrowed million to purchase million of treasury stock and fund the excess of capital expenditures over net cash flow from operations 
cash flow from operations for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the prior year 
in addition to lower natural gas revenues of million  cash payments totaling million for reorganization costs had a detrimental effect on the cash flow from operations during the year 
the lower natural gas revenues resulted primarily from a decrease in natural gas production from south pass block natural gas production from this offshore gulf of mexico block is sold under a gas sales contract that includes prices substantially above spot market prices 
therefore  a reduction in production from this block has a significant effect on natural gas revenues  total revenues  net income and cash flow from operations 
the concern over the concentration of revenues has prompted management to diversify the revenue stream through acquisitions and exploration drilling in other areas 
natural gas revenues from south pass block accounted for   and of total revenues for   and  respectively 
reorganization costs paid during included employee severance expense  litigation settlement amounts and other costs related to the simplot transaction 
see notes to financial statements note reorganization costs 
the company will continue to make significant capital expenditures over the next several years as part of the long term growth strategy and the primary source of funding the capital expenditures will be net cash flow from operations 
as stated above  natural gas sales from south pass block provided approximately of the company s total revenue in further  a significant portion of the natural gas revenues from south pass block is dependent on well b s 
early in and throughout the year  the company identified and followed a trend of increasing oil production and decreasing natural gas production in the well b s  the only well currently producing from the u sand reservoir 
the trend may indicate  among other things  that natural gas production will continue to decline as the oil column moves into the perforations of this well 
the company s net working interest deliverability seller s delivery capacity from platform b has declined from mmcfgd in january to mmcfgd in december current estimates have well b s producing at decreasing rates until march a large quantity of proved undeveloped natural gas reserves still remains in the u reservoir above the existing perforations in well b s 
management is currently evaluating several possible courses of action concerning the maximization of profit from south pass block and specifically the u reservoir 
such plans include  but are not limited to  a new well or sidetrack of an existing wellbore in the u reservoir 
recent discoveries  development wells and acquisitions lessen the company s dependence on natural gas revenue from this block  but may not be adequate to replace the immediate decline in gas revenue from unforeseen mechanical or other problems with well b s 
the recent decline in oil prices has a negative impact on total revenues and therefore net income and cash flow from operations 
the company s average oil price for was per barrel but has averaged under per barrel for the first two months of while the company s gas sales contract insulates the company to some degree from the lower oil prices  continued low prices for oil production will reduce the projected cash flow from operations and may cause the company to defer or eliminate certain capital expenditures 
the following table sets forth the company s actual capital expenditures  including exploration expenses  for the last three years and the current capital and exploration budget 
budget actual actual actual in thousands acquisition   land and leasehold     development     exploration     total     net proved oil and natural gas reserve additions in barrels of oil equivalents   finding costs per barrel of oil equivalent capital and exploration expenditures for oil and natural gas properties during totaled million compared to million in the primary capital expenditures for included drilling  completion and platform construction costs for eugene island block  drilling costs for a well on west cameron  drilling and completion costs on the parker creek field and a purchase of several south texas properties 
expected development costs for include one or two new wells in south pass block  a new well or a side track well in south pass block  additional development of west cameron block and eugene island block and four to six onshore wells including three to four wells in the parker creek field 
the company budgeted million for acquisition  land and leasehold costs 
the company will use these budgeted amounts to purchase oil and natural gas reserves at attractive prices and to maintain and develop an inventory of exploration development projects 
in march  the company completed an acquisition for million and submitted the high bid on one offshore block in the mms lease sales 
the company does not yet know whether the bid will be accepted 
budgeted exploration costs include three planned wells in the gulf of mexico  at least two wells in mississippi  and several wells in the onshore gulf coast region 
in addition  the company plans for approximately million of exploration expenses  which is primarily to purchase d and d seismic data 
the capital and exploration budget for is flexible and the company can delay many of the planned expenditures if better opportunities arise or if capital is not available from operations 
additional sources of capital include the repayment of the note receivable from sshc and additional cash available on the company s line of credit 
the note receivable from sshc is due may  the balance at december  was million  and payments from sshc have been greater than the required  per month 
during the second quarter of  the company established a million line of credit with a bank 
the line of credit  with a current borrowing base of million  expires in june the company anticipates renewing this line again in or obtaining a similar line of credit when the line of credit comes due 
the line of credit is collateralized by the company s south pass oil and natural gas properties 
the company has borrowed million and has issued letters of credit totaling  against this line 
the company and phillips petroleum company phillips are engaged in a dispute concerning the net profits interest in south pass block a non jury trial was held in april phillips alleges damages in excess of million on one claim and several million dollars on two additional claims 
phillips further contended that it was entitled to double damages and cancellation of the farmout agreement that created the net profits interest 
oral arguments were presented to the court september  certain outcomes of this litigation could have a material adverse impact on the liquidity of the company 
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 entitled earnings per share in sfas simplifies the standards for computing earnings per share previously found in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
basic income per share and diluted income per share have replaced primary income per share and fully diluted income per share  respectively 
basic income per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period 
diluted income per share reflects the potential dilution from the exercise or conversion of securities or other contracts to issue common stock and other events that result in the issuance of common stock that shares in the net income of the company 
diluted income per share is computed similarly to fully diluted income per share pursuant to apb opinion the company s presentation of basic income per share and diluted income per share are the same as the previously presented primary income per share and fully diluted income per share 
basic income per share and diluted income per share are the same because the effects of the potential dilutive securities are anti dilutive 
see notes to financial statements note significant accounting policies 
the company has assessed and continues to assess the impact of the year issue on its reporting systems and operations 
the year issue exists because many computer systems and applications currently use two digit date fields to designate a year 
as the century date occurs  date sensitive systems will recognize the year as or not at all 
this inability to recognize or properly treat the year may cause systems to process critical financial and operational information incorrectly 
the company s system is a pc based network and all application software is purchased from outside third parties that have a significant presence in the oil and natural gas industry or in general application software 
the company projects all computer systems and software will be year compliant during management does not estimate future expenditures related to the year exposure to be significant 
results of operations the following table discloses the net oil and natural gas sales volumes  average sales prices and average lifting costs for each of the three years ended december    and the table is an integral part of the following discussion of results of operations for the periods compared to and compared to increase increase decrease decrease net sales volumes oil mbbls  natural gas mmcf    average sales price oil per bbl natural gas per mcf average lifting costs per boe compared to the company incurred a net loss for of million or per share compared to the prior year loss of million or per share 
the net loss for included non cash charges totaling million or per share 
the charges included deferred income tax expense of million or per share  impairment charges from marginal oil and gas properties of million or per share  and accelerated amortization of debt issue costs of  or per share  caused by the early retirement of some of the company s notes 
in addition  during  the company incurred reorganization costs totaling million  or per share  and legal costs and expenses totaling million  or per share 
total revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  natural gas sales revenue decreased million  or  for compared to lower natural gas production caused the decrease but was partially offset by higher average prices of for spot gas sales and for natural gas sales under the south pass gas sales contract 
the increase in average prices added million to natural gas sales revenue 
natural gas production from south pass block platform b decreased bcf during as production from well b experienced anticipated declines 
the decrease in natural gas production from platform b caused natural gas revenues to decrease by million 
natural gas production from the company s south texas properties increased  mcf during but was more than offset by lower net natural gas production from other offshore properties 
an increase in oil production partially offset by lower oil prices resulted in a net increase in oil sales revenue of million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
oil production increased by  barrels which increased oil sales revenue by million 
however  a decrease of in average oil prices caused oil sales revenue to be million lower 
a net increase in oil production came from all areas of operation primarily the parker creek field in mississippi and south pass and in the gulf of mexico 
interest income was lower in because of the sale of the marketable securities in october 
most of the proceeds of the sale were used to purchase million of the company s outstanding notes 
other income was lower because of lower oil trading income and losses on the sale of assets  primarily artwork 
operating and transportation expenses increased as a result of new operating properties and an increase in oil production from the south pass area 
net profits expense decreased as a result of the lower natural gas sales revenues from south pass block in addition  exploration expenses decreased significantly as a result of lower dry hole costs 
in the company drilled three high cost dry exploration wells totaling million in the gulf of mexico 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses increased because of new properties becoming productive 
marginal production as well as lower oil prices caused the company to record impairment charges against some of the oil and natural gas properties 
a large decrease in production during the last quarter of from main pass block  located in the gulf of mexico  caused the company to record a million impairment charge to write down of the remaining well costs 
the company will use the platform on main pass block to drill a new unrelated prospect in another million charge was recorded on the hub property located in mississippi 
this property was drilled in but never performed up to expectations 
the remaining impairment charge related primarily to lower oil prices which reduced the amount of commercially recoverable oil reserves 
general and administrative expenses decreased by during when compared to salaries and other employment related expenses during decreased  as the number of employees decreased from at december  to at december  other areas of significant savings were professional fees and investor relations expenses 
legal fees decreased by million as the company settled the griffin litigation including all of the surrounding litigation  ended the family litigation  and concluded the trial proceedings in the phillips litigation 
reorganization expense for the year includes payments to employees under the employee severance agreements and legal fees or other charges that relate to or were paid because of the simplot transaction 
reorganization costs accrued or paid are as follows employee severance payments million  thomas d 
box severance  legal claims and fees million  mr 
simplot and mr 
lyle million  and other associated expenses  see notes to the financial statements note reorganization costs 
interest and financing expenses increased during when compared to as a result of interest costs from a million balance on the line of credit and a non cash charge for deferred offering costs in october  partially offset by lower interest costs from a reduced outstanding balance on the notes 
the company used the line of credit to provide a portion of the funds to purchase some onshore gulf coast properties 
in addition  under the terms of the indenture  the company purchased million of the notes 
the simplot transaction triggered the offer to purchase requirement in the indenture 
although the company expects to realize the benefits of the deferred income tax asset  it adopted a more conservative view of the accounting and reporting policies and increased the valuation allowance in to reserve the full amount of the deferred income tax asset 
the company believes that this approach is consistent with other small cap exploration and production companies particularly those companies that are attempting to grow their oil and natural gas reserves 
the company is required to analyze its ability to realize the deferred income tax asset based on proved reserves and a more likely than not scenario for future projections 
the analysis excludes probable and possible oil and natural gas reserves and does not include results from future drilling activities 
the company concluded that based on the future growth plans of the company  prior actual results  and the more likely than not criteria  it was more desirable to reserve the entire deferred income tax asset 
the company will realize a benefit from these tax attributes if income is generated in the future 
compared to the company incurred a net loss for totaling million  or per share 
this loss resulted primarily from a million  or  increase in exploration expenses  a million  or  increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense on the oil and natural gas properties  and a million  or  increase in general and administrative and reorganization expenses 
exploration expenses increased because of higher dry hole costs which resulted from the increased drilling activity 
the most significant dry holes drilled during the year included the following offshore gulf of mexico blocks ship shoal block at million  high island block at million and west cameron block at  depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased as a result of new properties being depleted  an increase in the depreciable basis of offshore platforms and a decrease in net oil and natural gas reserves 
general and administrative expenses and reorganization costs were higher because of an increase in legal fees primarily related to the reimbursement of legal fees to the estate of cloyce k 
box for the simplot litigation and the change in control which occurred when bbhc replaced the existing board of directors by a written consent effective july  the change in control triggered the applicability of severance agreements which then resulted in the payment of severance benefits in certain situations 
resignations and terminations decreased the total number of employees from prior to july   to at december  natural gas revenue increased million primarily as a result of higher average natural gas prices 
although the average sales price shown on the table above reflects a decrease  such decrease in prices is a result of the lower percentage of total volume from south pass block sold at above market prices compared to a higher percentage of total volume from other areas which were sold at spot market prices during as compared to the prior years 
the per annum increase in the gas price for south pass block production  in accordance with the gas sales contract  resulted in an additional million in natural gas sales revenue 
average spot market prices for natural gas increased from in to for  which added another million to natural gas sales revenue 
in addition  production from platform d located in south pass block  main pass block  and other properties increased by bcf  or  when compared to  resulting in an additional million in natural gas sales revenue 
however  the above increases were partially offset by a  mcf decrease in natural gas production from south pass block which  when combined with the high contract price received for production from this block  lowered natural gas sales revenue by million 
natural gas production from south pass block decreased because the b well experienced mechanical difficulties in march  and attempts to drill a replacement well in were not successful 
net natural gas production from south pass block decreased  mcf  resulting in a decrease in natural gas sales revenue totaling  oil sales increased million  or  because of an increase of in the average oil price from to and an increase in total oil production of  bbls 
the increase in price caused oil sales revenue to increase million  and the increase in production caused oil sales revenue to increase million 
oil production increased as a result of a full year of production from platform d producing from south pass block and west delta block  and new production from the indian wells field in mississippi and other onshore oil properties 
platform d production increased  bbls and new production from the indian wells field totaled  bbls in oil production from south pass blocks and decreased primarily as a result of natural depletion of the reservoirs 
in  the company sold real estate properties in mississippi and louisiana for a total gain of million as part of a reorganization plan adopted in early in  the gain from the sales of real estate in mississippi and louisiana was  the decrease was partially offset by a  increase in net oil trading income 
operating expenses were  or  higher in because of the increase in the number of operating properties  a full year of operating cost from platform d in south pass block  and a partial year of operating costs from main pass block net profits expense decreased approximately  or million primarily  because of a net decrease in natural gas revenues from south pass block as described above
