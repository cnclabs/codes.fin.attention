item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis to be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements 
comparisons are with amounts unless otherwise stated the company produces and sells natural gas and oil acquired through exploration and development or through the purchase of producing properties 
producing properties are held in the united states in the gulf of mexico and utah  in the british sector of the north sea and in libya 
exploration continues in these areas 
in august  the company acquired of the interests held by santa fe minerals  inc and affiliates in offshore gulf of mexico blocks  significantly increasing reserves  production and exploration acreage in this area 
the company continues to dedicate the majority of its attention and resources to the us gulf of mexico area and currently holds interests in offshore lease blocks upon which exploration or production operations are conducted 
exploration offices in dallas and new orleans employ highly skilled technical staff and leading edge technology in the identification and delineation of gas and oil prospects 
the company s reporting currency is the us dollar 
analysis of operating results the increase in production revenue resulted from an increase in average price received for natural gas to per mcf  a decrease in average oil price received to per barrel  an increase in natural gas production volumes to bcf and a increase in oil production volume to  barrels 
a per mcf change in the average natural gas price received in would have resulted in a change in revenue  cash flow and pre tax income of million 
a per barrel change in the average oil price would have resulted in a change in revenue of million and a change in cash flow and pre tax income of a slightly lesser amount 
us production volumes of both oil and gas  particularly in late  were measurably constricted by delays in new pipeline construction 
such constrictions continued through january and will affect first quarter accordingly 
in libya  production commenced in december from three wells in the sirte basin 
six to twelve months of production testing is needed to determine reserve quantities and the economics of additional drilling 
production and pricing during  chieftain s production mix  on an energy equivalent basis  was natural gas and oil and ngls 
on a geographic basis  of energy equivalent production came from the united states 
this ratio is expected to remain fairly constant in chieftain has interests in wells in the gulf of mexico of which produce gas and ngls and produce oil 
the largest increases in production during came from the main pass  matagorda island and east cameron areas 
in the north sea  three wells  one of which has two laterals  produce natural gas and ngls 
oil production in came primarily from interests in wells in the aneth and ratherford units located in southeast utah 
in  growth in oil production is expected to occur at the east cameron field in the gulf and from production testing in the sirte basin in libya 
oil is expected to comprise approximately of production on an energy equivalent basis in at year end  chieftain was producing  before royalties  mmcfd in the us  mmcfd in the north sea  bd from the aneth and ratherford units in utah and bd from the gulf 
gas production is expected to increase by over mmcfd by the end of the first quarter of as various production constraints are alleviated 
a production test of three wells in the sirte basin began at year end and by early january  the company s share of production  until recovery of certain costs  was approximately bd with further increases expected before production stabilizes 
average annual gas prices were higher in than in the prior year 
exceptionally strong pricing for gas from the gulf of mexico prevailed during the winter months at the start of the year  and again in the august to november period 
the run up in prices during late summer was unexpected  but deliverability data shows that there is very little excess gas supply in chieftain s primary markets 
gas prices in north america weakened at year end due to warm weather and higher than normal deliveries from storage which reduced the spot demand for natural gas 
gas production contributed of company revenue 
while the bulk of chieftain s production is sold on a spot basis  some gas is occasionally sold forward for near months 
the company has a positive view of future prices  is reluctant to limit exposure to favorable price moves  and therefore does not generally sell forward large quantities for extended periods of time 
in all cases  buyers take delivery 
chieftain does not engage in speculative forward selling of volumes that cannot be physically delivered 
higher rates of production are anticipated during as newly developed fields are brought on stream 
direct expenses and production taxes increased and  respectively  generally in line with levels of production 
during  cost increases in the gulf reflected the high level of activity experienced by contractors 
direct expenses  combined with production taxes  were maintained at the level of per mcfe 
new volumes are  in many cases  being produced through existing infrastructure  thereby contributing to overall efficiency and enhancing cash flow and earnings 
chieftain s strategy is to concentrate its exploration efforts in areas with nearby infrastructure  keeping facility costs low and allowing early production 
general and administrative expense  up  was also reflective of increased production volumes 
depletion and amortization expense increased  the result of a increase in units of production and a increase in average depletion rate to per gas equivalent unit 
capital resources and liquidity the table on this page summarizes cash provided from operating  financing and investing activities for each of the past two years 
cash generated from operating activities increased primarily as a result of higher operating revenue 
financing activities in provided million of cash  the net result of the exercise of employee stock options for million and the purchase of  common shares for cancellation for million 
in october  the company announced a normal course issuer bid for up to  common shares 
in  the company sold million common shares for million net of issue costs and realized a further million from the exercise of employee stock options 
source and use of cash us in thousands year ended december  cash provided from used in operating activities   financing activities  investing activities   increase decrease in cash   cash used in investing activities increased to million in the company participated in wells of which seven were still drilling at year end 
all of the wells were in the us in  the company participated in wells  in the us and one in the us industry activity levels were at a peak in  particularly in the gulf of mexico 
similarly high levels of demand for drilling and services have resulted in cost increases and delays in exploration and development programs 
recent declines in gas and oil prices are expected to reduce such demand 
the december  cash balance of million was down million from a year earlier 
the company has arranged a  revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks 
such facility was not drawn upon at december  and the company remains debt free 
outlook while post price declines for natural gas and oil from year earlier levels indicate the possibility of lower average prices for  higher production volumes are anticipated which should result in steadily increasing cash flow from operations 
the board of directors authorized an million capital expenditure program for which is expected to be funded by cash flow from operations and working capital 
such capital expenditures can be varied significantly with respect to timing and priority dependent upon exploration success  availability of equipment and services and current opportunities 
all of the company s computer systems are year compliant
