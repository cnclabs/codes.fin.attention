freedom operates twelve branches throughout south carolina 
balance sheet review general as of december   total assets and total gross loans had increased and  respectively  as compared to while total deposits had increased approximately during the same period 
the difference is reflected in the increase in investment securities of million or 
on december   a stock distribution in the form of a stock dividend was issued to shareholders of record as of december  this distribution resulted in the issuance of  shares of the company s par value common stock 
all share and per share data has been restated to reflect this stock distribution 
loans the loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial and industrial loans  commercial loans secured by real estate  loans secured by one to four family residential mortgages  and consumer loans 
substantially all of these loans are located in the upstate of south carolina and are concentrated in the company s market area 
at december   the company had no loans for highly leveraged transactions and no foreign loans 
the bank s primary focus has been on commercial lending to small and medium sized businesses in its marketplace 
commercial loans are spread throughout a variety of industries  with no industry or group of related industries accounting for a significant portion of the commercial loan portfolio 
as of december   the company had total loans outstanding  net of unearned income  of million and a loan to deposit ratio of 
the amounts represent an increase of million or from the outstanding loans of million 
the loan to deposit ratio at december  was 
outstanding loans represent the largest component of earning assets at of average earning assets for compared to for gross loans were and  respectively  of total assets at december  and the increase in loans between and is attributable to internal growth for the bank  which did not purchase any loans during the year  and the finance company s acquisition of  in loans receivable 
freedom s outstanding loans  net of unearned income  totaled million  or of consolidated loans at december  this is compared to million or of consolidated loans at december  for  the company s loans averaged million with a yield of 
this is compared to million average loans with a yield of in the interest rates charged on loans of the bank vary with the degree of risk  maturity and amount of the loan 
competitive pressures  money market rates  availability of funds  and government policy and regulations also influence interest rates 
loans of the finance company are regulated under state laws which establish the maximum loan amounts and interest rates  and the types and maximum amounts of fees  insurance premiums  and other costs that may be charged 
the increase in the loan yield during reflects the general rising rate environment experienced in early at which time the prime lending rate increased basis points 
approximately of the bank s loan portfolio and of the consolidated loan portfolio have variable rates and immediately reprice upwards with the increase in the prime rate 
the allowance for loan losses is established through charges in the form of a provision for loan losses 
loan losses and recoveries are charged or credited directly to the allowance 
the amount charged to the provision for loan losses by the bank and the finance company is based on management s judgment as to the amounts required to maintain an adequate allowance 
the level of this allowance is dependent upon growth in the loan portfolios  the total amount of past due loans  nonperforming loans  and known loan deteriorations and or concentrations of credit 
other factors affecting the allowance are trends in portfolio volume  maturity and composition  projected collateral values  and general economic conditions 
finally  management s assessment of potential losses based upon internal credit grading of the loans and periodic reviews and assessments of credit risk associated with particular loans is considered in establishing the allowance amount 
management maintains an allowance for loan losses which it believes adequate to cover inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
however  management s judgment is based upon a number of assumptions about future events which are believed to be reasonable  but which may or may not prove valid 
there are risks of future losses which cannot be quantified precisely or attributed to particular loans or classes of loans 
management uses the best information available to make evaluations  however  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making evaluations 
the company is also subject to regulatory examinations and determinations as to the adequacy of the allowance  which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance for loan losses and the size of the allowance in comparison to a group of peer companies identified by the regulatory agencies 
the allowance for loan losses totaled million or of total loans at the end of this is compared to a million allowance or of total loans at december  for the year ended december   the company reported net charge offs of  or of consolidated average loans 
the total net charge offs consisted of the finance company net charge offs of  of average loans of the finance company combined with the bank s net charge offs of  for the year 
this is compared to consolidated net charge offs of   for the finance company and  for the bank or of average loans for the year ended december  loans past due days and greater totaled  or of gross loans at december  compared to  or 
of gross loans at december  the company continues to maintain a high quality loan portfolio

of outstanding loans  which is a relatively low level in comparison to peer banks 
generally  loans of the bank are placed on nonaccrual status at the earlier of when they are days past due or when the collection of the loan becomes doubtful 
loans of the finance company are not classified as nonaccrual  but are charged off when such become days contractually past due or earlier if the loan is deemed uncollectible 
at december  and  the bank held no other real estate owned acquired in partial or total satisfaction of problem loans 
there were no impaired loans at december  at december   one loan totaling  was considered impaired under the definitions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
the related impairment allowance at december  was zero 
deposits during  interest bearing liabilities averaged million with an average rate of compared to million with an average rate of in the increase in average volume resulted principally from account promotions during the increase in the average rate is a result of the general increasing interest rate environment during and the special promotional rates offered on money market accounts and certificates of deposit during the year 
at december   interest bearing deposits comprised approximately of total deposits and of interest bearing liabilities 
the remainder of interest bearing liabilities consists principally of federal home loan bank advances and securities sold under repurchase agreements 
the company uses its deposit base as a primary source with which to fund earning assets 
deposits grew from million at december  to million as of year end internal growth and account promotions were the principal contributors to the increase in deposits as the company did not purchase any deposits during the majority of the growth in deposits occurred in the money market account category which increased million from both certificates of deposit over  and other time deposits also increased over  primarily related to promotions during in pricing deposits  the company considers its liquidity needs  the direction and levels of interest rates and local market conditions 
the company s core deposit base consists of consumer and commercial money market accounts  checking accounts  savings and retirement accounts  now accounts  and non jumbo time deposits less than 
although such core deposits are becoming increasingly interest sensitive for both the company and the industry as a whole  these deposits continue to provide the company with a large and stable source of funds 
core deposits as a percentage of total deposits were approximately and  respectively  at december  and the company closely monitors its reliance on certificates of deposit greater than  which are generally considered less stable and more interest rate sensitive than core deposits

  net interest income net interest income is the difference between the interest earned on assets and the interest paid for the liabilities used to support those assets 
it is the largest component of the company s earnings and changes in it have the greatest impact on net income 
variations in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities and their relative sensitivity to interest rate movements determine changes in net interest income 
during  the company recorded net interest income of million  a increase from the net interest income of million 
this is compared to net interest income of million for the increase in net interest income in is directly related to the increase in the average loan and deposit volume of the bank of and  respectively 
net interest income increased in also related to the higher average loan and deposit volume of the bank which was up from by and  respectively 
for the year ended december   the company s net interest margin was  compared to in and for the net interest margin is calculated as net interest income divided by average earning assets 
the increase in is primarily related to the general rising rate environment experienced as the prime rate increased from to in march although the prime rate dropped during and into  the increase in the net interest margin between and was primarily related to the contribution of the higher level of finance company loans and increases in freedom s margin during interest income interest income for was million which was a million or increase over the million for interest income for was million 
the increases each year are primarily a result of the higher level of earning assets which averaged million  million and million in  and  respectively 
changes in average yield on earning assets also affects the interest income reported each year 
the average yield increased from in to in  and to in the majority of the increase in average earning assets between and and between and was in loans  which are the company s highest yielding assets at approximately of average earning assets at december  consolidated loans averaged million in with an average yield of  compared to million in with an average yield of  and million in with an average yield of 
the higher loan yields each year result from the increase in current market rates  higher pricing on new loan originations each year  and the contribution of the finance company as its loan portfolio continues to grow 
the second largest component of earning assets is the company s investment portfolio which averaged million yielding in this is compared to average securities of million in yielding  and million yielding for the increase in the average yield of the investment portfolio is related to the timing  maturity distribution and types of securities purchased 
specifically in  several tax free municipal securities were purchased which contributed significantly to the increase in average yield on a fully tax equivalent basis for as compared to the prior years 
the higher level of average securities each year  combined with the increases in average rate  resulted in an increase in interest income on investments of  or between and and the increase of  or between and interest expense the company s interest expense for was million  compared to million for and million for the increase in interest expense of between and and between and is directly related to the and increase in the average volume of interest bearing liabilities in and  respectively 
an increase of basis points in the average rate on interest bearing liabilities in also contributed to the higher interest expense in that year 
the higher average rate in was primarily a result of several deposit promotions with above market rates offered during the year to increase the level of core deposits as required to meet loan growth demands 
the company expects the competitive deposit rate environment to continue 
interest bearing liabilities averaged million in with an average rate of  compared to million in with an average rate of  and an average of million with an average rate of during provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses was  in   in  and  in the change in the provision each year was directly related to the level of net originations in each year as follows million in  million in  and million in another factor influencing the amount charged to the provision each year is the total outstanding loans and charge off activity of the finance company in relation to the consolidated totals 
loans of the finance company generally have higher inherent risk than do loans of the bank and thus  require a higher provision for potential losses 
estimates charged to the provision for loan losses are based on management s judgment as to the amount required to cover inherent losses and are adjusted as necessary 
other income and other expenses other income increased  or  to million in from  in and  in credit card related fees and income  the largest single item in other income  rose to  in from  in and  in the increase is related to the higher volume of transactions and merchant activity in the bank s credit card portfolio each year 
the higher amount in service charges and fees on deposit accounts  which increased in to  from  in and  in  is related to the increase in the number of bank deposit accounts and transactions subject to service charges and fees 
insurance commission fee income increased  between and and  between and related to the higher level of activity for both the bank and the finance company 
included in insurance commissions is income from annuity sales made in the bank s nondeposit investment sales department and earned commissions on credit related insurance products generated by the finance company 
the remainder of the changes in other income is related to late charge income on loans of the bank and the finance company which increased  in and  in related to the higher number of branches and customer accounts  and the level of activity in the bank s nondeposit financial services and brokerage department which resulted in increased income in of  and a decrease in of  total other expenses were million in  million in  and million in a majority of the increased expenditures each year reflects the cost of additional personnel hired to support the company s growth

these items are related directly to the normal operations of the bank and increase in relation to the increase in assets  the higher level of transaction volume  and the larger number of customer accounts 
the bank s activity accounted for a net  increase in and  increase in  primarily related to the higher level of activity and number of accounts as compared to the prior year  higher telephone  advertising  courier  and supplies expenses associated with the second bank branch added in august  and technology related consultant expenses in the remainder of the consolidated increase  or  in and  in  was generated by the activity of the finance company  including charges for credit reports  license fees  acquisition premium amortization  and office support 
freedom had offices throughout  compared to in and in income taxes the company recorded an income tax provision of   and  for   and  respectively 
the effective tax rate in each year was   and  respectively 
the increase of the effective rate in is related to the full utilization of net operating loss carryforwards in prior years  while the decrease in is related to the higher level of tax free municipal investments in that year 
capital resources total shareholders equity amounted to million  or of total assets  at december  this is compared to million  or of total assets  at december  the million increase in total shareholders equity resulted principally from retention of earnings and stock issued pursuant to the company s incentive stock option plan 
to date  the capital needs of the company have been met through the retention of earnings and from the proceeds of its initial offering of common stock 
the company believes that the rate of asset growth will not negatively impact the capital base 
the company has no commitments or immediate plans for any significant capital expenditures outside of the normal course of business 
the company s management does not know of any trends  events or uncertainties that may result in the company s capital resources materially increasing or decreasing 
the company and the bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
at december   the company and the bank were in compliance with each of the applicable regulatory capital requirements and exceeded the well capitalized regulatory standards 
the following table sets forth various capital ratios for the company and the bank at december  the company the bank well well as of capitalized as of capitalized requirement requirement total risk based capital

book value per share at december  and was and  respectively 
the company has issued six stock distributions in the form of stock dividends to shareholders between june and december interest rate sensitivity achieving consistent growth in net interest income is the primary goal of the company s asset liability function 
the company attempts to control the mix and maturities of assets and liabilities to achieve consistent growth in net interest income despite changes in market interest rates 
the company seeks to accomplish this goal while maintaining adequate liquidity and capital 
the company s asset liability mix is sufficiently balanced so that the effect of interest rates moving in either direction is not expected to be significant over time 
the company s asset liability committee uses a simulation model  among other techniques  to assist in achieving consistent growth in net interest income while managing interest rate risk 
the model takes into account interest rate changes as well as changes in the mix and volume of assets and liabilities 
the model simulates the company s balance sheet and income statement under several different rate scenarios 
the model s inputs such as interest rates and levels of loans and deposits are updated as necessary throughout the year in order to maintain a current forecast as assumptions change 
the forecast presents information over a month period 
it reports a base case in which interest rates remain flat and reports variations that occur when rates increase and decrease basis points 
according to the model  the company is presently positioned so that net interest income will increase slightly if interest rates rise in the near term and will decrease slightly if interest rates decline in the near term 
the static interest sensitivity gap position  while not a complete measure of interest sensitivity  is also reviewed periodically to provide insights related to static repricing structure of assets and liabilities 
at december   on a cumulative basis through months  rate sensitive liabilities exceed rate sensitive assets  resulting in a month period liability sensitive position at the end of of million 
when the effective change ratio the historical relative movement of each asset s and liability s rates in relation to a basis point change in the prime rate is applied to the interest gap position  the company is actually in an asset sensitive position over a month period and the entire repricing lives of the assets and liabilities 
this is primarily due to the fact that of the loan portfolio moves immediately on a one to one ratio with a change in the prime rate  while the deposit accounts do not increase or decrease as much relative to a prime rate movement 
an asset sensitive position means that the company s assets reprice faster than the liabilities  resulting in increases in the net interest income during periods of rising rates and decreases in net interest income when market rates decline 
interest rates dropped starting in july and into  and the bank s net interest margin did decline in as the yield on loans which are tied to the prime rate dropped immediately  while the majority of liabilities did not reprice until their fixed maturity dates 
however  the company s overall interest margin increased in due to the fixed rate loans of the finance company offsetting the decline at the bank 
in  the market experienced an increase in the prime rate which was apparent in the higher net interest margin the company reported in as compared to the prior year 
liquidity liquidity management involves meeting the cash flow requirements of the company 
the company must maintain an adequate liquidity position in order to respond to the short term demand for funds caused by withdrawals from deposit accounts  maturities of repurchase agreements  extensions of credit  and for the payment of operating expenses 
maintaining an adequate level of liquidity is accomplished through a combination of liquid assets  those which can easily be converted into cash  and access to additional sources of funds 
the company s primary liquid assets are cash and due from banks  federal funds sold  unpledged investment securities available for sale  other short term investments and maturing loans 
these primary liquidity sources accounted for of average assets for each of the years ended december  and  respectively 
in management s opinion  the company maintains adequate levels of liquidity by retaining sufficient liquid assets and assets which can be easily converted into cash and by maintaining access to various sources of funds 
the primary sources of short term and long term funds available through the bank include advances from the federal home loan bank  purchasing federal funds from other financial institutions  lines of credit through the federal reserve bank  and increasing deposits by raising rates paid 
summit financial corporation summit financial  the parent holding company  has limited liquidity needs 
summit financial requires liquidity to pay limited operating expenses  to service its debt  and to provide funding to its consumer finance subsidiary  freedom finance 
summit financial has million in available liquidity remaining from its initial public offering and the retention of earnings 
all of this liquidity was advanced to the finance company to fund its operations as of december  in addition  summit financial has an available line of credit totaling million with an unaffiliated financial institution  all of which was available at december  during  summit financial entered into term loan agreements with several individuals to provide liquidity for funding the operating needs of freedom 
these term loans totaled  at december  further sources of liquidity for summit financial include additional borrowings from individuals  and management fees and debt service which are paid by its subsidiary on a monthly basis 
liquidity needs of freedom finance  primarily for the funding of loan originations  acquisitions  and operating expenses  have been met to date through the initial capital investment of  made by summit financial  borrowings from an unrelated private investor  and line of credit facilities provided by summit financial and summit national bank  a sister company 
the ability of the company to pay cash dividends is dependent upon receiving cash in the form of dividends from the bank 
the dividends that may be paid by the bank to the company are subject to legal limitations and regulatory capital requirements 
prior approval of the comptroller of the currency is required if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar year exceeds the bank s net profits as defined by the comptroller for that year combined with its retained net profits as defined by the comptroller for the two preceding calendar years 
as of december   no cash dividends have been declared or paid by the bank and the bank had available retained earnings of million 
the company s management believes its liquidity sources are adequate to meet its operating needs and does not know of any trends  events or uncertainties that may result in a significant adverse affect on the company s liquidity position 
effect of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and results of operations in terms of historical dollars  without consideration of changes in the relative purchasing power over time due to inflation 
unlike most other industries  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant effect in a financial institution s performance than does the effect of inflation 
the yield on a majority of the company s earning assets adjusts simultaneously with changes in the general level of interest rates 
over of the company s liabilities are issued with fixed terms and can be repriced only at maturity 
during periods of rising interest rates  as experienced in early  the company s assets reprice faster than the supporting liabilities 
this causes an increase in the net interest margin until the deposits mature and are repriced at higher current market rates  thus narrowing the difference between what the company earns on its assets and what it pays on its liabilities 
given the company s current balance sheet structure  the opposite effect that is  a decrease in net interest income is realized in a falling interest rate environment as was experienced in the latter part of and into accounting  reporting and regulatory matters in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
this statement became effective for transactions occurring after december  the statement uses a financial components approach that focuses on control to determine the proper accounting for financial asset transfers 
under that approach  after financial assets are transferred  an entity would recognize on its balance sheet all assets it controls and liabilities it has incurred 
the entity would remove from the balance sheet those assets it no longer controls and liabilities it has satisfied 
the adoption of this statement has not had a material effect on the company s financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 deferral of the effective date of certain provisions of sfas no 
 an amendment to sfas no 
which is effective december  this statement delays the effective date of certain provisions of sfas no 
until january  the amended provisions include those related to the transfers of financial assets and secured borrowings 
the provisions in sfas no 
related to servicing assets and liabilities are not delayed by this amendment 
the company does not anticipate that adoption of this standard will have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 earnings per share  which is effective for both interim and annual periods ending after december  this statement supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 earnings per share 
the purpose of this statement is to simplify current reporting and make us reporting comparable to international standards 
the statement requires dual presentation of basic and diluted eps by entities with complex capital structures as defined by the statement 
the adoption of this standard has not had a material effect on eps 
the company has restated its prior year eps to conform to this statement 
also  in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosure of information about capital structure  which is effective for financial statements for periods ending after december  this statement applies to both public and nonpublic entities 
the new statement requires no change for entities subject to the existing requirements 
the company anticipates that adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on the company 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  which establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general purposes financial statements 
under this statement  enterprises are required to classify items of other comprehensive income by their nature in the financial statement and display the balance of other comprehensive income separately in the equity section of a statement of financial position 
statement is effective for both interim and annual periods beginning after december  comparative financial statements provided for earlier periods are required to be reclassified to reflect the provisions of the statement 
the company will adopt statement effective march  and will provide the required disclosures in the company s form q for the first quarter of also in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
this statement establishes standards for the way public enterprises are to report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires those enterprises to report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports issued to shareholders 
statement is effective for financial statements for periods beginning after december  in the initial year of application  comparative information for earlier years is to be restated  unless it is impractical to do so 
it is not anticipated that the adoption of this statement will materially effect the company s current method of financial reporting 
in june of  the fasb issued an exposure draft of a proposed statement accounting for derivatives and similar financial instruments and for hedging activities 
under the proposed standard  all derivatives would be measured at fair value and recognized in the statement of financial position as assets or liabilities 
although the final standard has not been issued  the fasb has expressed publicly that a final statement would be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  because the company has no derivative activity at this time  management does not expect that this standard  if adopted in its presently proposed form  would have a significant effect on the company 
year the company recognizes that there is a business risk in computerized systems as the calendar rolls into the next century 
the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec issued an interagency statement on may   providing an outline for institutions to effectively manage the year challenges 
the company has developed an ongoing plan designed to ensure that its operational and financial systems will not be adversely affected by year software failures due to processing errors arising from calculations using the year date 
the company has an internal task force assigned to this project and the board of directors and management of the company have established year compliance as a strategic initiative 
the company is well into the assessment phase of the project in which all critical applications are identified and programing issues determined 
while the company believes that it has available resources to assure year compliance  it is to some extent dependent on vendor cooperation 
at the present time  the company expects its most critical application software vendors to have all systems compliant by june  at which time testing will commence and will be substantially completed by december  the company has established time lines for testing all noncritical software and ancillary systems  such as telephone systems and security devices by the fourth quarter of at this time  the company has not determined the cost of making modifications to correct any year problems  however  equipment and software expenses are not expected to materially differ from historical levels 
the company upgrades and purchases technologically advanced software and hardware on a continual basis and expects to specifically evaluate and test such purchases for year compliance 
the company is also in the process of addressing any loan relationships it believes could be materially effected by the year issue 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk arises principally from interest rate risk inherent in its lending  deposit and borrowing activities 
management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure 
although the company manages other risks  as in credit quality and liquidity risk  in the normal course of business  management considers interest rate risk to be its most significant market risk and change in interest rates could potentially have the largest material effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
other types of market risks  such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities 
the company s profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
management s goal is to maintain a reasonable balance between exposure to interest rate fluctuations and earnings 
a sudden and substantial increase in interest rates may adversely impact the company s earnings to the extent that the interest rates on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent or on the same basis 
the bank s asset liability management committee alco monitors and considers methods of managing the rate and sensitivity repricing characteristics of the balance sheet components consistent with maintaining acceptable levels of changes in net portfolio value npv and net interest income 
net portfolio value represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities  with adjustments made for off balance sheet items over a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
a primary purpose of the company s asset and liability management is to manage interest rate risk to effectively invest the company s capital and to preserve the value created by its core business operations 
as such  certain management monitoring processes are designed to minimize the impact of sudden and sustained changes in interest rates on npv and net interest income 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed on a periodic basis by the board of directors and the alco 
interest rate risk exposure is measured using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine the company s change in npv in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates 
further  interest rate sensitivity gap analysis is used to determine the repricing characteristics of the bank s assets and liabilities 
the alco is charged with the responsibility to maintain the level of sensitivity of the bank s net portfolio value within board approved limits 
interest rate sensitivity analysis is used to measure the company s interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in npv of its cash flows from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet items in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
this analysis assesses the risk of loss in market risk sensitive instruments in the event of a sudden and sustained basis points increase or decrease in the market interest rates 
the company s board of directors has adopted an interest rate risk policy which establishes maximum allowable decreases in npv in the event of a sudden and sustained increase or decrease in market interest rates 
the following table presents the company s projected change in npv for the various rate shock levels as of december  all market risk sensitive instruments presented in this table are held to maturity or available for sale

 the preceding table indicates that at december   in the event of a sudden and sustained increase in prevailing market interest rates  the company s npv would be expected to increase  and that in the event of a sudden decrease in prevailing market interest rates  the company s npv would be expected to decrease 
at december   the company s estimated changes in npv were within the limits established by the board of directors 
computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes included in these forward looking statements are subject to certain risks  uncertainties  and assumptions including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and deposit decay rates  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the company could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
the company also uses interest rate sensitivity gap analysis to monitor the relationship between the maturity and repricing of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities
