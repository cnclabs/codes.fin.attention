item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview lst s revenues are derived from steel s three business segments oilfield products  specialty tubing products  and flat rolled steel and other tubular products and services 
products and markets 
the oilfield products business includes the manufacture and marketing of octg  the casing and tubing used in oil and gas well drilling and production  and line pipe that is used to gather and transport oil and gas from the well site to storage or refining facilities 
steel is one of the largest domestic producers and suppliers of octg  based on data compiled by the american iron steel institute 
octg represents over three fourths of steel s oilfield products volume as measured in tonnage  and exports have ranged from approximately to of this segment s shipments during the last three years 
demand for oilfield products is generally affected by customers expectations of future oil and gas prices and political factors such as energy and trade policies 
a key indicator of domestic demand is the average number of drilling rigs operating in the united states 
according to baker hughes  the average united states rig counts in   and were   and  respectively 
demand is also affected by the amount of oilfield products imported into this country as well as available industry inventories 
imported octg represented approximately of the apparent supply in and in and  as compared to in a reduction of imported octg from levels experienced in the to period resulted from the imposition of protective tariffs on certain foreign countries in these trade tariffs  which were intended to promote an equitable trade environment  remained in effect during because these protective tariffs cover significant octg producing countries in asia  the level of imported octg has not substantially changed as a result of currency devaluations and general slowdowns in certain asian economies at the end of the effect of available inventory increased in significance last year as octg mills operated near their full productive capacity 
the volatility of oil and gas prices creates uncertainty with respect to the timing and extent of increased activity in the energy sector 
this affects customer confidence in the longer term outlook for energy prices and as a result some drilling projects may be deferred 
however  domestic markets strengthened considerably in as oil and gas prices were at levels needed to justify additional exploration and production spending while efficiencies from new oilfield technologies continued to lower costs associated with these activities 
steel s specialty tubing products segment includes two product groups drawn over mandrel dom tubing and as welded tubing 
specialty tubing consists of a wide array of high quality  custom made steel tubular products requiring critical tolerances  precise dimensional control  and special metallurgical properties 
these products are used in the further manufacture of automotive  construction  and other industrial equipment such as hydraulic cylinders  stabilizer tubes and intrusion devices  and machine parts 
specialty tubing is used in a wide range of industrial applications and  therefore  demand is sensitive to general economic conditions 
demand increased during and open orders were up at year end as compared to year end international shipments of dom specialty tubing were   and of shipments in   and  respectively 
steel s participation in the flat rolled steel commodity market is generally concentrated in the southwestern region of the united states and is affected by factors such as price  capacity utilization  and raw material costs 
flat rolled steel produced by steel is primarily used by steel in the manufacture of tubular products  but is also sold to customers for the manufacture of a variety of commercial and industrial products 
flat rolled steel is sold in highly competitive markets  with price  quality  and availability primarily determining customer purchase decisions 
manufacturing 
the manufacture of steel s products is capital intensive 
utilization rates rose significantly during at steel s manufacturing facilities 
certain facilities were utilized in excess of of capacity for significant periods during the level of production volume through steel s various facilities has a significant effect on the cost of manufacturing 
key variable costs include costs of raw materials  including scrap steel  steel slabs  coils  electricity  and natural gas 
steel has entered into certain marketing alliances and manufacturing arrangements with unrelated companies involving the marketing of their products and processing of flat rolled steel provided by steel into tubular products which provides steel access to additional manufacturing capacity 
steel is under a capital expenditure program for the to period totaling approximately million 
this program is designed to improve quality and lower costs and will be financed from operating cash flows and available borrowings under steel s revolving credit facility 
results of operations consolidated revenues reported in the statements of earnings are as follows in millions oilfield products revenues specialty tubing products revenues flat rolled steel and other tubular revenues consolidated net revenues shipments of products by segment are as follows in tons oilfield products    specialty tubing products    flat rolled steel and other tubular products    total tons shipped    compared with net revenues of million increased over net revenues from oilfield products improved to million in shipment volumes and prices were up from levels by and  respectively 
demand for steel s octg rose as land based drilling increased in this was reflected in the average domestic rig count which increased to in from in demand was also favorably impacted by the reduction in imported octg resulting from the continuation of duties imposed on products from certain countries 
specialty tubing products revenues increased by to million from higher shipment volumes with flat prices 
shipment volumes were up due to additional automotive sales  robust construction activity  and strengthening demand in the overall economy 
steel achieved higher shipments with new capacity from the expansion of its specialty tubing facilities in late flat rolled and other tubular products net revenues were up to million due to higher realized prices with flat shipment volumes 
gross earnings improved to million in from million in the improvement was due to higher shipments of oilfield and specialty tubing products combined with small price increases for oilfield products and flat rolled steel 
increased production volumes also resulted in improved gross margins as raw material costs were essentially unchanged from selling  general  and administrative expenses increased to million from million in due to additional selling expenses associated with higher sales and continued modernization of computer systems 
interest income decreased million in from to million primarily due to usage of million of invested funds in january to buy the remaining minority interest in steel 
interest expense of million was million less than due to the conversion of lst s million subordinated debentures at the end of august into million shares of lst s common stock 
other income  net 
net other income of million and million for and  respectively  consisted of nonrecurring miscellaneous items 
earnings from continuing operations for improved to million  or per diluted share  from million  or per diluted share  in the improvement was due to higher shipment volumes  small price increases for oilfield products and better gross margins 
extraordinary items totaling million  or 
per diluted share  reflect a million prepayment charge on the refinancing of steel s revolving credit facility and a million gain related to reduction of prior reserves for united mine worker s claims 
gain from discontinued operations of million  or 
per diluted share  resulted from receipt of escrowed proceeds of million from the prior sale of american federal bank 
net earnings of million  or per diluted share  included earnings from continuing operations of million  extraordinary items of million and gain from discontinued operations of million 
compared with net revenues increased to million in from million in net revenues of oilfield products increased to in from million in shipment volumes and prices increased in from levels by and  respectively  as the average domestic rig count increased to in from in as in  demand for steel s octg was favorably impacted due to the reduction in imported octg resulting from the continuation of protective tariffs on imported products from certain countries  and by the types of drilling being conducted  such as deep water drilling in the gulf of mexico  which increased the industry s requirements for larger diameter  higher grade products for which steel is most competitive 
specialty tubing products net revenues decreased by to million in from million in primarily attributable to weak demand from steel service centers which was partially offset by increased demand from automobile manufacturers 
for the specialty tubing product group  shipment volume and price decreased by and  respectively 
flat rolled and other tubular products net revenues were down to million in from million in due to lower average selling prices 
gross earnings improved to million in from million in this was attributable to increased shipments and prices of oilfield products and a decrease in the cost of steel slabs 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  primarily due to additional sales expenses as product sales increased and additional spending to modernize management information systems 
interest income was million less in than in as short term interest rates were lower on average in than in interest expense for decreased million from million in  reflecting average lower borrowings in on steel s revolving credit facility compared to other income  net 
net other loss in consisted of miscellaneous items totaling of million 
net other income in was million and included million from the gain on sale of approximately  acres of land in east texas 
earnings from continuing operations and net earnings for were both million or per diluted share 
for  net earnings and earnings from continuing operations were both million or per diluted share 
financial condition and liquidity at december   lst had available cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  and marketable securities totaling million 
also  at year end steel had a million revolving credit facility  under which it had million of availability  after reduction for borrowings and outstanding letters of credit 
this million facility replaced another million credit facility from other lenders in october under the new credit facility interest is payable under one of two rate options at the london interbank offered rate libor plus an index which is based on quarterly debt ratio calculations or the institution s prime lending rate 
at december   the rate was and was indexed at over libor 
steel also pays an indexed rate on the unused portion of the credit facility  which at december  was per annum 
the term of the agreement is through october the revolving credit agreement also includes requirements to maintain minimum net worth levels  meet certain financial ratios and restricts steel s ability to incur additional indebtedness 
on august   lst s million subordinated debentures were converted into million shares of lst common stock 
steel requires capital primarily to fund general working capital needs and capital expenditures 
principal sources of funds include cash generated by operations and borrowings 
steel believes that funds generated by operations and its borrowing capacity under the revolving credit agreement will provide the liquidity necessary to fund its cash requirements during steel s operations are subject to restrictive environmental compliance and permitting requirements of various governmental agencies that include the tnrcc and the epa 
steel believes that the cost of maintaining compliance with environmental requirements will fall within its contemplated operating and capital expenditure plans  averaging million annually in the foreseeable future 
lst and steel have completed an assessment of certain year issues on various computer related systems 
necessary changes outlined in an implementation plan for corrective actions are being made 
it is expected that the required changes will be made by year to preclude any material adverse consequences 
corrective actions are estimated to cost million in and are being funded primarily from ongoing computer systems operating budgets 
lst and steel are in the process of conducting an additional assessment of certain year issues on steel s manufacturing equipment  time based operating equipment  and significant suppliers  which will be completed in it is anticipated that corrective actions  if any  will be made by year lst has no direct business operations other than steel or significant sources of cash other than from short term investments or the sale of securities 
lst is reimbursed by steel for most of its operating costs as provided by its cost sharing agreement with steel 
under steel s revolving credit agreement  funds can be distributed to lst from unrestricted net worth  which at december  was million 
unrestricted net worth increases by of steel s future net earnings less distributions 
at year end  restricted net worth was million 
lst periodically purchases steel slabs which are consigned to steel for use in its production process and thereby affords steel somewhat longer payment periods for this raw material 
steel pays lst as the slabs are used plus interest on unpaid amounts 
during  lst s slab purchases amounted to approximately million 
in november  lst sold the stock of afb  one of its operating subsidiaries  to guaranty federal bank  fsb gfb 
the sale price was million  of that  lst received million in cash on the date of the sale  million in november  and million was in escrow to pay for certain gfb claims pursuant to the sale agreement 
during august of  lst received million from the escrow in final settlement of all outstanding claims and recognized the same amount as gain from discontinued operations
