the company s october acquisition of alma is not expected to affect this trend because alma historically has experienced similar seasonality in its revenues and operating income 
should the company not continue to realize increased revenues in future third and fourth quarter periods  profitability for any affected quarter and the entire year could be materially and adversely affected due to ongoing selling  general and administrative expenses that are largely fixed over the short term

future acquisitions may include much larger businesses than those acquired to date 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be successful in consummating further acquisitions due to factors such as receptivity of potential acquisition candidates and valuation issues 
additionally  there can be no assurance that future acquisitions  if consummated  can be successfully assimilated into the company
