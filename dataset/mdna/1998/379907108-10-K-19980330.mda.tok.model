the value of construction activity in johnson county rose in  to billion 
johnson county s unemployment rate was between and throughout  about half the national rate 
johnson county has a more competitive banking environment than the company s other markets  but the county s level of economic activity and business growth have enabled business at exchange bank s two offices there to grow rapidly since their establishment in and a third johnson county office of exchange bank opened in shawnee in the first quarter of other local markets where the banks operate generally did not experience the rapid growth seen in johnson county  but their economies were stable and sound  reflecting a mix of agriculture  manufacturing and other industries

influences on earnings the company s net income depends upon the combined results of operations of the banks  each of which conducts a commercial and consumer banking business by attracting deposits from the general public and redeploying those funds to earning assets 
each bank s profitability depends primarily on net interest income  which is interest income on interest earning assets less interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
interest earning assets include loans  investment securities and other earning assets  such as federal funds sold 
interest bearing liabilities include customer deposits  time and savings deposits and other borrowings such as federal funds purchased  short term borrowings and long term debt  including junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures 
besides the balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  net interest income is affected by each bank s interest rate spread 
this spread is the difference between the bank s average yield on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the interest rate spread is impacted by changes in interest rates  deposit flows and loan demand  among other factors 
the company s profitability is also affected by the level of non interest income of the banks and non interest expense of the company and the banks 
non interest income consists primarily of service fees  other fees  and gains on the saleof mortgage loans and investment securities 
non interest expense consists of compensation and benefits  occupancy related expenses  deposit insurance premiums  expenses of opening branch offices  acquisition related expenses and other operating expenses 
the company s profitability is further impacted by the effective tax rate  the banks provision for loan losses  and various non recurring items 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and the company s net income was million for the year ended december   an increase of from million for the year ended december  the primary reason for the earnings increase was a increase in net interest income as a result of significantly higher loan volume  coupled with an improved net interest margin 
the company s acquisition of farmers in the fourth quarter of also contributed to higher earnings  as did cost management effortsthat improved the company s efficiency ratio 
in addition  net income in was negatively impacted by a one time  industry wide savings association insurance fund saif assessment by the fdic on saif assessable deposits  which was paid in the third quarter of these results yielded an improvement in annual return on average assets roa to for the year ended december   compared with for the previous year 
return on average common stockholders equity roe was for the year ended december   compared with for the year ended december   primarily due to increased equity capital following the initial public offering in late total assets were million at december   an increase of from million at december  the growth in assets was achieved both through acquisitions and through internal growth in  particularly in the johnson county locations

net interest income total interest income was million for the year ended december   a increase from the increase was primarily the result of growth in total average interest earning assets of approximately million  combined with improved yield on interest earning assets 
total interest expense was million for  or higher than in  as a result of an increase in total interest bearing liabilities  partially offset by slightly lower interest rates paid 
average total interest bearing liabilities increased by million or for compared to  primarily due to the increased volume of deposits originated by exchange bank in connection with the opening of its leawood location and increased short term borrowings to fund loan demand in johnson county 
exchange bank has offered slightly above market rates in an effort to attract and retain deposits in order to fund loan growth 
the company intends to periodically offer above market rates in certain markets to gain market share and liquidity 
net interest income was million for  up from this increase is due to significantly greater loan volumes  primarily from exchange bank s leawood and shawnee locations  as well as a net interest margin in compared with in for the year ended december   total interest income was million  a increase from the previous year

although these deposits are maturing  a substantial portion of such deposits has been retained

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses for the year ended december   was  an increase of  over this increase reflects the company s recognition of strong expansion in its loan business 
the allowance represented of total loans as of december   and of total loans as of december  for the year ended december   the provision for loan losses was  compared to million for the negative provision in was a result of management s estimate of the required reserve  coupled with loan recoveries realized in the fourth quarter of by peoples national bank  a subsidiary acquired by the company in a pooling transaction in non interest income non interest income for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of from  primarily as a result of reduced gains on sales of mortgage loans at provident bank

in addition to this special one time assessment  the premiums for bif deposits were increased to basis points per of deposits and for saif deposits were decreased to basis points per of deposits 
the new premiums took effect january   and continue through december  non interest expense increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to the company experienced an increase in professional services expenses as a result of legal and accounting expenses associated with the company s recent acquisitions and its obligation to comply for the first time with the periodic reporting requirements of the securities and exchange commission imposed on publicly held companies 
this was partially offset by the ongoing centralization of certain administrative functions  increases in operating efficiencies  and the realization of cost savings 
non interest expense was million for the year ended december   a increase from this increase was primarily due to the addition of employees at the newly opened leawood location and provident bank s mortgage loan production office and also was affected by annual increases in salaries and employee benefits and the addition of two executive positions at the company 
net occupancy expense increased due to remodeling projects that were completed in shawnee and st

the effective tax rate was lower than subsequent years  primarily because a larger portion of income before taxes in came from tax exempt securities 
asset liability management asset liability management refers to management s efforts to minimize fluctuations in net interest income caused by interest rate changes 
this is accomplished by managing the repricing of interest rate sensitive interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
an interest rate sensitive balance sheet item is one that is able to reprice quickly  through maturity or otherwise 
controlling the maturity or repricing of an institution s liabilities and assets in order to minimize interest rate risk is commonly referred to as gap management 
close matching of the repricing of assets and liabilities will normally result in little change in net interest income when interest rates change 
a mismatched gap position will normally result in changes in net interest income as interest rates change 
along with internal gap management reports  the company and the banks use an asset liability modeling service to analyze each bank s current gap position 
the system simulates the banks asset and liability base and projects future net interest income results under several interest rate assumptions 
the company strives to maintain an aggregate gap position such that changes in interest rates will not affect net interest income by more than in any twelve month period 
the company has not engaged in derivatives transactions for its own account 
the following table indicates that  at december  if there had been a sudden and sustained increase in prevailing market interest rates  the company s net interest income would be expected to increase  while a decrease in rates would indicate a decrease in income 
changes in net interest percent interest rates income change change basis point rise   basis point rise   base rate scenario  basis point decline   basis point decline   the following table sets forth the maturities of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december  interest rate sensitivity analysis as of december  term to repricing zero to four months over one over three to twelve to five five months months years years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets loans      investment securities      other interest bearing assets   total interest earning assets      interest bearing liabilities savings deposits and interest bearing checking   time deposits     short term borrowings     long term borrowings    total interest bearing liabilities      interest sensitivity gap     cumulative gap     cumulative ratio of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities ratio of cumulative gap to interest earning assets the cumulative gap value indicated above for the zero to five year time periods indicates that a rise in interest rates would have a positive effect on net interest income 
the company has the ability to reprice the rates on savings deposits and interest bearing checking 
historically the rates on these deposits have not been repriced when rates have had small movements 
financial condition lending activities commercial loans 
this category includes loans to service  retail  wholesale and light manufacturing businesses  including agricultural service businesses 
commercial loans were million as of december   or of total loans 
the proportion of commercial loans increased in  due primarily to exchange bank s expanding business in shawnee and leawood 
provident bank has also increased its commercial loan portfolio 
real estate loans 
real estate loans represent the largest class of loans of the company 
the company categorizes real estate loans as follows i commercial 
commercial real estate loans increased from december  to december   due primarily to increased lending activity in the johnson county suburbs southwest of kansas city 
ii construction 
construction lending consists primarily of single family construction in johnson county 
the company has experienced steady growth in the suburban kansas city market  and the december  balance reflects continued  although seasonal  growth in the johnson county market 
iii to family residential 
loans in this category consist primarily of owner occupied residential loans 
since december  the mix of loans has begun to shift from fixed rate loans to variable rate products 
the company has elected to portfolio selected variable rate real estate loans  which has resulted in the loan growth in this category 
iv agricultural 
this category consists of loans secured by agricultural real estate 
the demand for agricultural real estate loans has remained flat due to an historically low turnover of farm property 
v held for sale 
loans held for sale represent residential loans intended to be sold to secondary market investors and in the process of being delivered 
agricultural loans 
agricultural loans are typically made to farmers  small corporate farms and feed and grain dealers 
agricultural loans were million as of december   or of total loans 
the proportion compared to total loans has been relatively stable  as the company s acquisitions have added to agricultural loans  while internal growth has been stronger in other categories 
agricultural loan demand  generally  has remained stable due to a stable agricultural economy 
consumer and other loans 
loans classified as consumer and other loans include automobile  residential  other personal loans and credit card loans 
the majority of these loans are installment loans with fixed interest rates 
consumer and other loans were million as of december   or of total loans  only slightly changed from the proportion a year earlier 
the company issues credit cards to its existing customers

asset quality the company s asset quality compares favorably to its peer institutions 
the company follows regulatory guidelines in placing loans on a non accrual basis and places loans with doubtful principal repayment on a non accrual basis  whether current or past due 
the company considers non performing assets to include all non accrual loans  other loans past due days or more as to principal and interest with the exception of those loans which in management s opinion are well collateralized or exhibit other characteristics suggesting they are collectable  other real estate owned oreo and repossessed assets 
the company does not return a loan to accrual status until it is brought current with respect to both principal and interest and future principal payments are no longer in doubt 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  any previously accrued and uncollected interest income is reversed 
restructured and impaired loans are considered insignificant for all periods presented 
the company would have recorded additional interest in the amounts of   and  for the years ended december   and respectively  if non accrual loans had been current during these periods 
non performing assets are summarized in the following table non performing assets at december  dollars in thousands loans loans days or more past due but still accruing non accrual loans  non performing loans  other assets oreo non performing assets   non performing loans as a percentage of total loans non performing assets as a percentage of total assets allowance for loan losses the success of a bank depends to a significant extent upon the quality of its assets  particularly loans 
this is highlighted by the fact that net loans represented of the company s total assets as of december  in originating loans  there is a substantial likelihood that some credit losses will be experienced 
the risk of loss will vary with general economic conditions  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan and the quality o f the collateral in the case of a collateralized loan  among other things 
management maintains an allowance for loan losses based on industry standards  management s experience  historical experience  an evaluation of economic conditions and regular reviews of delinquencies and loan portfolio quality 
based upon such factors  management makes various assumptions and judgments about the ultimate collectability of the loan portfolio and provides an allowance for potential loan losses based upon a percentage of the outstanding balances and for specific loans if their ultimate collectability is considered questionable 
since certain lending activities involve greater risks  the percentage applied to specific loan types may vary 
the company actively manages its past due and non performing loans in each bank to minimize credit losses and monitors asset quality to maintain an adequate loan loss allowance 
although management believes its allowance for loan losses is adequate for each bank and collectively  there can be no assurance that the allowance will prove sufficient to cover future loan losses 
further  although management uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used or adverse developments arise with respect to non performing or performing loans 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover loan losses or that significant increases to the allowance will not be required in the future if economic conditions should worsen 
material additions to the allowance for loan losses would result in a decrease of the company s net income and capital and could result in the inability to pay dividends  among other adverse consequences 
the allowance for loan losses on december   totaled million  a million increase from a year earlier  resulting from charge offs of  recoveries of  provisions of  and additional adjustments of  related to the purchase of farmers bank

the investment portfolio is structured to maximize the return on invested funds within conservative risk management guidelines 
the portfolio is comprised of us treasury securities  us government agency obligations  state municipal obligations  federal reserve bank stock  fnma stock  and fhlb stock 
the us government agency obligations include federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc  fnma notes and mortgage backed securities  fhlb notes and government national mortgage association gnma mortgage backed securities

federal funds sold are not classified as investment securities 
the investment portfolio decreased  or  during the year ended december   and increased million  or  for the year ended december  the decreases are primarily due to strong loan demand

the average balance of the investment portfolio as of december  represented of average earning assets as compared to on december  in  the company invested in trading securities for the purpose of generating additional non interest income 
the company intends to turn over these securities as market conditions dictate in order to maximize their profitability 
the company periodically changes its balance sheet strategy to accommodate a new interest rate environment when  in management s opinion  economic and policy signals indicate a changing trend in interest rates 
accordingly  in the first half of the company sold bonds in anticipation of an increase in interest rates

in addition to deposits  the banks derive funds from interest payments  loan principal payments  loan and securities sales  and funds from operations 
scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds  while deposit inflows are significantly influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions 
the banks may use borrowings on a short term basis if necessary to compensate for reductions in the availability of other sources of funds  or borrowings may be used on a longer term basis for general business purposes 
deposits are attracted principally from within the banks primary market area through the offering of a broad variety of deposit instruments  including checking accounts  money market accounts  savings accounts  certificates of deposit including jumbo certificates in denominations of  or more  and retirement savings plans 
the banks have aggressively attempted to obtain deposits in selected markets to increase market share or meet particular liquidity needs 
the company has not used brokered deposits and has not sought to attract deposits outside its market areas 
maturity terms  service fees and withdrawal penalties are established by the banks on a periodic basis 
the determination of rates and terms is predicated on funds transaction and liquidity requirements  rates paid by competitors  growth goals and federal regulations 
the growth in deposits is primarily the result of the company s relatively new locations in leawood and shawnee 
during the company experienced an increase in savings and interest bearing transaction accounts with balances of less than  the non interest bearing account balance as of december   showed a million or increase from the balance as of december  the average balance increased accordingly by million or primarily as a result of growth at the company s shawnee and leawood locations

liquidity defines the ability of the company and the banks to generate funds to support asset growth  satisfy other disbursement needs  meet deposit withdrawals and other fund reductions  maintain reserve requirements and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis 
the immediate liquidity needs of the banks are met primarily by federal funds sold  short term investments  deposits and the generally predictable cash flow primarily repayments from each bank s assets 
intermediate term liquidity is provided by the banks investment portfolios 
the banks also have established a credit facility with the fhlb under which the banks are eligible for short term advances secured by real estate loans or mortgage related investments 
the company s liquidity needs and funding are provided through non affiliated bank borrowing  cash dividends and tax payments from its subsidiary banks 
capital 
the company and the banks actively monitor their compliance with regulatory capital requirements 
the elements of capital adequacy standards include strict definitions of core capital and total assets  which include off balance sheet items such as commitments to extend credit 
under the risk based capital method of capital measurement  the ratio computed is dependent on the amount and composition of assets recorded on the balance sheet and the amount and composition of off balance sheet items  in addition to the level of capital 
historically  the banks have increased core capital through the retention of earnings or capital infusions 
each bank s ability to incur additional indebtedness or to issue or pay dividends on common stock may be limited by regulatory policies and the terms of the outstanding securities 
at december   the company s tier risk based capital  total risk based capital and leverage ratios were  and  respectively  compared to minimum required levels of  and  respectively subject to change and the discretion of regulatory authorities to impose higher standards in individual cases

impact of inflation and changing prices the primary impact of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on the performance of a financial institution than do changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices 
interest rate changes do not necessarily move in the same direction or have the same magnitude as changes in the prices of goods and services

this is accomplished by managing the repricing of interest rate sensitive interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
an interest rate sensitive balance sheet item is one that is able to reprice quickly  through maturity or otherwise 
controlling the maturity or repricing of an institution s liabilities and assets in order to minimize interest rate risk is commonly referred to as gap management 
close matching of the repricing of assets and liabilities will normally result in little change in net interest income when interest rates change 
a mismatched gap position will normally result in changes in net interest income as interest rates change 
along with internal gap management reports  the company and the banks use an asset liability modeling service to analyze each bank s current gap position 
the system simulates the banks asset and liability base and projects future net interest income results under several interest rate assumptions 
the company strives to maintain an aggregate gap position such that changes in interest rates will not affect net interest income by more than in any twelve month period 
the company has not engaged in derivatives transactions for its own account
