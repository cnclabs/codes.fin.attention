item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
background the company was organized by an investment group including odyssey partners  lp  allen company incorporated allen company and affiliates of first chicago corporation to make a cash tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of research cottrell  inc rci and its subsidiaries  collectively  research cottrell  including metcalf eddy  inc the research cottrell acquisition was completed on july  the acquisition 
as a result of the acquisition  the company incurred approximately million in debt and recorded approximately million in goodwill 
the company s results of operations since the acquisition have been adversely affected by the interest expense related to the acquisition debt  which was refinanced in  and the amortization of goodwill 
see notes to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
results of operations the company operates principally in two segments psg which is focused on the operation of water and wastewater treatment facilities and metcalf eddy which is focused on engineering consulting in the areas of water wastewater and hazardous waste remediation 
on december   the company announced its decision to divest research cottrell 
see financial condition 
demand for the company s services and technologies demand for the company s services and technologies arises principally from three sources 
need for governmental agencies to reduce costs through productivity improvements and improve the quality of services  
upgrade of existing facilities and the need for new capacity at water and wastewater treatment facilities and various industrial pollution sources  such as waste incineration and industrial process plants  which must comply with existing environmental legislation and regulations  and 
regulations mandating new or increased levels of water pollution control  water supply and solid waste management as well as remediation of contaminated sites 
dependence on key projects and government contracts in any given period  a substantial percentage of the company s sales is dependent upon several large projects 
to the extent that these projects are canceled or substantially delayed and not replaced  it could have a material adverse impact on the company s sales and earnings 
approximately of the company s fiscal year gross revenues were derived from contracts with federal  state  municipal and other governmental agencies 
the termination of any of the company s significant contracts with such governmental agencies  or the failure to obtain either extensions or renewals of certain existing contracts or additional contracts with such governmental agencies  could have a material adverse effect on the company s earnings and business 
in fiscal year  the contract of psg s wholly owned subsidiary  ps group of puerto rico  inc psg puerto rico  with prasa accounted for of psg puerto rico s total sales and of the company s total sales 
operations were initiated under the contract on september  the contract has a five year term but prasa may cancel the contract for any reason after august  pursuant to the contract  psg puerto rico manages wastewater plants  water treatment plants and related collection and distribution systems and pumping stations in puerto rico 
the contract s profitability is contingent upon achieving certain contract incentives 
in addition  at october  psg puerto rico had receivables of million due from prasa for certain reimbursable costs 
see financial condition 
psg puerto rico is in the process of negotiations with prasa regarding a replacement contract for the existing five year contract 
management currently expects that the contract with prasa will not be canceled by prasa in august  but will remain in effect through its original five year term ending august or be amended or replaced with a new contract 
additionally  the prasa employees who operate the prasa facilities are subject to a collective bargaining agreement which expires in june summarized below is certain financial data including information relating to the company s business segments 
fiscal years ended october  in thousands sales professional services group    metcalf eddy    other and eliminations    cost of sales professional services group    metcalf eddy    other and eliminations   selling  general and administrative ex penses professional services group    metcalf eddy    other  corporate unallocated    depreciation and amortization professional services group    metcalf eddy    other corporate unallocated impairment charge professional services group metcalf eddy other corporate unallocated  operating income loss professional services group    metcalf eddy    other corporate unallocated    interest expense  net    other expense  net  income tax expense benefit  loss from continuing operations    income loss from discontinued operations 
   net loss    fiscal year ended october  compared to fiscal year ended october  overview as discussed in more detail with the comparison of each segment s results  the company s net loss increased from million during the year ended october  to million including losses from discontinued operations of million during the year ended october  this was primarily the result of certain operating charges and asset write offs  including charges taken in connection with the planned research cottrell divestiture  all as more fully described below 
sales have decreased from million to million primarily due to lower metcalf eddy sales volumes as a result of delays in awards of new contracts 
at october   the company s total backlog was approximately billion and consisted of psg and metcalf eddy 
revised business strategy during the second quarter of  the company completed a review of its operations three year business plans 
these plans included a detailed analysis of markets  growth opportunities and forecasted three year operating results  cash flows and return on capital employed for each business segment 
as a result of this review  management considered the actions necessary to redeploy its capital to psg and metcalf eddy  its core water business 
the strategic analysis conducted led to the conclusion that the company did not have the overall size and expertise to grow the air pollution control businesses profitably 
among other factors contributing to this approach were recent tax law changes which may extend the duration of om m contracts and create additional opportunities within the water and wastewater treatment markets which are the primary markets for psg and metcalf eddy 
see business the water wastewater privatization market 
furthermore  the returns on capital employed within the psg and metcalf eddy segments are forecasted to be greater than the returns for the research cottrell segment 
from a competitive standpoint  management also believes that the company has greater competitive advantages and market penetration through its psg and metcalf eddy businesses than what has been achieved by its research cottrell operations 
as a result of the above  management assessed the impact of de emphasizing the research cottrell business segment and redeploying its capital to its psg and metcalf eddy segments 
a financial advisor was retained to assist the company in exploring strategic alternatives related to this redeployment 
on december   the company announced its decision to divest research cottrell 
the company is currently in negotiations with several interested parties and expects that most of the air pollution control businesses operated through research cottrell will be sold within the next several months 
professional services group operating income was million for the year ended october  and reflects a million decrease from the comparable period primarily due to certain operating charges and asset write offs which approximated million 
these charges were primarily related to professional fees of million related to marketing consultants  the doj investigation and certain litigation matters  and provisions of million for revised collectibility estimates for certain non current note receivables 
excluding the effect of the aforementioned charges  the operating results were million higher than the comparable period due to the timing of certain contractual incentive clauses realized under the prasa project 
sales remained comparable to the prior period as a result of the privatization market developing more slowly than anticipated 
although the company has been successful in obtaining contract renewals  it continues to experience delays in negotiating and closing new business opportunities due to municipal clients implementation schedules 
metcalf eddy the operating loss of million for the year ended october  was primarily the result of million of charges  including million of provisions required in order to properly reflect the company s revised estimates for the collectibility of certain receivables based on recent adverse developments in contract negotiations and collection efforts  million of increases to its reserves for litigation  professional liability and certain project contingencies due to revised estimates of the expected outcome of certain unasserted and asserted claims and litigation incurred in the normal course of business  million of equipment write offs  a million charge related to a cancellation penalty for a high cost leased facility  and other direct and indirect costs of million 
in addition to the effect of the aforementioned charges  lower sales volume and gross margin rates and higher depreciation expenses  partially offset by lower selling  general and administrative expenses  reduced the operating results by million from the comparable prior period ended october  the reduction in sales volume of million during the period reduced the operating results by million due to delays in obtaining task order releases primarily within the hazardous waste remediation service lines  several contracts which were awarded to competitors and delayed procurement in international markets 
delays are increasing due to funding and administrative issues with certain government agencies eg  the environmental protection agency the epa and the department of defense 
the lower gross margin rates reduced the operating results by million during the period primarily due to favorable pricing adjustments reflected in the prior periods  pricing pressures and a business mix shift from self performed work to subcontracted work 
partially offsetting the lower margins were selling  general  and administrative expense reductions of million during the year ended october  as compared to the comparable period as a result of lower personnel related costs including discretionary and self insured employee benefit costs 
the million increase in depreciation and amortization from the comparable prior period primarily resulted from the reduction of the estimated useful lives of computer equipment 
corporate and other the unallocated corporate costs were comparable to the prior period except for the million impairment charge related to the branchburg  new jersey property which is anticipated to be sold 
in addition  higher average borrowings resulted in increased interest expense 
discontinued operation research cottrell the loss from discontinued operations for the year ended october  was million including a loss on disposal of million  significant operating charges of million  other operating losses of million and non operating expenses of million 
the loss on disposal was developed using a range of estimated proceeds based on current negotiations with several potential buyers of the businesses and also includes estimated future losses of million through the estimated disposal date 
the significant operating charges include a million impairment charge recognized during the second quarter primarily related to a writedown of goodwill and other non current assets of ecodyne and kvb  receivable provisions of million at ecodyne and r c international  warranty provisions of million at r c international and custodis and million of higher than anticipated costs on a specific apcd project 
in addition to the loss on disposal and significant operating charges  the remaining operating loss was due to lower sales volume and reduced margin rates as a result of fewer bid opportunities due to delays in issuing new air quality standards by the epa  lack of enforcement of existing standards  price pressures from highly competitive markets and project execution 
fiscal year ended october  compared to fiscal year ended october  overview as discussed in more detail with the comparison of each segment s results  the company s net loss decreased from million during the year ended october  to million during the year ended october  the results for the year reflected decreases in operating margins primarily for psg due to the highly competitive marketplace and increases in selling and marketing expenses primarily for psg which were partially offset by overhead reductions within metcalf eddy and corporate 
sales increased from million to million primarily due to increased service revenues associated with psg s contract with prasa 
at october   the company s backlog was approximately billion and consisted of psg and metcalf eddy 
professional services group operating income was million for the year ended october  and reflects a million decrease from the comparable prior period due to additional selling  general and administrative expenses as well as depreciation and amortization related to growth initiatives which were partially offset by higher gross margins 
the increase in psg s sales is a result of the prasa contract which began september  and has not had a proportional impact on operating income 
metcalf eddy although sales remained comparable to the prior year  metcalf eddy s operating income increased by million during the year ended october  the higher operating income was attributable primarily to personnel  facilities and insurance cost reductions which resulted in a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses of million 
in addition  estimated favorable pricing adjustments partially offset the impact of unfavorable sales mix to more design build and construction type projects 
corporate and other the corporate unallocated selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million during the year ended october  due to cost reduction efforts  including personnel related costs and professional fees 
the results for the year compared to the prior year were also favorably impacted by slightly lower financing costs and the favorable resolution of several pending tax issues 
research cottrell income from discontinued operations increased by million primarily due to an increase in non operating income in partially offset by a decrease in operating income 
operating income decreased by million during the year ended october  from the comparable prior period 
the changes in operating income reflect the decreases in margin rates in most business units caused by price pressures from highly competitive markets  unfavorable product line mix and project execution 
partially offsetting the reduced margins were lower selling  general and administrative expenses of million during the year ended october  primarily at its apcd and kvb operations 
international sales volume continued to increase by million due to improved market penetration during the aforementioned period  however  the higher sales related to international activities were more than offset by lower sales volume in kvb of million during the year ended october  kvb s lower sales volume  compared with the prior period  was due to the fulfillment of orders for equipment required by utility customers to comply with the clean air act amendments of financial condition during the year ended october   cash generated by operating activities was million including million from discontinued operations 
the operating activities of continuing operations generated million after interest payments of million 
the million increase in receivables and million increase in payables were primarily related to psg puerto rico s contract with prasa under which certain unreimbursed costs paid on behalf of prasa have not been collected million at october   and the payment of certain power costs to the puerto rico electric power authority prepa million at october  has been delayed 
on december  prepa filed a complaint in civil court in puerto rico against psg puerto rico seeking payment by psg puerto rico of prasa s power costs 
to the company s knowledge  process was never served in respect of such suit 
psg puerto rico paid approximately million to prepa on december   shortly following receipt of such amount from prasa as a partial payment 
on january   the complaint was withdrawn by prepa without prejudice 
management believes that such receivables will be fully collected and will be used to pay the power costs due to prepa 
the cash generated from discontinued operations was primarily related to various working capital reductions of research cottrell due to lower sales volume and the sale of certain businesses 
the company typically has receivables in which the ultimate realizability is dependent upon the successful negotiation or resolution of contractual issues or disputes as well as the client s ability to fund and pay the amounts due 
historically  significant charges have been reflected as provisions for receivable reserves and write offs including those reflected in the current period 
management believes that adequate provisions have been made to the receivable balances reflected in the october  financial statements  however  additional provisions may be required in the future based on new developments which may arise in the near term related to the factors discussed above 
investment activities required million of cash during the year ended october  including million for research cottrell s capital expenditures 
investments related to the start up of operations  maintenance and management of treatment facilities within the psg segment were million 
capital expenditures of million were made in the psg and metcalf eddy segments primarily for computer and field equipment and leasehold improvements 
proceeds of million from the sale of certain research cottrell operations and other assets were also received during the year 
as discussed more fully below  significant investments may be required in the near term due to current growth initiatives 
financing activities required million of cash during the year ended october  primarily due to the payment of cash dividends of million paid on the series a preferred stock and fees of million related to the recapitalization  partially offset by net borrowings under credit facilities of million discussed more fully below 
on september   the company  cge and anjou entered into the recapitalization agreement  whereby the company would restructure its debt with a portion of the gross proceeds from the rights offering as defined hereinafter and retire all of the outstanding shares of its series a convertible exchangeable preferred stock  par value 
per share the series a preferred stock 
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the recapitalization agreement will reduce the company s annual interest expense by approximately million and eliminate million of annual dividends on the series a preferred stock 
see certain relationships and related transactions recapitalization agreement 
on august   the company entered into a million seven year unsecured revolving credit facility with anjou the anjou note 
the facility matures on august  as of october   the company s outstanding borrowings under the facility totaled million 
the anjou note bears interest at libor london interbank offered rate plus at october  
the company expects to repay the anjou note with a portion of the gross proceeds from the rights offering 
in connection with the investment agreement  the company and cge entered into a credit agreement  dated as of june   pursuant to which the company received a million unsecured term loan from cge the cge note 
the cge note bears interest at one  two  three or six month libor  as selected by the company  plus at october   as defined  and has a final maturity of june  the cge note contains certain financial and other restrictive covenants with respect to the company relating to  among other things  the maintenance of certain financial ratios  and restrictions on the sale of assets and the payment of dividends on or the redemption  repurchase  acquisition or retirement of securities of the company or its subsidiaries 
the company expects to repay the cge note with a portion of the gross proceeds from the rights offering 
the company also maintains the three year senior secured bank credit facility  dated as of march   with the first national bank of chicago and societe generale  co agents for a syndicate which includes seven additional banks the lending banks 
the bank credit facility was increased by million to million as of april  as of october   the company s borrowings under the bank credit facility totaled million and outstanding letters of credit under the bank credit facility totaled million unused capacity of million 
as of december   the configuration and structure of the bank credit facility was revised 
as a result of this revision societe generale purchased and assumed from all of the other lending banks all of such banks rights and obligations under the bank credit facility  becoming the sole lending bank thereunder  and the company and societe generale entered into an amendment the amendment to extend the bank credit facility until december  the bank credit facility had been scheduled to expire on march  the amendment waives the company s compliance with certain covenants and amends others 
the prior amendments and waiver would have terminated on december  had the bank credit facility not been amended 
following the recapitalization  the company intends to enter into discussions regarding the establishment of a new credit facility following the maturity of the bank credit facility 
cge also has reaffirmed to societe generale the terms of cge s existing credit support of the company  including a commitment by cge to maintain a minimum voting equity ownership interest and to check to ensure that the company will have sufficient financial resources to meet its obligations under the bank credit facility 
the bank credit facility is primarily designed to finance working capital requirements  subject to certain limitations  and provide for the issuance of letters of credit  and is secured by a first security interest in substantially all of the assets of the company 
of the total commitment  borrowings are limited to the lesser of million or the sum of a percentage of certain eligible receivables  inventories  net property  plant and equipment and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  and bear interest at libor plus at october   or at a defined bank rate approximating prime at october  
the bank credit facility also allows for certain additional borrowings  including  among other things  project financing and foreign borrowing facilities  subject to limitations  and contains certain financial and other restrictive covenants  including  among other things  the maintenance of certain financial ratios  and restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  acquisitions  the sale of assets  the payment of dividends and the repurchase of subordinated debt 
in addition  the related agreement requires cge to maintain its support of the company  including a minimum voting equity ownership interest in the company and its right to designate at least of the company s board of directors as well as to appoint the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of the company 
the company compensates cge for its support in an amount equal to per annum of the outstanding commitment of its credit facilities million  million and million for the years ended october   and  respectively 
the company s ability to comply with the financial and other covenants in such agreements beyond march  is substantially dependent upon the completion of the rights offering 
failure to complete the rights offering may require additional waivers or amendments to the bank credit facility 
there can be no assurance that such waivers or amendments could be obtained 
in the absence of a waiver or amendment  societe generale would have the right to refuse any further extensions of credit and the right to accelerate payment of all outstanding amounts under the bank credit facility 
in addition  substantially all of the company s long term debt and certain other financial and non financial obligations contain cross default or acceleration provisions 
in the event the company were required to repay accelerated outstanding amounts under the bank credit facility and other obligations  the company does not believe that it will have financial resources adequate to repay such amounts and to satisfy its ongoing working capital requirements 
therefore  the failure to complete the rights offering could have a material adverse effect on the company s business prospects and on its financial condition and liquidity 
as of january   the company had bank credit facility borrowings of million and outstanding letters of credit under the bank credit facility of million 
in addition to the million of unused capacity under its bank credit facility at january   the company believes it can finance its ongoing operations in the near term including additional working capital requirements if a growth in sales occurs  but excluding the significant investments discussed below through improved working capital management by focusing on metcalf eddy s past due receivables  asset divestitures related to the research cottrell segment and reduction of financing costs through the strengthening of its current capital structure as contemplated by the recapitalization 
a significant amount of planned asset divestiture proceeds is expected to fund the related retained liabilities  however  the cash outlays may occur during different periods 
the businesses of the company have not historically required significant ongoing capital expenditures 
for the years ended october   and total capital expenditures were million  million and million  respectively 
at october   the company had no material outstanding purchase commitments for capital expenditures  however  following the recapitalization  the company will require additional financial resources to develop and support each of its business at psg and metcalf eddy  to undertake related long term capital expenditures or other investments and to participate in the emerging privatization market in the wastewater management industry 
cge has informed the company that it intends to work with the company to explore various ways to develop such financial resources for these purposes  including  among others  the raising by cge of an investment fund or other off balance sheet vehicle which would invest  on a case by case basis  in various project financings undertaken by the company 
it is anticipated that any such vehicle would invest in such project finance activities of the company on terms which are commercially reasonable 
as a result  cge and the company and possibly others  investing either directly through such vehicle or otherwise  would share in the returns on such projects pro rata in relation to their respective equity investments 
the company is often required to procure bid and performance bonds from surety companies  particularly for clients in the public sector 
a bid bond guarantees that the company will enter into the contract under consideration at the price bid and a performance bond guarantees performance of the contract 
in august  usf g notified the company that it would suspend the renewal and issuance of new bid and performance bonds as of september   due to the company s operating performance and resulting financial condition as reported at the end of the fiscal quarter ended april   unless it received indemnification from cge or anjou for at least of all future bond requests including renewals 
anjou has entered into an agreement with usf g regarding an arrangement pursuant to which  until terminated at anjou s discretion  anjou will enter into guarantees of certain obligations of the company relating to the bonding of certain contracts under the master surety agreement dated as of october   between usf g and the company and its subsidiaries 
such guarantees would cover  in each instance  of the aggregate amount of the bonds executed  procured or provided on behalf of the company or its subsidiaries on or after october  and certain penalty amounts  up to million 
there can be no assurance that usf g will be willing to provide bid and performance bonds to the company following the recapitalization without a guarantee from cge or one of its affiliates  and there can be no assurance that cge would be willing to provide such a guarantee following the recapitalization 
see results of operations dependence on key projects and government contracts 
the realizability of goodwill and other long lived assets is the result of an estimate based on the underlying assets remaining estimated useful lives and projected operating cash flows 
it is possible that this estimate will change as a consequence of further deterioration in market conditions and operating results 
the effect of a change  if any  would be material to the financial condition or results of operations 
at october   unamortized goodwill was million 
year issue based on a preliminary study by management  the company expects to incur approximately million during and to modify its information systems appropriately to accurately process information in the year and beyond 
the company continues to evaluate appropriate courses of corrective action  including replacement of certain systems whose associated costs would be recorded as assets and amortized 
management expects that the costs to convert the company s information systems to year compliance will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements
