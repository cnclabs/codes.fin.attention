the tri cities  washington market consists of the cities of richland  kennewick and pasco in the state of washington

the performance of a radio station group  such as the company  is customarily measured by its ability to generate broadcast cash flow 
although broadcast cash flow is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  the company believes that broadcast cash flow is accepted by the broadcasting industry as a generally recognized measure of performance and is used by analysts who report publicly on the performance of broadcasting companies 
nevertheless  this measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income  net income  net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure for determining the company s operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with gaap 
the primary source of the company s revenues is the sale of advertising time on its radio stations 
the company s most significant station operating expenses are employee salaries and commissions  programming expenses and advertising and promotional expenditures 
the company seeks to reduce expenses at the stations by implementing cost controls  operating the stations as groups in their respective markets and lowering overhead by combining and centralizing administrative and financing functions of its stations 
the company s revenues are primarily affected by the advertising rates that its radio stations charge 
the company s advertising rates are in large part based on a station s ability to attract audiences in the demographic groups targeted by its advertisers  as measured principally by the arbitron company an independent rating service on a quarterly basis 
because audience ratings in local markets are crucial to a station s financial success  the company endeavors to develop strong listener loyalty 
the company seeks to diversify the formats on its stations as a means to insulate it from the effects of changes in the musical tastes of the public in any particular format 
the number of advertisements that can be broadcast without jeopardizing audience levels and the resulting ratings is limited in part by the format of a particular station 
the company s stations strive to maximize revenue by constantly managing the number of commercials available for sale and adjusting prices based upon local market conditions 
in the broadcasting industry  radio stations often utilize trade or barter agreements which exchange advertising time for goods or services such as travel or lodging  instead of for cash 
the company generates most of its revenue from local advertising  which is sold primarily by a station s sales staff 
during fiscal year  approximately of the company s revenues exclusive of citadel jsa fees received were from local advertising 
to generate national advertising sales  the company engages independent advertising sales representatives that specialize in national sales for each of its stations 
the radio broadcasting industry is highly competitive 
the financial results of each of the company s stations are dependent to a significant degree upon its audience ratings and its share of the overall advertising revenue within the station s geographic market 
see item business competition 
the company s revenues vary throughout the year 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  the company s first calendar quarter generally produces the lowest revenues for the year  and the fourth calendar quarter generally produces the highest revenues for the year 
the company s operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of the advertising and promotion is realized in future periods 
see item business seasonality 
following the passage of the telecom act  the doj indicated its intention to investigate certain existing industry practices that had not been previously subject to anti trust review 
the doj is investigating the citadel jsa in connection with the concentration of radio station ownership in the colorado springs  colorado and spokane  washington markets 
in a recent case unrelated to the company  the doj has  for the first time  requested the termination of a radio station jsa that  in the opinion of the doj  would have given a radio station owner  together with its proposed acquisition of other radio stations in the area  control over more than of radio advertising revenue in the area 
the citadel jsa provided approximately of the company s net revenues in fiscal year in the event that the doj requires the termination or modification of the citadel jsa  the company believes that such termination or modification would have a favorable long term impact on the company s operations  although the company may suffer a short term disruption in sales efforts caused by the transition  because the company s income from the citadel jsa  which is a share of the combined profits of the stations involved in the citadel jsa  currently is negatively impacted by a disproportionate share of the combined operating expenses 
the company has begun preparations for an orderly transition in the event that the doj requires the termination of the citadel jsa

giving effect to the little rock disposition  as of december  the company had borrowed million under the amended credit agreement  had million available to finance operations and million available to finance additional acquisitions 
the company s ability to borrow funds under the amended credit agreement is conditioned on meeting certain financial ratios as well as those imposed by provisions of the depositary shares 
therefore  the maximum amounts which might become available under the facility  and the maximum amounts actually available to the company at any particular time may be less 
the amended credit agreement provides that  during the pendency of an event of default  the company s ability to pay cash dividends with respect to the depositary shares will be restricted 
the amended credit agreement consists of four senior secured credit facilities 
the first facility is a revolver in the maximum amount of million the initial revolver 
the initial revolver bears interest at a rate based  at the company s option  on libor or an alternative base rate which is substantially equivalent to the lenders prime rate 
the interest rate may vary from libor or the alternative base rate to libor or the alternative base rate  based upon the company s consolidated leverage ratio 
the amount available under the initial revolver decreases on a quarterly basis  in amounts ranging from  per quarter beginning july  to approximately million per quarter beginning in currently  with the company s borrowings under the initial revolver at million  the first principal payment will be due on july  the final maturity of the initial revolver is april  the second facility is a term loan in the maximum amount of million the term loan 
the term loan will bear interest at libor or the alternative base rate

as of december   the company did not meet certain financial covenants 
the company s lenders have granted it waivers as of december  with respect to these covenants 
management believes that it is probable that it will not comply with one of these covenants in its quarterly tests during and the lenders have indicated that they are only willing to grant waivers on a quarter by quarter basis 
accordingly  the entire debt outstanding under the amended credit agreement has been reclassified as a current liability on its balance sheet for the year ended december  based on discussions with its lenders  management is confident that  if required  it will be able to obtain the appropriate waivers in the future 
however  in the event that such waivers are not granted  management  after consultation with its regular financing sources  believes that the company would be able to refinance the amended credit agreement on acceptable terms 
the company has incurred additional indebtedness pursuant to the pinnacle acquisition consisting of a note in the amount of  to havelock bank of lincoln  nebraska  which the company assumed from the prior owners and which was repaid in november  and notes to the prior owners which require a payment of million on each of may  and the purchase price of the pinnacle acquisition may be increased by million if the university of nebraska renews its contract with the company in for a minimum of an additional three year term and the payment of such would be required at the time the renewal is obtained 
while renewal of the contract with the university of nebraska cannot be assured  based on discussions the company has had with the university of nebraska  the company presently knows of no reason why the contract would not be renewed 
additionally  under the company s broadcast rights agreement with the university of nebraska  annual rights fee payments of approximately million during the year ended december  and approximately million during the year ended december  are due on october of each year  or  at the option of the company each year  may be paid in seven equal principal installments plus interest at the prime rate 
during the year ended december   it is anticipated that the company will be able to meet its capital needs  including interest expense  dividends  corporate expense  capital expenditures and other commitments  from cash on hand  cash provided from operations which assumes continued substantial improvement in the operating results of the company s radio stations  and additional borrowings which may be available under the amended credit agreement 
there can be no assurance  however  that the stations will achieve the cash flow levels required to meet its capital needs 
the company s ability to make these improvements will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to legal  financial  business  regulatory  industry and other factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
the company will be required to incur additional indebtedness or raise additional equity financing to fund its operations in the event that its operations do not improve and in connection with possible future acquisitions of radio properties and is likely to need to incur or raise such additional financing when the balloon payments are due in under the amended credit agreement 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to incur such additional indebtedness or raise additional equity on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
without such sources of funding  it is unlikely that the company will be able to continue to implement its acquisition strategy 
the company is aware that its current group of radio stations combined with the trend towards consolidation in the industry may present an attractive opportunity to maximize stockholder value through a sale of the company s assets or by the combination of the company s business with that of a larger broadcasting company 
the company will continue to consider all available opportunities and has engaged goldman  sachs co 
to actively explore alternatives to maximize stockholder value 
potential year problems it is possible that the company s currently installed computer systems  software products or other business systems will not always accept input of  store  manipulate or output dates in the year or thereafter without error or interruption the year issue 
the company is conducting a review of its computer systems to attempt to identify ways in which its systems could be affected by problems in correctly processing date information 
at this time  the company does not expect the year issue to have a material adverse effect on its operations 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will identify all date handling problems in its computer systems in advance of their occurrence or that the company will be able to successfully remedy problems that are discovered 
the expenses of the company s efforts to identify and address such problems  or the expenses or liabilities to which the company may become subject as a result of such problems  though unlikely  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition
