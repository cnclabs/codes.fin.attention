the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period

the company s contracts at airports with fewer international passengers generally require more constant staffing throughout the year 
therefore  the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  quarterly variations in its results of operations principally as a result of the seasonality of air travel primarily to and from europe 
while the effects of seasonality on ahl s business often are obscured by the timing of the addition of new clients and the commencement of new services for existing clients  the company s operating income tends to be lower in the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal year and highest in the third quarter of the fiscal year 
additionally  the company s operating margin tends to be lower in the fourth quarter because of the occurrence of holidays during which the company pays overtime wages to employees 
under certain of the company s contracts  the company is not entitled to recoup the cost of these overtime wages 
liquidity and capital resources to support its rapid growth  ahl has historically relied on borrowings under its bank revolving credit facility 
in may  the company entered into a three year  million revolving bank line of credit to replace the company s prior million revolving credit facility 
in february  the company expanded the credit facility the credit facility to million of which million is available in foreign currencies through a syndication of five banks  lengthened the term to five years and lowered the interest rate 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at the prime rate  the federal funds rate plus basis points or libor plus basis points 
the credit facility is collateralized by substantially all of the company s assets 
in addition  the credit facility is subject to certain restrictive covenants 
as of december   there was approximately million outstanding under the credit facility 
cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal compared to cash provided by operating activities of million for fiscal this decrease was the result of the increase of million in net income before depreciation and amortization and extraordinary items offset by million of changes in working capital due to increase in accounts receivable as a result of the increase in revenues and the timing of payments of accounts payable and accrued expenses 
cash used in investing activities for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal this was principally the result of the five acquisitions completed in as compared to only one in as well as increased expenditures on capital assets  primarily transportation and computer equipment 
cash provided by financing activities for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal the increase was principally the result of proceeds from the public offerings of common stock in  net of expenses  of million offset by an increase in net payments of debt of million  as compared to cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal as compared to cash used in operating activities of million in fiscal this increase was primarily the result of the increase of million in net income before depreciation and amortization and by million of changes in operating assets  primarily accounts receivable  accrued salaries and related benefits payable 
these changes were consistent with the company s higher volume of business 
cash used in investing activities for fiscal was million as compared to million in fiscal  principally as a result of the intersec acquisition made in july cash provided by financing activities for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal  principally representing changes in borrowings under the company s credit facility and issuance of the subordinated notes associated with the intersec acquisition 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
historically  capital expenditures have been  and future expenditures are anticipated to be  primarily to support expansion of the company s operations and management information systems 
the company s capital expenditures over the next several years  as a percentage of its revenues  are expected to be generally consistent with those of the past three fiscal years 
the company completed its initial public offering of common stock in march  raising net proceeds of approximately million 
these proceeds were used to repay all outstanding amounts under the company s credit facility  to repurchase an outstanding warrant and to retire other outstanding acquisition related debt 
the company completed a follow on offering in october  raising net proceeds of approximately million 
these proceeds were used to repay outstanding debt used to fund acquisitions of approximately million with the balance for general corporate purposes  including working capital to support the company s growth and acquisitions 
the company believes that funds generated from operations  together with existing cash and borrowings under the credit facility  will be sufficient to finance its current operations  planned capital expenditure requirements  additional acquisitions and internal growth for at least the next several years 
if the company were to make a significant acquisition for cash  it may be necessary for the company to obtain additional debt or equity financing 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its results of operations in recent years 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
year the company has determined that the year issue will not have a material effect on its business  operations or management information systems
